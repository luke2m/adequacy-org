<i>Adequacy's primary writers have no problems with ad hominem attacks, atrocious fact-checking and gratuitous obscenities. Stories range widely in their topics, from conspiracies to religion to animals.  Their categorical story icon for "Animals" is a raccoon having sex with a dog.  The root purpose of the site is to offend, misinform and laugh at others.  It falls squarely in with The Stile Project as horrible Internet pariah site, with less porn but more cursing and bullshit, and definitely as much hatred of the greater world.</i>

It's horribly inaccurate, oddly biased, and to top it all off they misspelled Linux. I thank you for writing this awful article, as it has givin (sic) me a new definition of stupid. </i>

<i>Adequacy is almost universally hailed as one of the most idiotic sites on the 'net today, and is the subject of an enormous amount of ridicule from those who have an ounce of dignity about them. The relationship between adequacy and the rest of the people on the 'net is roughly analogous to the relationship between Scientology and the rest of the world.</i>

<i>I have been to the site and skimmed the headlines. I don't really understand their mission statement. It says two compleatly [sic] contradictoy [sic] things. The articles don't seem to be that strange. I don't really understand what the site is all about.</i>

<i>Geez, Adequacy needs to stop taking it'self [sic] so seriously.... Adequacy's purist stance reeks of the elitist stuffiness that's usually attributed to old media.</i>

<i>I find your website rude and offensive in every aspect. I can [sic] care less about the fucking first amendment so don't feed me shit about you being protected. I am not American, i do not need to abide by Americans legalities. I especially like the part about hacking you have in there "How to tell if your son is a hacker" I guarantee you will succumb to the full wrath of what a teenage hacker can do. You can shove your website up your ass, I am currently in the process of taking it down.</i>

<I>I start thinking to myself that this site couldn't possibly get any weirder or stupider, here you go publishing a story like this. This, I have to say, is totally baffling. Time and again I come across posts and stories that read like the babblings of a febrile two year old shot up with acid. It's like a cultural trainwreck.</I><BR>-- Anonymous Reader, <a href="/">Adequacy.org</a>
