      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><h4>Devious, secretive and glorified vocabulary</h4>

<p>One of the things about the German language for which one hears much
praise is it's supposed "logicalness". However, German is far from a
logical language. To put it succintly, German is complex, and unoriginal
where not arcane.

<p>Just ask yourself: what kind of rational justification can there be
for the Germans to base anything but their very basic vocabulary (as
opposed to technical vocabulary) on germanic words, instead of doing
like the rest of the world and basing it on Latin and Ancient Greek?
And why do they go on inventing mile-long compound words for concepts
other European languages use either short figurative words or classical
borrowings for?

<p>Contrary to what they may tell you, Germans simply don't have
any sort of superior ideas on how to create words. Countless words
in German are just vile calques from classical words; for instance
<i>Flu�pferd</i>: <i>Flu�</i> = "river", which in ancient Greek is
<i>thamus</i>; <i>Pferd</i> = "horse", which is Greek <i>hippus</i>.
<i>Flu�pferd</i> is thus nothing but a pretentious germanic-root ripoff
of the Greek word <i>hippopotamus</i>. Whichever purpose they have in
forming words like that must be devious-- they could as well have used
"Hippopotamus" as other european languages do, and let us know what they
mean!

<p>However, anybody who has learned German from scratch can see just
what the purpose is to all this nonsense, with just a little thought.
The primary operative principle of German vocabulary is to hide meaning
from non-Germans, not to communicate ideas.

<p>Let's look at a very typical situation for learners of German as a
final example. Say you are reading a document in German, and you come
across one of German's abundant 5 stem words. Then you have to look
up each of the five stems in the dictionary. So you look up stem 1,
then stem 2, ... stem 5, and by that time you've forgotten the first 2
stems. So you look them up again, and realize you forgot stem 3. Well,
you write them all down with their meanings in order to avoid that.
What now? According to the Germans since German is "logical", and of
course, by knowing what each part means, there is no way you can fail to
understand the whole.

<p>Let's assume you somehow manage to split the stems up right in the
first place. Let's further assume that you find the right bracketing
for the stems (the number of which rises exponentially as you add
stems). You know which words go together to form a unit that goes with
another unit. Even then, the claimed "logicalness" fails for 2 stem
words. If I told you the English equivalent of <i>Ich habe ein Flu�pferd
gesehen</i>, "I have seen a riverhorse", how could you guess it's a
hippo unless you already knew that the combination meant that? Hell, if
you tried to make a logical guess, you'd guess that it was a kind of
horse, thus you'd get the very first thing wrong, just because you were
trying to be logical!


<h4>Verb final ordering: the syntactic reflex of authoritarian
culture</h4>

German is famously known for having verb final order in its sentences.
While the basic order for a main clause in most European languages
(e.g. English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Finnish, Greek, etc.)
is Subject-Auxiliary-Verb-Object (also known as <b>SVO order</b>, or
<b>verb-medial</b>), the basic schema for a German main clause is
Subject-Auxiliary-Object-Verb ("I have a foreigner killed" instead of
<i>I have killed a foreigner</i>). Technically speaking, the German
pattern is known as an <i>SOV order prepositional language with second
position auxiliaries</i>. Practically speaking, it is fascist culture
incarnate.

<p>It's impossible to make sense of a sentence until you've heard all
the <i>core participants</i> (the subject and the objects) and the event
being described (the verb). With SVO order, the core participants and
the event come very early in the sentence, so it's possible to tell
early on what the main message of the sentence is:

<ul>
<li>John has seen Mary.
<li>John has seen Mary in bed.
<li>John has seen Mary in bed with his boss.
<li>John has seen Mary in bed with his boss yesterday.
<li>John has seen Mary in bed with his boss yesterday afternoon.
</ul>

In all these sentences, "John has seen Mary" conveys the event with its
core participants; it is manages to express a whole thought. The stuff
afterwards is just additional details. In these sentences, right after
each of "Mary," "bed," "boss," "yesterday," and "afternoon" we have a
<i>syntactic completion point</i>, a place where we could end the
sentence having expressed a full thought.

<p>Compare this to the German counterparts:

<ul>
<li>Jan hat Marie gesehen.
<li>Jan hat Marie in Bett gesehen.
<li>Jan hat Marie in Bett mit der Herr gesehen.
<li>Jan hat gestern Marie in Bett mit der Herr gesehen.
<li>Jan hat gestern abend Marie in Bett mit der Herr gesehen.
</ul>

<p>While in English, each further elaboration added a syntactic
completion point, in German, no matter how much we elaborate, we get
only one syntactic completion point, after <i>gesehen</i> "seen".

<p>This is self-evidently a sign of the authoritarian nature of German
culture. From birth, children are brought up listening to the commands
of their parents attentively, not missing a single of their words,
knowing that they have to patiently wait while all the modifiers and
elaborations of the central sense go by, in order to get the crucial
information about what the event being described is, which only arrives
at the very end, with the verb.

<p>The SVO syntax of other European languages frees the speakers from
having to attend to every single word in the sentence, and thus leaves
them with time to question the truthfulness, sanity and moral character
of what's being communicated by his interlocutor, which is essential if
freedom and democracy are to flourish. But this is not so for German.
Verb-final syntax requires unfettering attention to the speaker for as
long as he may choose to drag on with a single sentence; the hearer
is too busy anticipating the syntactic completion point, and can't
contemplate the bigger implications of what is being said: "Is the
speaker trying to build a better world for all of us, or just trying to
spread evil? No time to tell, gotta wait for that verb."

<p>The most valued speech style in German is one that piles modifier
upon modifier on extra-long sentences, which hearers battle to make
sense of while awaiting the crucial ending moment, when the verb
arrives and puts it all together. Thus the imagic model of Germanic
sentential syntax is an authoritarian one; the speaker almost literally
holds his audience captive, under great interpretive pain, giving them
only ocassional relief whenever he feels like it. By virtue of being
socialized in such an environment, the German soon comes to crave power,
both in this verbal form and in the physical form. One need only witness
recent German history to grasp this.

<p>As a further argument, consider the makeup of the two sides in
World War II. On the Allied side were Britain, France, the USSR and
the US as the major players-- all countries which speak SVO languages.
In the Axis side the only other major player apart from the Germans
were the Japanese-- and their language, unsurprisingly enough, has an
even stronger tendency for head-final order than German (while German
has prepositions and articles which come before nouns, Japanese has
postpositions and articles which follow nouns-- everthing goes at the
end!). This was a crucial yet little apreciated front on which WWII
was fought: the linguistic front, verb final culture vs. verb medial
culture. Mediality, along with its associated democratic values, came
out on front. Do we really want to sacrifice this important victory by
allowing the Germans to go on speaking their language, telling each
other things that (as seen in the first section above) they take great
pains to hide from us?

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

German grammar is organized in such a way as to hide meaning from
outsiders, and to support authoritarian inclinations. We need
to start a massive reliteracy program for Germans; otherwise,
they will rise again like they have done in the past, since
deceptiveness and authoritarianism is deeply embedded in their
culture, as can be witnessed in their language. I, of course,
recommend that this reliteracy program be implemented with <a

And indeed. if you look at the history of the Germans, one can see that they <em>have</em> always had an authoritarian culture.<BR><BR>
It can be broken up into different stages:<ul>
<li>Primitive Germans. These were tribes of Germans who were <em>so</em> attached to the cult of the tribal leader, that unlike SVO countries such as Britain, France, Spain, etc etc, they didn't once submit to the <i>Pax Romana</i>, preferring instead to stick to their primitive ways, worshiping their tribal cheiftans unthinkingly and rejecting one of the greatest civilisations the world has seen and doing so time and time again through 900 years.
<li>Medieval Germany. The era of the Holy Roman Empire and the numerous city states that crowded Germany, each with its own tinpot dictator. Unlike other parts of the world, the Germans were incapable of uniting into a Reich, due to the strong bonds many felt to their Liege Lord. A hallmark of being unable to think independantly.
<li>Modern Germany. This continued till the 1880's, when Bismark, that cruel, ambitious dictator realised that the only way to unite Germany was through brute force of persuasion. Where other countries were well on the road to democracy and universal sufferage, the Germans were still pissing about with an all powerful monarch, power dressing and a tribal society. Their unquestioning obedience led them to challenge the SVO countries for global dominance in WWI, desirous as they were for an Empire, at the same time said more civilised SVO countries were well on the road to disestablishing their Empires.
<li>Nazi Germany. This wasn't really a change; it was just more of the same. Adolf Hitler wasn't any nicer or more civilised that Kaiser Wilhelm - although he was more entitled to rule, seeing as he was <em>voted in</em>. Nazi Germany was just business as usual for Germany.
<li>Recent Germany. More of the same. Germany isn't democratic, for example - it has a silly, rigged PR system of government which makes the votes of the people irrelevant - and they don't care. Modern Hitlers such as Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroder are able to drag Germany towards a new destiny in Europe <em>without even asking them</em> for consent. This shows a total disregard for democracy and the old, distinctly German, love for Strongman politics.
</ul>
Say what you like, but the author of this article was perfectly correct; Germany is writ through with a history of fascist behaviour, and has been for 5000 years or more, continuously. Attempts by people like you to rewrite history will be exposed.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<BR>
First off, this whole article is of course crap, I'm a German, I've grown up here, I lived in the US and I KNOW. To judge a whole country by two aspects of it's language is just so unbelievably stupid I don't even want to think about it.
<BR>

<BR>
And then to have somebody say that today's Germany isn't democratic and that Kohl and Schroeder are "modern Hitlers" is just so unbelievably stupid. Just because Germany doesn't have direct democracy (i.e. the people vote 'I like this law' or 'I don't like this law) but instead they vote for a party, which in turn votes for laws and different kinds of measures doesn't mean a country is ruled under a dictatorship. This is handled like this in many other countries as well. And, talking about Europe, all treaties have to be ratified by the German Parliement, so there is your democracy that you are missing.
<BR>

<BR>
To take the US as an example, the political system here is much more undemocratic than in Germany (at least from a German's point of view). There it is possible for a presidential election to turn out that Gore has 200.000 votes more than Bush but because of the moronic voting system, Bush still gets to be president. Sounds very democratic to me, and I haven't even started talking about American politicians getting bought out by all of the different lobbyists and this being ACCEPTED because there is no public campaign financing.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and apart from that, isn't judging a whole linguistic area (i.e. people speaking the same language) like you do just as rassistic, bad and wrong as what Hitler promoted in his racial cleansing campaings. He wanted to 'reeducate' people that didn't like him, talking of your 'reliteracy programs'.

Indeed. But when the public votes against an EU treaty (like the Danish did with the treaty of Maastricht, and the Irish more recently with the treaty of Nice) The EU simply asks them again, repeatedly, until it gets the answer it likes.<BR><BR>
It is also highly shameful the way Turkish gastarbieters are treated, being denied citizenship, even when born in Germany, and despite Turkey being a member of the EU.<BR><BR>
Contrast this to the other EU state: Britain. <BR><BR>
Britain has an almost 'open door' policy on immigration, as anyone from Bosnia or Kurdistan will tell you. Simply arrive in the UK and claim asylum. The UK turns away almost noone.<BR><BR>
This is despite the French deliberately sending huge numbers of asylum-seekers to the UK. The British nation with its sense of fair play, and right and wrong, takes these people in, and in time grants them citizenship.<BR><BR>
Why is it that Britain (One of only three net contributors to the EU budget) is villified by other EU nations ? It seems to me as if Britain is showing the way for the other nations of the EU. Are they brave enough to follow ?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

EU treaties: The Danish got significant concessions before they agreed to Maastricht.
<BR>
Nice will be tougher, as the French (not so much the Germans) were the driving force behind the complex regulations. And, te Irish don't want to lose their subsidies, although they don't need them anymore.
<BR>

<BR>
Gastarbeiter, Turkey: Turkey is not part of the EU, only NATO. It has severe human rights 'issues'. Gastarbeiter can apply for German citizenship like every other foreigner. Since last year, their kids get it automatically.
<BR>
The discussion was about dual citizenship, which is problematic in cases of a conflict with the respective state. 
<BR>

<BR>
Britain 'villified': Thanks to Mrs. Thatcher, Britain gets huge discounts. They benefit from the EU (free market, subsidies...) but they are not willing to contribute/pay. 
<BR>
Due to their shabby politics in the BSE case (they allowed exporting infected animal feed that was illegal in the UK), the disease spread over Europe.
<BR>

<BR>
UK immigration policy: Have you seen the civil war like incidents in Oldham and Bradford on TV? Not quite a role model for immigration. Furthermore, those people are mostly from the commonwealth. The vast majority of asylum seekers and civil war victims are in Germany.
<BR>

<BR>
The reason why they are relatively open to foreigners is that they offer the least social security. They are more like the US and less like the other Euronations in this respect, so they are less attractive.

Although I think that is precisely what makes Britain so attractive for the average immigrant. Most of the asylum seekers are not in any immediate physical danger, and for the most part are what we would call economic migrants. The most dynamic of these migrants will want to go somewhere with a less socialist way of life.<BR><BR>
Think about it: If you are prepared to risk your life attempting to cross the English channel on an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1464000/1464672.stm">inflatable li-lo</a>, the last thing you want is for the government to take 60-70&#37;&#37; of your earnings in tax.<BR><BR>
Britain is indeed very much like the USA. So much so in fact that when they finally reject monetary union, there is a very, very real possibility that they may join NAFTA, and indeed eventually may become another American state. Believe me this would be a VERY popular move amoungst the youth of Britain who universally despise the EU corruptuion and socialism.<BR><BR>
We speak the same language. We have an Anglo-Saxon culture in common. We are not socialists.
Britons watch a diet of almost exclusively American TV and Movies. We listen to gangsta rap all the time and eat in McDonalds. Hell, we are 90% of the way to being fully fledged yanks. All we need are a few guns and for everyone to put on 100lbs (thats around 45KG for the euro-correct)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It has nothing to do with being merely part of Europe, and everything to do with the democratic tradition and accountability that is part of our culture and which is not part of the continental European culture. (but I expect you knew that).<BR><BR>

Whatever, you lie to yourself if you think the US would be any better than the EU. They just legalised corruption instead of fighting it (Bush campaign financing -&gt; Oil drilling in nature-sanctuaries). 
<BR>
The US are so fixated on their past and tradition that they don't realize they aren't a democracy anymore (despite the elections - remember, all eastern communist states had elections as well).
<BR>
Not to mention the irresponsible isolationism and taliban politics (read today that outlawing condoms is planned...).
<BR>
I think you'd have a much better chance fighting EU corruption (probably together with the Germans, against the French) than changing something in the insane US system...

<BR>
"we are forced to use metric measurments when the general public is perfectly happy with the existing system."

Everyone who insists on using insane measurements is a dork ;) (Besides, a pint is still a pint, and even the Pound Sterling uses the metric system for a long time). And: US gallons are different from UK gallons etc...

"Now what exactly are the much touted benefits of Europe ? "

Britain benefits most of the free market. Heck, we even had to let in that infected beef stuff for some time due to UK politicians citing free market rules!

"Why do not the Swiss join ?"
<BR>
Mostly because of their system of unique direct democracy. Business is almost unanimously in favour of joining. (Note: I used to live there.)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Britain has a long history of resisting Fascism in all its forms. Your comment about education is therefore completely wrong.

PR leads to coalition governments which aren't ever voted out, because all parties are part of the system. And with politicians being on a list, rather than being directly elected, they are answerable to the party hierarchy much more than they are the people.<BR><BR>

It does in no way remove choice for the voter. On the contrary, it provides for more choices, as in the US system it is basically useless to vote for another party than the two big ones.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Your indication that PR leads to permanent "vast coalitions" is wrong. In Germany, except for a very short period, there has never be a "big coalition" of the two big parties on the national level, and governments/coalition change much mure rapidly than you indicate (longest time: Kohl, 16y).
<BR>
As for Austria, this is correct, but for entirely different reasons.
<BR>
Part of the reason why Hitler could easily incorporate Austria into the 'Reich' was the fact the the political class was severely weakened by a civil war like conflict in the 30s where conservatives were fighting social democrats.
<BR>
After the war, the political system was built up so as to make sure this could never happen again. Every council, board of directors, public post etc was divided between conservatives and social democrats so that peace was ensured as they'd always have to work together.
<BR>
This evidently worked, but the downside was that corruption and nepotism blossomed.
<BR>
Now that there is no fear of a bloody conflict anymore, the population wanted to break up this (now corrupt) system by voting for a different party. Both the Greens and the FPOE gained votes, but unfortunately the FPOe with their charismatic leader made it into the government.
<BR>

<BR>
So, in Austria the stability was not a negative side effect of the PR system, but intentionally built into the general political system.
<BR>

<BR>
In Germany, there are usually coalitions of a big and a smaller party (Greens, liberals). The latter act as a moderator in the legislation process. That's one of the reasons why such dangerous and industry-lobbied laws like the DMCA or the RIP in the UK haven't been introduced in Germany.

<BR>

<BR>
* How can fighting for freedom and independence from the Roman Empire be "fascist culture" and "lack of independent thought". Do you say the same of the Irish and Scottish who didn't want to submit to the great British Empire...
<BR>
(By the way: not all was free. The south was under Rome's control. I live right at the Limes).
<BR>

<BR>
* The "Holy Roman Empire of German Nation" was (as my history prof said) neither holy, nor Roman (they had nothing to do with it anymore), nor German Nation, as although 'Germany' was very vague back then, Northern Italy and Sicily -both part of the Empire- weren't part of it, and the patchwork of small states were definitely not a coherent nation. What's important to note is that the emperor was elected, and that there were a lot of independent 'free cities' fostering independent thought. Compare that to France, Britain or Spain.
<BR>
And don't get me started on your Lord Protector! If there was anything like a fascist rule in Europe before the last century, it was Cromwell!
<BR>

<BR>
* Bismarck: "cruel, ambitious dictator"? 'scuse me, he was effectively an employee of the emperor and got eventually fired by him. He had to deal with the parliament, but proved to be very smart with it. He had a realistic goal (small Germany without Austria) and achieved it by the then usual means (negotiations, money, war).
<BR>
WW1 was mainly a result of bad politics after Bismarck was dismissed, technically started by Austria. After the war Germany was (one of) the first countries to introduce womens' suffrage.
<BR>

<BR>
* You forget The Weimar Republic and the Great Depression, which hit Germany hardest. Hitler was NOT voted into power, he was transferred the power through an intrigue by the old military elite. Only after the opposition had been eliminated was he able to get the majority of votes.
<BR>
You could argue there was a lack of resistance from the population against Hitler at this point of time, but as Hitler proved to be economicaly very successful, many people were satisfied.
<BR>

<BR>
* Germany today: Like late chancellor Brandt once said: "With really important questions, you never ask the people."
<BR>
Everyday politics are just fine, but when it comes to Europe, all parties agree on a pro-EU course, and don't want to ask the people...
<BR>

<BR>
We all know how the EU works: The French run the show, Britain is commenting from the sidelines and Germany pays the bills. It has worked amazingly smooth like that, and apparently our politicians want to keep it that way...
<BR>
So agreed, there was no direct referendum yet, but we don't have a direct democracy like the swiss, so we have to trust our politicians.

Some voted, not the majority. Then again, racism wasn't top of their agenda, fighting the reparations (esp. to the French) and the economic problems were. It's fair to say that the average man hated the French much more than the Jews.
<BR>
And for these goals, looking 5 years ahead, like it or not, Hitler wasn't a bad choice.

"They may be better at hiding it these days, but scratch the surface of any German and you will find a racist."
<BR>
Might be true or not. In any case, the same applies to USAmericans, or most other nations, for htat matter. Those who are or look different will always facea certain hostility, hidden or not.

What's the significance of that? They're all spelled differently which
means they are all different concepts.</i>

<BR><BR>Define "concept". And please explain why spelling (or pronunciation,
for that matter) should in any way reflect the "concept"; especially
in the face of facts like the existence of ambiguous words and cases
of multiple accepted spellings for the same word.

<BR><BR>Something to keep in mind. The father of modern linguistics,
Saussure, even went as far so as to make the opposite idea, <i>the
arbitrariness of the sign</i>, a <b>defining</b> feature of language.
He also set out as a basic theoretical principle the <i>primacy of the
spoken form of a language over the written one</i>.  By assuming the
opposite of these in your argument, you simply are parting company with
the science of linguistics; don't be surprised when the amount of
attention and seriousness people devote to your "arguments" becomes
proportionate to your adherence.

<BR><BR><i> BTW, next time try something other than present tense, you'd
notice that the pronunciations (and spelling) differ quite a bit
more.</i>

<BR><BR>Imparfait: je parlais, tu parlais, il parlait, on parlait, vous
parliez, ils parlaient.  5 homophones.
<BR><BR>Subjunctive: que je parle, que tu parles, qu'il parle, qu'on parle,
que vous parliez, qu'il parlent. 5 homophones.

<BR><BR>The verb forms in French that don't follow this pattern are archaic
(future indicative, simple past, <i>nous</i> forms which are being
ousted out of the language by <i>on</i>) or marginally productive at
best (2nd and 3rd conjugations, irregular verbs).

<BR><BR>The fact is that French, contrary to its orthography, is an isolating
language, whose verbs have for the most part 1 stem which takes very few
inflectional suffixes. This is evident if you take a standard French
conjugation table, throw out the obsolete parts, and transcribe the
forms phonologically.<BR><b>--em<br>

<BR><BR>No.  But you're not only changing languages, you're picking the most
irregular verb in English.

<BR><BR>The difference between those verb forms is the range of subjects
they may be used with. But the agreement information they provide, as
it happens, is completely redundant. And not only that, they hardly
contribute any meaning to the sentences they occur in, if they do at
all-- why do you think so many languages do without the verb "be" in
present tense copulative sentences like <i>He in school?</i> (e.g.
Russian or African-American English; actually, most languages in the
world work like this...)

<BR><BR><i>The concept is the verb and what it refers to or acts on it.</i>
<BR><BR>What do the verb forms you cite refer to?  That is, what is the
meaning of the forms of the verb "to be"?

<BR><BR><i>Parle. It sounds like I or he or you speak, but if it's written
down this way, how would you know? And how would you know what tense
he's in?</i>

<BR><BR>Duh. The only sentences in French where you could use "parle" without
an overt subject are imperative sentences.  Thus, under the assumption
what's written down is a sentence, that's a 2nd person imperative.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thanks, that was really hilarious! I know it was probably meant to be serious, but as someone with German as mother tongue that really amuses me.
<BR>

<BR>
Just let me, Nazi-by-language, as it were, add a few remarks:
<BR>

<BR>
A. What about the SWISS? They are stubbornly democratic and free minded, boasting the oldest modern democracy. And yet they are speaking German! With a heavy dialect, but still following the same grammatic rules.
<BR>
Sure, there is a minority of French and Italian-speaking people as well, but the 'German Swiss' started the whole thing. Dammit, they're cheating...
<BR>
<BR>
B. It might be helpful to look at the roots of European languages, instead of just picking random examples to build a theory on. There are Romanic and Germanic languages, the former building on Latin, the latter also called Indo-Germanic/Indo-European, as they are said to originate from India. (We'll leave out the strange cases of Finish-Hungrian, Basque and Gaelic languages for now).
<BR>
English, while Germanic, has naturally strong romanic influences (see history book).
<BR>

<BR>
C. Latin - we all loved it at school :-} is much less 'ordered' as you'd like it to be. "Omnia Gallia divisa est in partes tres" - not everyone writes as simple as Caesar. In fact, there is no mandatory order at all, you have to look at he cases, analyse the grammar etc to find out the meaning of a Latin sentence e.g. in Ciceros writing or in poetry. Some things are even intentionally left out. In any case, you have to read the sentence to the very end to understand it. This flexibility is actually very similar to German, which leads us to
<BR>

<BR>
D. You sound like a disgruntled High School student who is pissed off by how tough German is. 
<BR>
I understand you. Honestly, I'm really happy I don't have to learn it from scratch. Your German examples are pretty (*COUGH*) buggy (it's "IM Bett mit DEM HerrN"), and what's more, it is only one possibility, with many others left out (you just can't put both aux. and verb before the object).
<BR>
So agreed, it's tough, but guess what: It's really worth the hassle!
<BR>

<BR>
E. As for the logical combinations of words, maybe "Flusspferd" is a bit unfortunate because it's not a horse, but it demonstrates the point: every kid knows instantly that this creatures lives near rivers and looks (very) remotely like a horse. While in English, if you don't know the greek word hippo(potamus), you'd maybe think it's an infective desease.
<BR>
While this may sound like it's not a big deal in this case (and in fact we'd use the greek/latin counterparts in more scientific areas as well) it is extremely valuable in areas where genuinely new thoughts and concepts are to be described.
<BR>
How come the English use Zeitgeist, Wanderlust, Eigen vector etcetc...
<BR>
How come the really deep and groundbreaking works of modern philosophy were written in German (Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger), as opposed to the scietific-practical works in English (Pope, Hume, Smith) and the morally-educational entertaining 'chatter' in French (Rousseau, Voltaire)? How come they lose immensely when translated?
<BR>
I'd argue that the complexity of the language allows to express in German a superset of what's possible in other European languages (nuances...).
<BR>

<BR>
The price of it? You have to read the sentences to the very end, for sure...
<BR>

<BR>
What this has to do with Germans apparently being born Nazis?
<BR>
- Don't know. But next time I will show conclusively how the use of inversion after restricting adverbs at the beginning of an English sentence explains how the US and the US switched from supporting Saddam to fighting Iraq.

Thanks for the clarification.
<BR>

<BR>
(BTW, the first big successes of fascism were in Italy under Mussolini and Franco in Spain - until 1968! I don't think the main characteristics of these peoples are "authoritarian and bureaucratic".
<BR>
And I don't think you'd describe puritan Englishmen as "a nation of carefree, happy go lucky people" either.)
<BR>

<BR>
The point is: Peoples may well have certain characteristics. These may or may not correlate with their culture and language (I'd say geography is more important). To link these to specific incidents like Naziism is like proving Frenshmen eat snails due to their grammar - a far fetch.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

But as em is the linguistic expert, I'll at least provisionally take his word for it; at least, on his authority, I'll roll the idea around in my mind.

<BR><BR>Alas, as an Americano, I am embarrassingly monolingual (maybe you can take the boy out of Ohio, but you can't take Ohio out of the boy), so I must ask someone this.  What I would like to know, however, is if in spoken German one can get away with sentences which do not obey the customary word order, and yet still be understood by native German speakers.  (Maybe my oldest daughter, who is studying German in college, could answer that, but she's out of town visiting friends for a couple more weeks.)

<BR><BR>For example, in English, where the subject-verb-object order ordinarily prevails, one can still the German verb-last rule obey.  True, one like a foreigner sounds; readers the text into an punctilious monocle-wearing accent project.  Nevertheless one oneself understood can make.  Whereas on the other hand if one arbitrarily scrambles the order of subject-indirect object-direct object in English, a speaker will surely give his listeners a dose of confusion, as: "dose gives listener speaker" conveys something distinct than "speaker gives listener dose".

<BR>

<BR>
Yes, you could change the word order in Germand as well, and it would be just as painfully unnatural as your english examples.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, maybe I'll advance it would be more difficult. Germand verb tenses interact rather strongly with the word order. Simple present and simple past are SVO whereas most other tenses are SaOV (where 'a' stands for the auxiliary).
<BR>
Plus there are OVS orders you can use if you need to highlight something important about the object.
<BR>

<BR>
Blaming WW2 on SOV order is entertainigly far fetch. There is however a very practical effect of SOV. 
<BR>
Germands never interupt each other as they talk. They just can't, the grammar doesn't allow for it! As I hear, even flames, disputes and even heated technical discussion will operate by alternating full sentences and complete idea. Don't you wish you would see that more often? 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm sure a long time ago, the germands must have been interupting each other all the time, for them to have developed a whole grammatical defence against being cut off...

Now i'm no "patriot" (in fact, those are far fewer in Germany than in the states), and i hate to engage in writing "don't you talk about my momy"-posts. But some of the comments (and most of the original article) are just so hypocritical and clueless, it's just enfuriating. Actually, I share the notion that a language is actually telling a lot about the culture in which it is used, but the conclusions draw here are just hidious.
<BR>

<BR>
DISCLAIMER: I'm not a native english speaker, so please forgive me my spelling mistakes, even if we are taling about language here.
<BR>

<BR>
A) Nearly every single example of a german sentence in this thread is faulty, if not plain WRONG. If you want to make judgement, know the subject !
<BR>

<BR>
B) As many posters pointed out, by picking the right "examples", you can just proove about everything. F.i. there is the (AFAIN) unique rule in english to capitalize "I" and any word referring to a country, like "German". Shall I conclude from that that english-speaking people are egocentic and nationalistic ?
<BR>

<BR>
C) The German language produces obidience and strictness ?  Have you ever ben to germanny, or are you drawing you profound wisdom from a textbook (or from a TV-show by any chances) ?
<BR>
I've been living here all my live, and I had a 10 month stay in the states (Indiana) some years ago -- i went to an american highschool as an exchange student. If comparing the relation of American teenagers to their parents and teachers, in America is much more about "respect" (meaning obidiance -- true respect is based on LIKING someone) than it ever experianced it at home. In general American parents, teachers and polititians rely far more on the "because i said so"-attitude, which allways made my think if they ever read there holy Declaration of Independace or the Buill of Rights (which could be great achivements, if they were actually taken seriously).
<BR>

<BR>
D) As opposed to what the article suggested, the German language was not "designed" -- like nearly every language, it just developed. Now, that actually means it is VERY STRONGLY influencedby the culture -- but no one ever sat down and devised a language in order to make the Germans obidient, or whatever.
<BR>

<BR>
E) I personally can think of only one true "Nazi-Language": I's "Newspeak", outlined by Gerorge Orwell in the novel 1884: Its a minimal language designed in a way to make it impossible to formulate (and even think) about disobedience or individuality. So, what is good about a language is it "power" (=ability to express an idea correctly and efficiently) which is based on diversity and flexibility -- those criteria are met by pretty much every language i know of, and im very glad this is so.
<BR>

<BR>
F) Who (besides your highschool german teacher) told you that german was "logical" ?! Surtainly not a German ! English is far more "logical", when it comes to grammar. But languages like French and Russian (not to speack of Hungarian) are even far more complicated than German -- try it if you don't belive it. 
<BR>
The way compound-word are created in german is actually quite unique - but once you have figured out what words were kombined, it is easy to understand their meaning -- as opposed to the English language, were there are literally millions of special words for those things (I read figures that said the english language has about factor 10 more individual words than any other european language). Now, talking about hard to understand for outsiders !
<BR>

<BR>
OK, i could get on and on about this, but i don't want to be too frindly to my neighbours here -- i'm not a true "fan" of Germanny. So, as i pointed out in the outset, i do agree that a language may tell a lot about the people that use it. But i would concentrate on things like finding out how many words there are for a specific concept in that language: if you told me that there is a people whos language has 20 word for snow, i would know without looking that that people is living in a cold area with a lot of snow (it's actually true for the Inuit people). Besides: did you know there is no word for "freedom" in chinese ? The closest translation means something like "unlimited allowance" (please correct me if i'm wrong).
<BR>

<BR>
Furthermore, judging the characteristics of a people SOLELY by looking at their grammar is just as bad as judging someone by the color of it's skin -- it's prejustice, if not a sign of fascism.

<BR>

<BR>
lets list the bases here:
<BR>
latin (includes many western "civilised languages"
<BR>
germanic (from the tribes of the middle ages,       including the goths, norse, etc (read ur       history moron))
<BR>
asian (well duh.  to a stupid american (i.e. the        author of the article) it sounds like        babling, yet, some asian countries are far        superior technologically than the U.S.        (read: japan)
<BR>
african (sounds like a bunch o' clickin...  must        be morons... let's segregate yeah!)
<BR>
native american (more morons.  let's kill em and        take their homes...)   
<BR>

<BR>
you CAN NOT assume that persons are something without knowing them.  The germans of WWII may not have all been racist morons (like the author, who is clearly anti-germanic), many of them were easily influenced morons.

Actually, a little known fact, Elvis Presely wasn't abducted by aliens - he time traveled.  Yes, its well known what a rabid Nazi lover he was, in fact, its because of his time travelling that the German language was founded (all in an attempt to fuel the fire of Nazism and burning pale emaciated Jews alive as they screamed and cursed their God as they watched their own fat melt off them).

In short, the kinds of traits that are rampant in the US at the beginning of the 21st century (and that you could serve as a poster child for).  Let's just hope that the US economy doesn't go sour, because that is usually the trigger that causes people to act on their beliefs.

As for yourself, to cure your own nationalistic views, I recommend reading up on the history of the US and Britain from the point of view  of the (American/Asian) Indians, Chinese, Africans, Hawaiians, and Central and South Americans, people who were abducted, murdered, subjugated, terrorized, enslaved, and robbed of their lands.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">well em,
<BR>
i see u have no idea of the german language.
<BR>
first of all i noticed several grammatical mistakes in ur "examples".
<BR>
Jan hat Marie IM Bett mit DEM Herr gesehen
<BR>
IM not in DEM not der.
<BR>

<BR>
so u really seem to be a not so "skilled" german speaker, and you dare to write such "comments"
<BR>
about the german language. Did you ever read the book "Animal Farm" written by George Orwell .. well its a kind of a novel which meaning can be transfered to the real world in the WW2 era. 
<BR>
Well your "arguments" are as ridicolous
<BR>
as the ones Napoleon from Animal Fram used to say.
<BR>

<BR>
Another point. You say German is complex... i say no definetaly not as complex as for example russian(i speak russian and german very good). In Russian we have 7 clauses , in german only 4 and in english only 1 . so from your point of view german seems very complex... but from for example mine its rather simple... there are also certain asian languages which are made in a very different way. 
<BR>

<BR>
Another point. You say the rest of the world speaks latin-based languages... ever heard of a country called china, populated with over 1.000.000.000 people..speaking a non-latin-based language... �?
<BR>

<BR>
Another point. You have the example 
<BR>
(Ich habe ein Flusspferd gesehen) I've seen a riverhorse. (by the way in the new german grammar Fluss is written with a double 's' not an '�').
<BR>
you further say
<BR>
"if you tried to make a logical guess, you'd guess that it was a kind of horse,". Well id say languages are not there for that u can guess the meaning... (its not a programming language).
<BR>
and if greek "hippopotamus" means riverhorse and is made up of two greek words why is it so amazing that the germans did �the same with two analog german words...and further u say german is unoriginal... well than tell me what is more original just to take a greek word and use it as if it were english...or at least use this word translated....
<BR>

<BR>
And i just dont understand what connection there is between the language of the country and their culture.. u have no real arguments just because the adjectives you use to describe the language, can be used to describe a culture its still not a reason to do so. for example it is said that 
<BR>
french is a beautiful language... and remember napoleons war in europe and russia... wehre so �there were so many innoncent victims? on the other hand english is said to be simple, easy,good... well what about the horrible 
<BR>
slave- triangle, shipping slaves to america..throwing pregnant women overboard, because they were not strong eoungh... if u say german is bad...so why dont u think of the no1 in pollution decreasing technology, germany.
<BR>
i dont want to say that england or france is bad nor that germany is good... merely wanted to tell that the language has absolutely nothing to do with the lifestyle!
<BR>
i think im done!
<BR>
------------
<BR>
just one thing about ur own description... 
<BR>
em is an armchair anarchist, intellectual attack dog...
<BR>
a real big LOL to the intellectual attack dog... its really ridicolous what u wrote here! and far, very far away from intellectual...rather a collection of adjectives u use to describe language and culture at the same time. (a tip for the next time learn german better before u write those text ... "boss" still means "Boss" in german..."derived from latin", yeah yeah... haha!)
<BR>
and even if you write with a so complex language u still write bullshit...with no sense!
<BR>
so a real big "FUCK YOU" to you and your text.

Sorry, but if you are too lazy to learn German Grammar it really isn't our fault. And if you aren't even able to keep 5 words when you look them up in your Dictionary I'd just say you should leave learning German (or languages at all) and not say that we are 'mean' or something.
