		<B>[editor's note, by jsm]</B>  This story was a long time in the writing.  It all stems back to a <a href="./2001.12.2.42056.2147.html">a rather controversial story</a> we published here a while ago, which contained a <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/content/28/23650.html">rather controversial assertion</a> about chip maker <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/09070102.htm">AMD</a>.  Specifically, it claimed that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NXZ0/adequacy-20/">AMD</a> chips were made in sweatshops in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Third World</a>.  Naturally, we at <a href="../index.html">adequacy</a> would never print such an outrageous claim without checking it up.  Here are the results of our investigations, with only the lightest of editorial and legal cuts.        </div>    </td>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Two <a href="http://www.amd.com/">high-tech</a> <a href="http://www.intel.com">companies</a>.  Two chip production facilities.  Two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">products</a> 
regarded by most of their users as broadly interchangeable.  But between the 
<a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~meber/bunnies/">glittering, clean modern plants</a> of Intel, with their antistatic-suited, 
health-insured, unionised and <a href="http://www.wininformant.com/display.asp?ID=2891">skilled</a> workers, and the dirty, hot, 
<a href="http://www.bhopal.org/">malodorous</a> infernos of AMD, where malnourished children eke out a dangerous 
living amid the splashes of red-hot molten silicon, there is a <a href="http://www.minesofmoria.co.uk/">chasm</a> that 
spans worlds.  Very few <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org">casual computer users</a> ever realise (their <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">ignorance</a> 
helped by a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">smug, complacent industry media</a>) quite the extent of the human 
cost which goes into AMD's <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/17478.html">suspiciously budget-priced</a> chips. 
<P> 
Our investigation started on a tip-off from roving East Asian <a href="../index.html">adequacy.org</a> 
editor <a href="../users/28/index.html">Kip</a>, who began <a href="http://www.bridesbymail.com/">married life</a> in the unstable tropical paradise of 
the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0380788624/adequacy-20">South China Sea</a> last year.  Setting up house in the Philippines as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">high-priced</a> 
software mercenary, he became somewhat peturbed at the number of children he 
saw on the streets everyday, begging for food and missing fingers, thumbs or 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446530883/adequacy-20">occasionally whole limbs</a>.  Children and young women disfigured by burn 
scars, or blinded and carrying the marks of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0936876476/adequacy-20">corrosive chemical spills</a>.	Over 
time, he began to realise that a disproportionately high number of these 
casualties of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0688178057/adequacy-20">developing economy</a> were wearing polo shirts, baseball caps 
and beach shorts carrying a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">logo</a> familiar to him from his days as a high-end 
embedded systems designer in London; the logos of chip giant AMD. 
 <P>
When I got off the plane at Manila International Airport, I was met by T 
Reginald Gibbons, the contributor of the original article which had caused 
all the trouble.  Talking on the shuttle bus from the airport into town, I 
was struck by his mild manner and devout Christian belief.  Although I have, 
rather notoriously, had a few <a href="./2001.9.7.65442.28658.html">run-ins</a> with right-wing <a href="http://www.bettybowers.com">Christians</a> on the 
staff of adequacy.org, Reginald impressed me with the sincerity of his 
faith, and the intensity of his passion to expose this scandal. 
 <P>
On my second evening in Manila, after sleeping off the jet-lag, I took a 
stroll with Reginald into the area of town known as "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006712/adequacy-20">Chip Hell</a>".  This was a 
short ride by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1567301304/adequacy-20">motorcycle taxi</a> away from Reginald's comfortable white-porched 
villa on the fashionable east side of town, but it might as well have been 
the other side of the world.  A ranshackle assembly of <a href="http://www.avoncroft-farm.fsnet.co.uk/houses.htm">tin huts</a>, 
chicken-wire and <a href="http://www.restrooms.org/device-free.html">improvised drainage</a>, with pigs running loose in the 
streets, walls tied together with gaffer tape, and everywhere the stench of 
ammonia and human excrement.  Looming ominously above the shanty town were 
the two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0674006712/adequacy-20">huge</a> corrugated huts which made up AMD's main assembly plant.  This 
was the "fab" (short for "<a href="http://www.southerncrossreview.org/Ebooks/ebfavelach.html">favela</a>", from the <a href="http://www.portugal.org/">Spanish</a> for "slum"). 
 <P>
We walked on, trying to ignore the snapping of the stray dogs which roamed 
at will through the AMD fab, taking in the sights and sounds, and always the 
omnipresent reek of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0813122260/adequacy-20">toxic PCBs</a> used in chip manufacture.  A prematurely 
aged woman stood by the side of the road, with a gaggle of small children 
clustered round her ankles as she laboriously turned the handle of an 
adapted <a href="http://www.phespirit.info/derekandclive/mabel.htm">clothes-mangle</a>, while her husband balanced nearby on two 
factory-second artificial legs, his hands shaking as he poured liquidised 
window putty through a funnel onto the rollers.  The two of them were 
squeezing out motherboards -- the lowest of the low in the jungle pecking 
order of the fab.  Over the road, a young man sat, himself pinched with 
poverty, but eyeing the aged pair through his counterfeit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Oakley</a> sunglasses 
with the air of a feudal blacksmith surveying the churls in the fields.  In 
his hands, he held a pair of tin-snips and a small hammer; next to his 
roadside stool, a stak of scavenged <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Pepsi-Cola</a> cans.  With unbelievable 
manual dexterity, he took a sheet of motherboard still sticky and viscous 
from the press, slammed it flat onto an upturned steel bucket in front of 
him, and began snipping metal from a can, hammering it out flat and applying 
it to the surface of the motherboard before it cooled.	The acrid fumes 
rising up from his workbench were already <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000071QD/adequacy-20">turning his eyes yellow</a>, but 
completed motherboards would sell for US$0.60 a kilogram when the AMD 
factory cart came round in the morning, and this would provide him with 
enough money to buy ever-plentiful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004WLVS/adequacy-20">heroin</a> from the child peddlers who 
continually tugged at our coats. When he put his hammer down and started <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1583220089/adequacy-20">looking for a vein</a>, I decided I'd had enough and asked Reginald if we could return to the hotel.
<P>
The next day our work started in earnest with the first interview:<p>

<B>Maria-Consuela J</B> was a young union organiser and womens' rights <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">activist</a> nicknamed "Conchita" in Chip Hell.  She told us about the long assembly benches in the big halls, where young women sat for ten-hour shifts without so much as a bathroom break, gluing chips into motherboards.<P>

<I>"The cowhide glue is the worst part.  They make it out the back of the factory, stirring it up in big vats.  Any dead animal, or leftover bones when we have meat, they go into the glue vats.  The smell is horrible and it makes your fingers red"</I>. <P> Conchita showed us her hands; every finger had at least one red, angry blister, several of which were burst and weeping.  I was amazed at her toughness; despite the obvious physical pain, she maintained the aztlan.net workers' rights website from a scavenged <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Microsoft</a> ergonomic keyboard and a computer cobbled together from cast-off parts in the back room of a shack which served as the community centre.  Her jaw was firm and her gaze unwavering as she told us about the way in which the female workers in the motherboard hall were treated.
<P>
<I>"The supervisors are pigs.  Worse than pigs.  They demand sexual favours and make crude remarks to us all the time.  We are a very traditional Catholic country, so the women find this very shameful.  If you talk back to them they will give you the worst motherboards; the ones with bubbles in them, or with grease in the plastic.  These are harder to make the glue stick, so you end up losing money".</I><p>

<b>Guido V-R</b> was an elite worker in the heart of the fabrication plant itself.  Although this put him practically in the aristocracy of the fab, he was still left in no doubt about his status by the predominantly white senior management.<p>

<I>"I am a craftsman.  My father carved miniature religious basreliefs on the sides of cigar boxes.  I inherited his tools, and now I use them to carve the silicon chips.  But the </I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">yanquis</a><I> do not respect.  They abuse us constantly.  We spend our days making their chips, and they just shout at us.  They call us </I>"Taco"<i> and </I>"Nethack"<I>.  I do not know why.  Filipinos are not Mexicans.  They are very ignorant."</I><P>

Guido was not involved in union activity:
<P>
<I>"I do not join the union, because the craftsmen in the chip room are not allowed and I cannot lose my job; I have family to support.  But we have our own ways.  If the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">bosses</a> ride us too hard then </I>--kkzzzpt!-- (he gestured in the air with his razor-sharp chip-engraving awl)<I> a hairline scratch across twenty wafers!  When the rejects come back from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">consumers</a>, they know that we are unhappy and they lay off of us for a while"</I>.  As one might expect, Guido did not hold AMD's quality control in very high regard:  <I>"The </I>qualitores<I> are the old men, the simple ones, those who are no good for anything else.  They are only there to keep the ISO9000 people happy.  Why should I make good chips for $0.90 an hour?"</i><P>

<b>Pablo C</b> was lucky enough to be employed at the chip plant, and so was a rung above the unfortunate outworkers of the kind we had seen the day before in Chip Hell.  However, as an illiterate, unskilled manual laborer, his position was as fragile as the AMD silicon wafers themselves.  His task was to spend the day lifting the 200-pound slabs of silicon from the quarry wagons, then pounding them into fine powder and finally tipping this powder into the furnaces which would smelt it into the molded wafers which formed the raw material for Guido.  We saw him at work; the conditions were appalling beyond my ability to describe.  Working shifts of up to 20 hours when conditions in the global SDRAM market demanded it, Pablo was forced to the heights of physical exertion, all the time inhaling the choking silicon dust and braving the fumes and satanic heat of the blast furnaces which gave Chip Hell its name. <P>

<I>"Every day I get weaker.  The dust burns my lungs until I cannot breathe.  The heat makes me feel that I am dying.  I need to stop and rest, but if I stop, the furnace will stop and I will not be paid.  My eyes are scratched by the smoke and the fumes.  I feel my muscles start to fail.  Soon I will be too weak to work on the quarry line and my place will be taken by one of the younger boys.  I am old now.  I am 24 and I am the oldest man on the line.  Soon I will be unable to work, and I will join the pourers and pressers of motherboard resin."</I><p>

We were shocked by this.  I had estimated Pablo's age to be 45 at least.  His breathing was clearly giving him trouble, and we tried to get medical attention for him, but the meagre clinic with which AMD supplied Chip Hell did not have the scanner he needed.  Pablo refused our offer of a trip to a hospital in Manila; he seemed convinced that a popular local remedy of pounded tree bark would cure his advanced silicosis.  We saw no hope in the favela for him.<p>

<HR><P>

Back in the USA, I spoke to Gordon Moore, chief executive of the American Microprocessing Devices Corporation, an industry body dedicated to lobbying Congress for a level playing field between domestic high-end chip manufacturers and the cut-price Asian operators.  He gave us some industry context for the domestic economic consequences of Chip Hell:<P>

<I>"Well, what you've got to understand is that AMD are producing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">low-quality, cut-price</a> product, of the kind that it's difficult for us to compete with, because we have respect, for our customers and our employees, and that means that we just can't run the kind of operation they do.  AMD basically make chips which are about four years behind our technology here in the USA, like 200KHZ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Pentiums</a>, but then they 'overclock' them, which is kind of like turning the dial back on a car, and sell them over here as 1GhZ <a href"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">Pentium Pros</a>.  And we're saying to the government that, hey, that isn't right.  And so far, they'd rather preserve their globalisation and their GATT Treaty than safeguard American workers' jobs.  It's a outrage."</I><P>

It is not the place of mere weblogs like adequacy.org to comment on important matters of international economy and diplomacy.  And, in this post 9/11 climate, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the case for or against globalization.  But, as Mr. Moore points out, the AMD policy of raiding the market with its "overclocked" chips, directed squarely toward the lucrative teenage "hacker" and "Linux" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312271921/adequacy-20/">market</a>, is bad for the American chip industry.  And in Manila, I saw the human consequences of this company's manufacturing practices for myself.  When I looked into <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/ContactAMD/0,,238_249,00.html">Chip Hell</a>.

<BR>

<BR>
My only question is 'how does this website expect to get taken seriously?' This is just another alternative-perspective site that asks to me, a small-c conservative-sceptic, to 'think outside the box' by stuffing me into their 'box;' i.e., by offerring me obviously biased, left-wing polemics against "BIG EVIL," be it government, business, or whatever.  
<BR>

<BR>
The person below posted:
<BR>

<BR>
"that I expect from Adequacy.org. Hard-hitting, uncompromising, and with no "spin" whatsoever."
<BR>

<BR>
You call that unconfirmed, unsourced libel-safari into Asia "hard-hitting journalism?"  Do you really think that *linking every fourth word or phrase* to a novel on amazon.com is called research, or confirming your sources?  Superficially, the links make it look like they done they're homework, but to me it's 
<BR>
mere polish.
<BR>

<BR>
"It would be interesting to get some reactions from people who own AMD-based machines..."
<BR>

<BR>
I didn't react as an AMD-owner, but as rational, intelligent person, who just wants to speak out on drivel, to prevent it from further dumbing down on-going debate in society.
<BR>

<BR>
"are they proud of the slavery and environmental rape that they are directly funding?"
<BR>

<BR>
Before you accuse me and thousands of other people of being accessories-after-the-fact to international crimes, why don't we ask someone else *other than* adequecy.org?
<BR>

<BR>
"However, since these machines have a maximum uptime of 20 minutes or so before they overheat and must be shut down, I doubt that we will hear much."
<BR>

<BR>
Pardon?  You must be confused.  I understand that pentium4s internally under-cloak themselves by 50% if they exceed temperature tolerances. Is that what you are talking about?   
<BR>

<BR>
"Thanks for an interesting read. I've never been prouder to be an Intel owner."
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not touching that.
<BR>

<BR>
Sites like adequecy.org practice sensationalism because they can't particpate in serious debates about social-political issues, and they can't participate because their ideas are convincing only to themselves.  Dissing AMD with a contrived, 'from-the-font-lines' expose probably achieved nothing but further alienating people like me. That article was biased to the point of being crass. It's libelous bunk trying to pass itself off as journalism-verite.

Uh...  I've run on my AMD chip for 25 days strait without it crashing or restarting.  The only reason it shutdown was because the power when out in my house.  The 20 min uptime is probably because of the shitty Macroshit Winblows you are running.  Get Win2k and your crashing problems will dissappear.

The reason AMD chips are cheaper is not because they use child labour in 3rd world countries.  They are trying to steal some of the market share away from intel which they are doing by makeing better products at lower prices.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Geez... To try to even begin to reply to this guy is infuriating. OK, to start, I have been an AMD customer for 7 years. I have owned an AMD K-5, K6-2, and currently have an Athlon. AMD processors are the most stable, reliable, and best-performing chips I have ever used in my entire life. They beat out Intel chips in every area possible. I wouldn't switch to an Intel chip if you paid me.
<BR>
Oh, and by the way: AMD makes CPU's and endorses chipsets... They don't make motherboards or SDRAM. And if any glue were used on motherboards (it's not) it would be made out of polymers, not animal parts (how on EARTH would that make glue???).
<BR>
And to further enlighten you: AMD's plants are in several different countries, and they are high-tech development facilities, not sweatshops. Chips can't be made by children; you need experienced technicians with complex, expensive equipment.
<BR>
I can't believe a site that is as full of crap as this one even exists on the Internet. You people obviously have no life and do nothing except be paranoid and put companies down 24/7. It also surprises me that someone hasn't hacked this site yet... I bet if articles like these continue it will soon ;). I look forward to more of these articles so I can laugh again and we can all prove you wrong again.

MacOSX has a Unix core, not Linux.  All flavors of Windows NT (Past 3.51, which means Win2k and XP as well) have bits of code borrowed from Linux, but nothing really big.  EG:  Winsock, originally developed by a third party, was made based on BSD Linux's Sockets functionality, and there would be no consumer internet without it.  Microsoft bought that to put into NT.

<BR>

<BR>
You seem to be implying that I think that OSX is a Linux distribution.  Anyone can see this is not the case.  OSX is based on Linux in the sense that it took what Linux was and made it better by far.  
<BR>

<BR>
The first thing that they did was replace X11 with a user friendly GUI (Graphical User Interface).  Then they improved the sound support for the best latencies available under any operating system.  And thirdly they added opengl support so that the OSX updated version of Linux could support fast paced games.
<BR>

<BR>
OSX is not the same thing as "old school" Linux even though it is based on the Linux "kernel."  You can actually still get the old versions of Linux.  There are still a few people who use "old school" Linux for print servers but most people prefer the modern OSX from Apple.
<BR>

<BR>
Another thing that you are confusing is the "marketoid" vs the "developer" information.  Of course the marketting division is not going to talk about Linux because they want to differentiate themselves from the "old school" Linux.  
<BR>

<BR>
For future reference, one way you can tell developer information from information meant for ordinairy users is the number of images on the web page.  The Linux web page had no images and is clearly meant for developers only.  The other web page had lots of images and is only meant for new users.

<BR><BR>I'm not gonna go into versions but yes you still can get older version of linux like 2.2 instead of 2.4.  Older versions doesn't mean they are handicapped.  Linux can be geared.  There are print servers, mail servers, etc which used stripped down version of the linux kernel.

<BR><BR><b>Of course the marketting division is not going to talk about Linux because they want to differentiate themselves from the "old school" Linux.</b>

<BR><BR>If you are going to type stupid shit don't bother.  There is no such thing as "old school" linux as linux is a kernel.  Kind of like Kernel32 or NTkernel in Windows.  I can make a distro and make it look just a pretty as MacOSX.  Much of MacOSX is taken from the development of NeXTStep which Apple acquired from Steve Jobs when he left and formed a new OS company.

<BR><BR>Compare the history of NeXT to the history of Linux.  Which has been around longer?  Which has been more popular (popular enough for companies like Apple to take notice.  Why don't you head over to FreeBSD.org and announce how MacOSX is based on Linux and not FreeBSD.  Watch how fast their developers (which work on the open source kernel along side Apple) get pissed off.  I'll be laughing when they attack the shit out of box.  Why don't you compare the Darwin source code to that of FreeBSD and Linux.  Which one does it resemble more?

<BR><BR><b>The Linux web page had no images and is clearly meant for developers only.</b>

<BR><BR>And what Linux website would that be as there is no official site for linux?  Would it be Linux.org?  Maybe you mean Linux.com?  gnu.org and fsf.org are NOT linux websites.  The only reason they don't have a bunch of pictures is so that they load quickly.

<BR><BR>That would make more sense if BSD and OSX were linux.  You can't call OSX "old school linux" if it doesn't use linux.  And FreeBSD is not linux either.  FreeBSD is older than linux.

Linux is one of a number of Unix-like OSes.  It is not a gerenric term used to describe them all.  There are other Unix-like OSes.  Most of them are not under the GPL.  Some examples of non-linux open source OSes

So let me get this straight.  Linux is NOT a [now] 16MB kernel created by Linux Torvalds and presented to the world in 1991?  It is some political ideology?  So in other words you are claiming that it <i>is</i> nothing more than a generic term used to describe free open source software?  Man are you stupid.

<BR><BR>The simple fact that you sit there and talk about BSD linux is idiotic.  Hello, BSD and FreeBSD are <i>MUCH</i> older than linux.  Linux <i>is</i> a technology.  What amazes me more is that linux was available on the public domain for quite sometime <i>before</i> Linus Torvalds put it under the GNU GPL (which has been around almost as long as the Free Software Foundation, 1985).

<BR><BR>Open source software is as <i>much</i> older than linux.  I suggest you do a little research into history.  You might find that that most of the first software <i>was</i> OSS.  You might also find that the US government fostered open source, open source, and open licenses for years until it began consentrating on other things like pathetic cold bullshit during the mid 80s and into the 90s.  Now I'm not saying it was all bullshit.  But investigated someone because the wore a Red Shirt!?!

<BR><BR><a href="http://www.netaction.org/opensrc/future/">Here</a>'s a really good resource.  Oh and just in case you wanna go off on some pathetic rant about hacked links, you can read the book in its entirety this Fall when it's published by Penn State Press.

<BR><BR>One more thing, LUnix is not to be confused with linux.  LUnix is LittleUnix for the c64/128 and other 8bit computers.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Bruce, let me ask you a question.  Have you ever BEEN anywhere where they run sweatshops, or do you just read about them on anti-globalization web pages?
<BR><BR>
Go to Manila sometime.  The smell alone is an experience.  Better still, go to Guangzhou (aka Canton) the big city on the Pearl River Delta.  Take a walk around the train station.  Every day, several thousand people get off the train.  The folks from the countryside you can spot in a heartbeat.  They're shoddily dressed, they're skinny, and they have a look of absolute despair on their face.  This is not the "I'm having a bad hair day" look.  This is what happens when pretty much every day since you were born was a bad hair day, and things ain't looking up soon.  This face will etch itself into your memory forever.
<BR><BR>
These people stand on the street with signs made of cardboard or scrap wood which say "Zao1 Yuan2 Gong1" (looking for work).  These guys know what sweatshop jobs are about.  That's why they came here.
<BR><BR>
Now all this description and detail is to drive a point home.  Tell me why these people keep coming off the train, hundreds every day, day in, day out.  Tell me why the university-educated men and women I met in Manila dream about getting a job as a maid in Hong Kong or Taipei for the princely sum of $450/month.  Explain why these people don't just stay in their happy pastoral farm villages and I'll hear you out on sweatshop conditions.

Yes I have been to Manila.  I haven't been to Guangzhou, but I've been to Shenyang and seen the signs you describe.  I've also been to Bangkok and some places in Indonesia.

Yes indeed, many people would rather seek work in an Asian city than remain in the Asian countryside.  This is a similar phenomenon to what happened in England during the industrial revolution.  A key difference is that England was profiting handsomely from its empire.
<BR>

<BR>
Today, of course, that empire is gone, but Western countries still profit mightily from the imbalance between labour costs in developed countries and those in less developed countries.  I can buy a nice shirt with what I earn in two hours.  I am happy to pay what I earn in three hours, if the extra 50% went to the people who made the shirt.
<BR>

<BR>
If we in the West paid fairer prices for our consumer goods, workers could - I said could, not would - be more fairly paid.
<BR>

<BR>
Then the internal immigrants you allude to could pursue a better future, rather than just a dream.

<i>A key difference is that England was profiting handsomely from its empire.</i>
<BR><BR>
Sorry to get pedantic on you sir, but certain <i>people</i> in England were profiting handsomely off the labor of the peasants, just as certain people in China/Indonesia/the Philipines profit handsomely off the laborers there.  The people toiling in the shops didn't get much of the benefit in England either.
<BR><BR>
<i>Today, of course, that empire is gone,</i>
<BR><BR>
It is?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  The West has technical expertise, capital, and of course, access to markets.  The Empire is very much alive and well, it's just that the control mechanisms are a little more subtle thant the old days.
<BR><BR>
<i>but Western countries still profit mightily from the imbalance between labour costs in developed countries and those in less developed countries.</i><BR><BR>
See above.  If you're resentful, take some of your paycheck and buy Nike shares.  It's again, more efficient than the old days when a few old farts in London had access to all the profits and didn't share at all.
<BR><BR>
That's a slightly flippant response, so I'll address your main point.  If you feel guilty about buying stuff made in sweatshops, don't buy it.  I will happily introduce you to a nice tailor who will only oppresses laborers in the United States.  If you'd like to benefit the devloping world at the same time, you can go to my tailor in Taipei as well.
<BR><BR>
I'm sorry if this is not working towards your ideas of social justice.  Social justice just doesn't work very well with modern capitalism.  
<BR><BR>
Nike (to take a most odiferous example) has a responsibility to their shareholders to maximize their profit.  Period.  Failure on the part of Nike's officers to be mindful of this will result in their removal at minimum, and potentially lawsuits against their persons for breach of fiduciary responsbility.  If the fact that Nike (or more correctly, Nike's Taiwanese subcontracting company) runs appalling factories starts to eat into their market share, then and only then will there be ANY action on the part of the officers of the corporation to clean up their collective acts.
<BR><BR>
Since you've been on the tour of the miserable bits of Asia, have you been to any of the nicer ones?  Taiwan and Japan used to both be big sources of cheap labor.  Today, the younger generation in both countries would sooner die than work on a factory floor.  Education and rising expectations means that you can probably get a nice job in an air-conditioned office rather than breaking your back like the old man did.
<BR><BR>
I don't like sounding like a blithering libertarian.  I'm not.  Unfortunately, all those poor hicks coming off the train each day are going to be a terrible counterweight to any hope of getting reasonable labor laws enacted.  China (to use the example which I am most familiar with), is under intense perceived political pressue to deliver jobs.  Forcing improved labor conditions will not create more jobs.  (How many jobs would or would not be eliminated if labor conditions improved is subject to debate, but if you're a local party boss, such intellectual fine points may be lost somewhere).
<BR><BR>
You are willing to pay half again as much for a shirt.  Go ahead and do that.  I agree with you, and do my best to buy goods that come from somewhere besides the lowest bidder.  It's nice to be in the top 20% of our great Republic's socioeconomic ladder and have money to spend on the frivolities of life like nice stuff rather than focusing on the boring crap like keeping the landlord paid and keeping the credit card whacked down somewhere out of the "red line" zone.  I'll go talk to the nice lady who works for $8/hour down at the local daycare and see if I can get her on board with this program.  Wish me luck!

We seem to be getting on so well, so now I'm going to spoil it!
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Social justice just doesn't work very well with modern capitalism. 
<BR>

<BR>
There, that's it!  That's the problem. Capitalism *needs* inequality to survive.  But the gap between rich and poor is too wide in most countries - the disparities do not reflect the true value of people's effort or talent.  I'm not saying we should all be on the same hourly rate, merely that having individuals paid USD$40 M/year while other citizens of the same country are paid USD$15 k/year is obscene.
<BR>

<BR>
On a global scale it's even worse.  Most of the people alive today will not earn more than USD$15k *in their entire lifetimes* (in today's USDs) unless something happens to narrow the gap.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, some people say that's OK, bad luck.  I have nothing to say that could influence them, just as they could not possibly convince me that their absurd point of view is valid.  But for those of us who do acknowledge global inequity as an important issue, the question of what to do about it can be overwhelming.  But buying a shirt at a fair price feels like the right sort of thing to do for a start.
<BR>

<BR>
The trickle-down effect seems to be as elusive as the invisible handjob.  Change for the better can only come from people acting together, just as it always has.
<BR>

Nice to have met you, j

Together with Linux, it gives me all the computing power I need, for an affordable price. The uptime of the machine is 24 days now, from the last time I was tinkering with hardware and had to shutdown it. No spontaneous reboots that wouldn't be caused by power blackouts (which, if it will get annoying enough, will be addressed by a UPS unit). The only problems I ever had with it were with smbfs filesystem, and even that only when talking with Windows machines, so I suspect some of the oh-so-usual intentional little incompatiBILLities.
<BR><BR>
I am just migrating users from one LAN to another, moving their mailboxes and machines, and having all sorts of problems. When I needed to move an user from Linux machine to another Linux machine, it was "tar -czf", then "scp", then "tar -xzf", and voila - it was done. With Windows? You first have to find where the bloody files are. Then you have to copy them away. Then you have to import them. And kiss your hopes goodbye if it is older machine that runs Outlook Express 4 which doesn't do imports. OE5 does imports from various formats but no exports to anything sane. WHAT THE HELL WAS EVER WRONG WITH UNIX MAILBOX FORMAT THAT BILLY "THE SCUM" GATES DECIDED HE HAS TO INVENT SOMETHING NEW???
<BR><BR>
But it is enough of material for a whole diary entry so I will shut up now and then summarize my experiences when the job will be done...

I am a IT-everything in a fast-growing company. I got my share of Windows-related problems. (I got my share of Linux-related problems as well, from when I pushed through the abandonment of NT platform for the servers, but they were just minor grievances in comparison with the daily annoyances of Windoze. Both Linux and Windows are a pile of shit, but Linux at least holds in the shape I put it to, while when I want Windows to keep shape I have to run around with spatula. But as I said earlier, it is enough material for a whole separate topic.)

First, tightly adhere to fully disclosed, open standards. Philosophy that the Net itself is built on.

Billy is coming after us all (or more accurately, our money and our mental health). It's pretty late now, but he still can lose. He pissed enough people by now; he will have to face tremendous firepower sooner or later - the sooner the better.

<i>Dont you have any weapons to polish, you crank?</i>
<BR><BR>
The guns are already oiled, checked, and loaded. Their matte black finish doesn't require polishing; chrome is for showoffs. The bullets are coated with teflon and their cores are made of depleted uranium. The mines are laid and armed and every alternate access path is boobytrapped. It's time for a coffee break.

Crank today, fighter tomorrow. Watch out what you are saying now; you could happen to find yourself at the wrong side of the barrel.

Having to cope with the brain-deadness of Microsoft ...ahem... products is enough on its own.

<BR><BR>
What about... freedom of not having to "upgrade" each year or two only to be able to read files someone other sends to you? Freedom of not having to invest to new hardware when the old one together with the old software does everything I want it to - except opening the "new and innovative" file formats - even between different versions of the same software? Freedom to use any operating system you want on any hardware you want and still be able to communicate with the rest of the world?
<BR><BR>
Remember - by sending me a document in proprietary file format, or forcing me to communicate in proprietary protocol, you are infringing on my freedom and I will defend myself - legally or not.

Sigh, use antiword or pdftotext, thank them, and kindly ask them to send it in plaintext (preferably), HTML, or rtf next time.
<BR><BR>
The ones that use proprietary formats are just misguided users and have chance to straighten their ways; technically, the only thing necessary to straighten their ways would be changing file format defaults. (Anyone knows how to tell Word to operate in RTF by default??? I don't care if it requires illegal and unlicenced editing of a program's binary, I just want it to do so!)
<BR><BR>
However, the ones that claim that proprietary formats are the Right And Only Way To Do Things, and actively help their proliferation, deserve to be shot at dawn.

You don't know me, but I know you. Your kind like to talk a lot about shooting people at dawn, about laying land mines, the 'matte black finish' on your weapons. Well, I haven't just talked about those things, I've lived them, and I can see right through your type.

It might be 98, I am not sure and I don't know how to find out. Regardless, from now on I plan to encourage the few people I come into contact with to do everything they can to turn to Microsoft for their every computing need. I want them to think of Microsoft and nothing else any time their minds turn to computers. In doing that I will 'actively help their proliferation', so I invite you out to my farm so that you can try to carry out your death threat. I'm in Sullivan county, PA. Just stop someone along the road and tell them that you are in town to see a man about a rifle, I'm sure they will send you my way.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

Hey - everyone should have the right to daydream!
<BR><BR>
<i>In your last few posts you have alluded to killing people a number of times, you have made mention of DU ammunition that you don't actually have that fits rifles you don't actually own,</i>
<BR><BR>
Figurative speech. I like it.
<BR><BR>
<i>and you have shown quite a bit of hostility to a group of people who are just trying to help you out.</i>
<BR><BR>
American way of help. Genuinely well-meant, but not allowing any discussions if it is wanted or necessary, and more often than not badly implemented. :(
<BR><BR>
<i>You don't know me, but I know you. Your kind like to talk a lot about shooting people at dawn, about laying land mines, the 'matte black finish' on your weapons.</i>
<BR><BR>
Still better than 24-carat gold finish.
<BR><BR>
<i>Well, I haven't just talked about those things, I've lived them, and I can see right through your type. If you were in my charge and you referred to the 'matte black finish' on a weapon, you'd march with it held over your head until you passed out. I am what your imagination wants you to be.</i>
<BR><BR>
Not accurately. All I <i>really</i> want to be is a technician being in charge of technology I can trust, in a dimly lit room air-conditioned to 75 degrees F and with unlimited supplies of Chinese green tea. My gun knowledge is fragmented and practical experiences limited to about two hours on a shooting range (though the comments about my skills were generally favorable; I should repeat it sometimes). But still enough to keep up when a "gun nut" starts talking shop; even if I then interrupt often with questions.
<BR><BR>
<i>Heres my deal: Prior to your posts I really didn't care about any of this technology dreck. I have a PC in my home, I think it runs Windows 95. It might be 98, I am not sure and I don't know how to find out.</i>
<BR><BR>
Click on start menu. If it is 98, there will be a blue bar on the left side of the menu. If there is "Windows 98" on the bar, it isn't 95.
<BR><BR> 
<i>Regardless, from now on I plan to encourage the few people I come into contact with to do everything they can to turn to Microsoft for their every computing need. I want them to think of Microsoft and nothing else any time their minds turn to computers. In doing that I will 'actively help their proliferation', so I invite you out to my farm so that you can try to carry out your death threat.</i>
<BR><BR>
I hope you will be their tech support. I hope they will have the number of your pager, cellphone, or they will possess any other means of realtime 24/7 access to you. I hope they will have many "early adopter" friends who will mail them alot of documents in too new - and therefore incompatible anymore with their software versions - formats. I also hope that at least some of them are tinkerers who like to download new software and play with system settings, if possible with Regedit itself. It will be juicier than just killing you. Shame I am too far away to watch...
<BR><BR>
<i>I'm in Sullivan county, PA. Just stop someone along the road and tell them that you are in town to see a man about a rifle, I'm sure they will send you my way.</i>
<BR><BR>
You pay for the flight (transatlantic)? I will most likely lose in the resulting shootout - but at least I will never have to deal anymore with that abysmal pile of half-baked code called Windows 95/98/NT/2000...

MS's software is extremely overpriced. I can't afford to upgrade from Windows 98 to any other OS, (except Linux, which I run alongside Win98).

I suppose the best thing I can say about MS is that their freeware , such as Media Player (version 6, that is), MSN Messenger (again, previous version) is fairly good, and their mice and keyboards, while pricey, are top-notch.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Can. Mediocrity and incompatibility are the cornerstones of their business strategy. Which is the primary reason I consider them the scummiest scum of computer industry.
<BR><BR>
<i>If you don't like it, use something else.</i>
<BR><BR>
Doing so whenever I can. But occassionally receiving an email with an attachment, and then the rodeo begins. Luckily, Antiword is usually enough...
<BR><BR>
It gets worse sometimes, when there is a mishap in one of the offices and MS software refuses to operate with MS file format - which happens with mind-numbing regularity.
<BR><BR>
<i>If Britney Spears puts out a shitty CD, do you bitch and complain about the music being bad, but still buy/pirate it?</i>
<BR><BR>
Wrong analogy. I never ran into a situation when I would be forced to listen to bad music when I want something (well, except waiting on the phone).
<BR><BR>
<i>No, if you dislike the music so much, you don't buy the CD.</i>
<BR><BR>
Right. And the only sort of incompatibility I risk is not getting some Britney-music-related jokes. Which is the risk I will gladly take.
<BR><BR>
<i>What makes you think you have the right to expect Y in product X?</i>
<BR><BR>
Common sense? Experiences from the past, that prove that what I want is logical and possible? Vain idealism and hope?
<BR><BR>
<i>I'd really love to know what fundamental right you think is being violated.</i>
<BR><BR>
The freedom of choice? The chance of doing real work instead of fighting the battles that wouldn't happen if common sense would have more weight in the world of IT than mere <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">greed and lust for power</a>?
<BR><BR>
<i>Don't go throwing around the "f" word like so much confetti.</i>
<BR><BR>
Judging from your claims, you seem to be just a mere end user who never tried anything else. Who maybe even doesn't remember the time when there were also Ami Pro, Word Perfect, Chiwriter, and a plenty of other editors, and no "common standard", and it was usual to have import/export features that actually worked well. The file formats tended to not be overly complicated (ie, Ami Pro was technically plaintext, Chiwriter as well) and in the worst case, you had the chance to look to the file on binary level and see what's in there. (You still can, even with Word, but it's awfully messy - especially when the "QuickSave" misfeature is used.) 
<BR><BR>
Another very important issue is crash recovery; with a simple plaintext-based file format you can recover at least parts of your work, even in case of catastrophical crash. But what can you do when all you are told is "Cannot open file."??? In the pre-MS times recoveries were generally easier...
<BR><BR>
Guessing from your apparent lack of hands-on experiences (or maybe you just hide them well for the purpose of being adequately <a href="../index.html">adequate</a>) it's unlikely you will (or will want to) understand what I mean. :(

Windows 2000 crashed on me. Several times.
<BR><BR>
<i>Lunix crashes. X seizes with regularity.</i>
<BR><BR>
Not only X; but the problems with smbfs I have aren't frequent enough to be more than very slightly annoying.
<BR><BR>
I mostly avoid X, commandline and terminal are enough for most things.
<BR><BR>
<i>The seizures are so comprehensive they require a reboot.</i>
<BR><BR>
Happened to me in Linux, but only few times and only on some machines. The ones I run as servers without smbfs nor X are reliable.
<BR><BR>
Plus, after the reboot Linux works well again. Just now I have a machine with Windows 2000 that reboots after reaching certain point in bootup sequence. I gave up yesterday on-site and took the machine home and wrote off the weekend. A friend specialist whom I consulted said, "Bad luck. This is not Linux. Welcome in Microsoft World."
<BR><BR>
<i>Windows2000 has never crashed on me. Incidentally, Windows2000 has never crashed on me.</i>
<BR><BR>
You are repeating yourself. So I will repeat myself too. Windows 2000 crashed on me. Repeatedly. Not really very often but enough to not consider them 100% reliable.
<BR><BR>
<i>Windows95/98/ME has, but it is disningenuous to compare the so called reliability of do nothing Lunix to those versions of Windows; it is much, much more appropriate to compare according to functionality.</i>
<BR><BR>
"Do-nothing Linux"? So why my company runs its critical infrastructure on Linux and only the desktops on Windoze, and even then one facility extensively experiments with replacing them with KDE?
<BR><BR>
And yes, Windows 98 aren't exactly good thing; memory protection is weak - after all, it's still nothing more than glorified DOS.
<BR><BR>
<i>To that end, MS-DOS has never crashed on me either.</i>
<BR><BR>
MSDOS crashed on me as well. But I hadn't met a thing that wouldn't crash on me after a while of playing with. Memory protection of MSDOS (real-mode) is nonexistent so crashes are common.
<BR><BR>
In summary, when it comes to crash recovery, I will take Linux over any version of Windows anytimes. Experienced both.

If you take the time to peruse Intel documentation, triggering faults in protected mode is a safety *feature* of modern processor design and professional software engineers differ from Lunatix in their ability to employ all documented chip features as well as undocumented features which are purposefully hidden from hackers for their own good, on the off chance they'll accidentally stumble upon an understanding of those features (remember the cracker motto: "Computers are too <i>hard</i> for normal people." This is a clear case of Freudian projection; for how can an abnormal disgraceful lot to humanity divine the thoughts of normal people? Correct, they cannot, so they compensate by imputing a personal failure onto their superiors. QED, computers are too hard for <i>crackers</i>.)

<BR><BR>
 The bright side, of course, is that you will soon be rotting on death row, free at last from evil Billy Gates and his pernicious Mind Control OS that suggests you kill everyone who disagrees with your Lunix fantasies of world domination.
<BR><BR>
I will miss your death threats. I find them a refreshing change from banal, technically factual  discussion.

You are certainly welcome to associate with birds of your feather, and Microsoft is grateful at not having to absorb the economic (and social!) cost of a pirated copy of their intellectual property. Good karma all around, I'd say.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
An exception is a safety feature on a processor.  They, are a form of interrupt handler, but are a special form of interrupt.  They are called by the OS when a problem occurs with memory, DMA, core settings, etc.  Most of them have a default action, or some generalized action determined by the OS (read: General Protection Fault, or Exception 0x0D (13)).  
<BR>

<BR>
Calling an exception 13, for the OS is equivalent to halting the system.  It usually provides as much information to the user as possible without getting in the way of a speedy shotdown (ie: most common occurence is a large-scale memory dump using x86 opcodes wherever possible and absolutely no 80386 protected opcodes).
<BR>

<BR>
For an OS to call and exception 13, every single error-trapping mechanism has to fail first.
<BR>

<BR>
What this means is, if your computer GPFs out (crashes), someone got lazy when it comes to writing error traps, and system stability suffered as a result.
<BR>

<BR>
The reason Linux crashes less often than, say, Win2k, is that everything goes through at LEAST 4 layers of error trapping, as opposed to Windows' 2.  
<BR>

<BR>
Linux Layer 1 - Software:  The open-source community tends to ensure that every conceivable error is trapped.  You have many people working on the same project, all from different levels and areas of experience and knowledge.  Damn near everything gets trapped at this level.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux Layer 2 - Object:  Many errors are auto-trapped at this level and passed back to software.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux Layer 3 - Kernel Module: If anything gets past Layers 1 and 2, the active Kernel modules that are called by the software double-check any memory areas that the program is telling them to access with the kernel.  If anything is not kosher, the mod will report it to the program.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux Layer 4 - Kernel Memory Protection:  The kernel will attempt to trap and isolate processes that cause problems.  EG: if a program tries to access a memory area outside of it's allocated space (think of it as juristiction), the kernel immediately kills it and reports an error.  Crash averted.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows only has two of these layers.  Software and Kernel.  DLLs (the equivalent of objects)  and drivers (Module equivalent) only do self-error checking.  They will work with anything passed to them without thinking about it.  If the software designer doesn't take that into account and take care of ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING, you can cause anything from memory leaks (decreasing system performance) to full-on crashes.
<BR>

<BR>
This is more frequent than microsoft would have you know.  About 30% of all commercial Win32 programs don't completely clean up after themselves.  
<BR>
Adobe Acrobat, for example, leaves a 25k stub in memory after every run.  What's in it you ask?  Old window handles, from all I can tell.  
<BR>

<BR>
Microsoft Word is a particularly bad offender here.  Once run, MS Word will slowly leech about 3k of kernel memory every minute until closed.  After that, about 15% of that memory stays allocated to a process that no longer exists.
<BR>

<BR>
Have you ever wondered why it's usually a good idea to reboot your Win32 comp every other day or so?  Now you know.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Your "fact" was empirically verified as false claim.
<BR><BR>
<i>Accordingly, I stopped reading after the quoted bit.</i>
<BR><BR>
Ostrich way of reasoning?
<BR><BR>
<i>Notice I didnt even have to mention Lunix's usability defecit. I did not have to mention that Lunix is less user friendly than any other server OS in extant.</i>
<BR><BR>
Server OS doesn't have to pander to users. If you can't afford more than a run-of-the-mill MCSEs who can't think further than the length of their mouse cable, then it could be a factor; otherwise consider any of unixoid brands instead. If you plan to run more than 1 machine, you will get reduced cost of ownership in both short and long term.
<BR><BR>
<i>That means it is thermodynamically ineffecient, performing less work per joule of human effort than *any* other OS in extant, server or desktop.</i>
<BR><BR>
Heh. So why I spend much more time per machine with wiping off the asses of Windows machines that apparently can't keep their configuration? Why the only problems with Linux machines I had were either related to power supply (and solved with an UPS), or to dying daemons (rare, and solved by daemonwatch)? Why most of my server problems can be solved remotely without having to waste a hour on the way to the office (another factor to consider)? The increased costs of learning the system are by far overweighted by the considerable savings on maintenance and increase in reliability.
<BR><BR>
When concerning the cost of learning a system, keep in mind that it's one-time investment, the same for one machine as for one hundred of machines. This way, an apparent loss can easily translate to a longterm gain.
<BR><BR>
<i>The importance of this metric cannot be understimated; I remind you that computers are meant to reduce human labor. Nothing else matters.</i>
<BR><BR>
So I run Linux (and consider learning BSD). Despite the amount of time spent learning, the per-machine labor requirements dropped dramatically at least for the servers.

Repeat, I did not want to mention Lunix's usability defecit, but now that you brought it up, I find it odd that you should make my points for me. Obviously if Lunix is frustrating -- and crash prone, hard to use software is certainly frustrating -- it's not going to be worth using, is it?

A friend of mine runs 3 boxes - one on Win2K, one on Linux, one on FreeBSD. The conclusion I have come to is that neither is better in general than the others, but the Linux and FreeBSD boxes did have much longer uptimes, despite the fact that they were performing just as many tasks at a given time as the Win2K box.
<BR>

<BR>
I also use computers at this University that dual-boot Windows 2000 and RedHat Linux 6.1. I frequently both of these OS's. Win2K crashes at least ONCE each time I use it for more than an hour at a time. Linux has NEVER crashed during the same time.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, the only way I was able to crash my installation of Linux at home was by incorrectly installing an accelerated driver module for my graphics card.
<BR>

<BR>
The internet was built around Unix and variants of Unix. I don't think it's a coincidence that significantly larger numbers of servers run Apaches on Linux or FreeBSD than anything else.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't think you're thinking this through very well. What is it that drives you away from Linux? Is it the fact that it's free, and you mistakenly believe that free software is inherently poorer quality than payware? Or is it the fact that you have to think a different way in order to use it?
<BR>

<BR>
Personally I like Linux's way of working. It has broader support than Windows for just about anything you can think of, filesystems especially. I love being able to read my FAT32 file-store partition from both OS's, and my Windows C: drive from Linux. I like its directory structure, which while it has its problems, is somewhat cleaner than Windows', and infinitely more customisable. I especially like the way you can use absolutely ANY GUI style you like, all without having to pay a penny.

<BR><BR>Yeah, that's right.  Microsoft never issued a <b>17MB</b> patch (on top of all it's other patches) a few weeks back then pulled it because it didn't fix ALL the exploits.  Kind of hard to patch a system if the patch isn't available.  How many Service Packs are there for W2K?

Because is so tied into everything Windows it's really part of Windows and not just another app.  Should we talk about the hole in IE that allows someone to track you through Media Player?

I am strongly in favor of more modular solutions; a perfect example of such approach is <a href="http://www.qmail.org/">qmail</a>.
<BR><BR>
The same applies for other popular "bugarium", BIND, which is replaceable by simpler sleeker <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html">djbdns</a>.
<BR><BR>
A rule of thumb, apparently going unnoticed around Microsoft's developers, is that smaller simpler modules are less prone to be buggy and easier to maintain than a big all-in-one monster.

I don't know how you, but if I'd be responsible for a location running Windows machines on mission-critical places, I'd grow peptic ulcers in few months only from the stress coming from distrust against a closed proprietary architecture.
<BR><BR>
But despite of being open-source I don't consider sendmail good solution, at least if only because qmail is available as an alternative. Though if I'd have to select between sendmail/unixoid and Exchange/Windows, the choice would be clear anyway.

I managed to install qmail in a single night, with NO previous experiences above shell-account user level! All I needed was to be used to the commandline, plaintext configuration files, and actually reading the documentation. (Documentation that goes straight to the point, without wasting half the space on describing how to click.)

<i>People use exchange/outlook because it offers the best functionality with the minimum of fuss.</i>

If their admins aren't more than drag'n'droppers, or their managers are Microsofties, well, they get what they deserve. I will not allow Microsoft on a mission-critical server; if they are used to outlook express on the desktops, okay with me (not that I won't bitch, but a couple of attachment-sanitizing scripts on the servers does stellar job in keeping worms away).
<BR><BR>
<i>Email's no good if people can't use it. Most people aren't nerds, so they can't grasp whatever bizarre, half-complete beta software you insist they should use.</i>
<BR><BR>
Hey! For me and all my company (and all the people I moonlight for) the half-complete beta software for free works far more stable and reliable way than the half-complete beta software marketed as finished product for insane prices.
<BR><BR>
And users typically are <i>capable</i> of thinking. They only have to be forced to do so. Sometimes with a cat o' nine tails... My *father* was able to learn commandline tools when he had to!
<BR><BR>
<i>In any case, email is outdated. Everyone uses SMS these days.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yes and no. Instant messaging, both with mobile and stationary clients, is a complement to email. I personally use both in different situations. (And I have a toy to which I can through short emails by sending it a SMS, and receive email summary in form of a SMS when abroad. A short procmail recipe and few lines of code.)

<i>It's the GIGO principle at work and it disqualifies your anecdotal experiences from the realm of human contemplation.</i>
<BR><BR>
Anecdotal experiences of me and just every sysadmin I ever met. Two worst annoyances in admins' lives are Windows and the users.
<BR><BR>
Computers do whatever I tell them to. (Except when powered (down) by Microsoft - then they behave in the style "I will do whatever you want, but only if you will want me to reboot consistently in the middle of startup sequence.) 
<BR><BR>
<i>Were you typing with a pistol that "accidentally" went off?</i>
<BR><BR>
Well-designed pistols don't go off accidentally. Not even when dropped onto hard surface. There was a big affair here when all the police's handguns here turned to be prone to going off when falling on ie. the pavement. Think about it as a faulty error handling.
<BR><BR>
<i>The only other reasonable explanation I can think of is that you were using a pirated copy of Windows2000 with criminal intent, a moral failure which MS code is purposefully designed to thwart.</i>
<BR><BR>
It would explain the crashes that happen on my mostly illegal home LAN. It wouldn't explain *exactly* the same crashes on fully-legal office networks.
<BR><BR>
<i>Let me be succint: there is no way to hack around the V-Chip and IP Token protocols without triggering a general protection fault.</i>
<BR><BR>
If it exists, it can be hacked. If it exists and is widely-enough used, it is only matter of time until it gets hacked.
<BR><BR>
<i>If you take the time to peruse Intel documentation, triggering faults in protected mode is a safety *feature* of modern processor design...</i>
<BR><BR>
Agree. Then it is on the kernel developers to take advantage of it. Microsoft coders apparently fail miserably in both preventing the faults and then handling them.
<BR><BR>
<i>...and professional software engineers differ from Lunatix in their ability to employ all documented chip features as well as undocumented features which are purposefully hidden from hackers for their own good, on the off chance they'll accidentally stumble upon an understanding of those features</i>
<BR><BR>
Hey! I had my copy of leaked Pentium undocumented instructions datasheet with only few weeks delay, and I even hadn't to look for it.
<BR><BR>
<i>(remember the cracker motto: "Computers are too hard for normal people."</i>
<BR><BR>
A microwave oven is too hard for idi... errm... "normal people". Similar claim applies for hot coffee. See the cases of related lawsuits.
<BR><BR>
<i>This is a clear case of Freudian projection; for how can an abnormal disgraceful lot to humanity divine the thoughts of normal people?</i>
<BR><BR>
A couple of friends were working on helplines. They always had fresh supply of horror stories. Helpline duty is the best known cure for getting rid of illusions about humanity; the highest ever necessary dose was about a month, average being about 1-2 weeks.
<BR><BR>
<i>Correct, they cannot, so they compensate by imputing a personal failure onto their superiors. QED, computers are too hard for crackers.)</i>
<BR><BR>
Doesn't explain why "crackers" have negligible incidence of attempting to get a computer running without power cable, thinking a mouse is a foot pedal, or using CDROM tray as a cupholder (NOT an urban legend!!!), in contrast to your beloved "normal" people.
<BR><BR>
<i>The bright side, of course, is that you will soon be rotting on death row, free at last from evil Billy Gates and his pernicious Mind Control OS that suggests you kill everyone who disagrees with your Lunix fantasies of world domination.</i>
<BR><BR>
First they have to get me alive. In case of a standoff, I plan to take couple of 'em to Valhalla with me. If you want to join the ride, consider yourself invited; I heard Valkyries are pretty chicks.

On a side note, to quote a part of a poem from older times when users still had to know how to code...
<BR><BR>
<blockquote>The user writes programs which crash when they can<br>
Not assembler code, but unstructured FORTRAN<br>
He works all the day with a mouse in his hand<br>
And has troubles with bitwise binary AND.</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
Especially the last verse nicely describes the contemporary users; way too many of them are unable even to construct more advanced search engine query - despite that "advanced" here means nothing more than just a few ANDs, ORs, and a handful of brackets.

<BR>

<BR>
If you hack for knowledge, you're a hacker.  If you hack to get credit cards or somesuch, chances are you've got no fucking idead what you're doing and are having a script do all your work for you (read: Script Kiddie).  If you are not, in fact, a script kiddie, you are then a criminal.
<BR>

<BR>
Now me, I'm all for hacking.  Find out as much as possible, just don't do anything illegal when you do it.  Avoid unethical practices while you're at it.  Hell, I even indulge in scripting now and then (my job is clerical, but I end up using Perl scripts to automate quite a few of my functions as they are, yes, functional and thus easy to have a computer do unaided).  I run under Win32, but reluctantly.  
<BR>

<BR>
I also run the Win32 ports of StarOffice, GhostScript/GSView, cURL, PHP, Perl and lcc-Win32.  There isn't a thing I can't do to my work computer, even circumvent admin (direct writes to a finely calculated are of the hard-drive while the OS isn't looking can give my account administrator priveldges).  This is not to say I have done this, but merely a testament to the power available to a well-informed secretary.
<BR>

<BR>
Does this make me a "cracker"?  No.  No goddamn such thing.  Does it make me a criminal?  Is a locksmith a criminal?  How about someone who taguht himself to pick locks for no reason other than the knowledge of how to do it?  No.  How about a "Script Kiddie"?  Nope.  Script Kiddies download their scripts.  I write my own.  
<BR>

<BR>
I, dear friends, am a hacker.  And, guess what.  My boss couldn't love it more.  I get my work done quickly enough that I have copious amounts of time to fuck about the rest of my work day.  I get work done more quickly than she can give it to me.  I get work done SO quickly, I have time to waste on schooling a malinformed, prejudiced, idiot-populated message-board such as, say, Adequacy.org.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It is Microsoft's choice to put out whatever they want.  A free market economy, however, insists that unless a company has become a monopoly, their products will be created as a response to market presssure.  This is something Microsoft hasn't done for a while.  Current market pressure is, (and I think most of you will agree on this) inexpensive and fast in a small package.  Microsoft products, as a general rule, are exorbantly priced, slow, and a HELL of a lot larger than they need to be.<BR><BR>

You think this is fallacy?  Compare Microsoft Office to Sun Star Office:<BR><BR>

Microsoft Office:<br>
<ol>
<li>Comes with Productivity software
<li>Is compatible with most standard formats
<li>Is 650-1300 MB, depending on which version you get
<li>an independant "Office Mark" used to time the creation of documents, recently rated it as 5380 Marks (higher is slower)
<li>Costs anywhere from $99 to $399.
</ol><BR><BR>
Sun Star Office:<br>
<ol>
<li>Comes with productivity software
<li>Is compatible with damn near all standard formats
<li>Is appx 80MB.  Period.
<li>Office Mark: 2520 on same computer, same user, performed on Win32 version.  (this means faster, folks)
<li>Costs nada.  You can <a href="http://www.staroffice.com">download</a> it right now.
</ol><BR><BR>
So you want choice?  There it is.  The monopoly practise is that Microsoft continually advises against using such software, becuase, as they claim, their "tests" have shown that they may cause problems.  No independant testhas been able to replicate these problems, though..  I wonder...<BR><BR>

I am curious, however, when MS is going to start writing its OS to specifically cause problems with OpenSource software.  It's only a matter of time..<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Many months ago, I experimented with the "star office" program, at the behest of another earnest young supporter of free software. My first thoughts upon looking at the interface of this software were that the authors are probably either hiding in some foreign country or languishing in copyright violator's prison. The interface has been stolen completely from Microsoft's product! I was appalled! 

<BR><BR>It gets worse, of course. Ever willing to give the benefit of the doubt to a new idea, I tried to work on one of the many spreadsheets I use to coordinate my speculations in the futures market. I was able to work quite happily within this program, despite a few glitches here and there, which I assume relate to the product's "unreleased beta" status. Little did I know that the open source nazis had laid a clever trap, and its jaws were about to snap shut!

<BR><BR>I returned to the spreadsheet after a few days, only to find that the entire spreadsheet had been destroyed. Not a single field was recoverable! I was extremely annoyed with Sun, who provided me with the "free" office program, a price which, upon careful consideration, I find to be far too dear. 

<BR><BR>Naturally, Sun was well aware of the impact that their product would have on the business of any people foolish enough to attempt to use it seriously. Having lost several months hard work in a single afternoon (not to mention hard-earned money), I contacted Sun's customer service department with the intention of collecting upon Sun's warranty. I was informed that the product which had destroyed my spreadsheet came <i>without any warranty of any sort!</i> Sun had cost me weeks of time, and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars (these losses, you'll be glad to hear, I was able to avert) and they were going to get off scott free. 

<BR><BR>I must strenuously warn all readers not to make the same mistake I made. Trusted software like Microsoft Office is trusted for a reason: It is guaranteed not to cost you any more than the price you paid for it. The same cannot be said of so-called "free" software. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Incidentally, Lunix wouldnt be in perpetual beta if it wasnt consumed with copying yesterday's Windows functionality. See, time flows, Windows gets better and better, and yesterday never catches up with today. In 10 years, Lunix will be as useful as Windows95.

Microsoft isn't any better. They just misstate their software status by a step; Microsoft Beta is real Alpha, and Microsoft Final is in fact just a beta. Whatever it is, they tend to not manage to do it more than very partially right until Release 2.
<BR><BR>
How otherwise you could explain the perpetual showers of servicepacks?
<BR><BR>
Linux versioning is at least more conservative. Plus, many cases of "betaness" are just alibism of the coders, while the code itself is already stable - which is fairly common when the commercial pressures to maintain "appearance" aren't there.

<BR><BR>
No. I am just not lazy to read manuals. And I am not blind stupid to believe that Windows crap isn't half-finished too; Linux at least *admits* it. (Windows NT SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4...)
<BR><BR>
And tell me about a piece of software that is finished - except the core of TeX?
<BR><BR>
<i>There isnt a damn thing running on Linux that doesnt run better on Windows.</i>
<BR><BR>
Whatever it is - DHCP, SMTP/POP3/IMAP, fileserver, nameserver... - whatever mission-critical service it is, Linux (and all other unixoids as well) runs in circles around Windows. The only thing missing is truecolor icons. Who needs them - if the configfiles are sane (which they usually are) - they have enough of comments to explain what option has what meaning. Tell me a service, and I will advise you to not run it on Windows, and sometimes even add some horror stories - I had to admin both, and after phasing the most critical services from NT to Linux I am much happier. Qmail, squid, djbdns... what more can an admin wish for? (Maybe clueful users...)
<BR><BR>
<i>And another thing. Where reasonable people evaluate software according to engineering criteria, you cant seem to stop vomiting political slogans.</i>
<BR><BR>
What political slogans? Mere experience. And as you talk about vomiting - I feel about that way when I have to work more intimately with your beloved windowed mouse-controlled darling. Moving machine from one office to another, tell it that there is not a domain anymore but that the network is a workgroup instead, and finding that as a result it lost all user-related settings. (Applies both to Windows NT 4 and Windows 2000.) Without any warning! Attempt to reset it back failed because there was no domain server there. I had to create new user and reimport mailboxes, essentially to develop a recovery process from scratch. And this is called advanced technology. BAH!
<BR><BR>
<i>I honestly suspect you know nothing about computers that a keen amateur with a boring life and access to the internet cannot learn in a month.</i>
<BR><BR>
Heh. So why I have a stable, well-paid job, and job offers from places like San Jose? Or is there so few of keen amateurs? 
<BR><BR>
With Windows, your life is never boring. If you don't count the time wasted while babysitting reinstalls. But, frankly, I don't like this kind of thrill...
<BR><BR>
<i>You have to be the most unsophisticated Lunix goon imaginable to make the kind of absolute statements you're fond of repeating.</i>
<BR><BR>
I am just a very pissed techie who seen both how the things could be done and how they are done and who became disgusted with the difference.
<BR><BR>
<i>You're nothing but a personification of slashdot.</i>
<BR><BR>
Heh. If I'd at least read them more than scarcely.
<BR><BR>
<i>Defend yourself from what?</i>
<BR><BR>
Idiocy? Unnecessary hassle? Problems that shouldn't exist?
<BR><BR>
<i>The only thing people need to communicate to you is orders for more coffee.</i>
<BR><BR>
At this moment, *I* am the one who puts orders for more coffee - double sugar, please - and who, when on-site, gets them fulfilled immediately.
<BR><BR>
<i>How much longer must we suffer your inflated, unwarranted opinion of self?</i>
<BR><BR>
Don't know. Don't care. Most likely until the machines will do what they are asked to, or until I'll finally get that stroke my heart is promising me, whichever comes sooner.
<BR><BR>
<i>You're quite clearly, certifiably insane.</i>
<BR><BR>
I am a diagnosed psychopath. So I can afford to tell the truth.

<BR><BR>No kidding.  I believe the post you are referring to went like this--

<BR><BR><b>MS knowingly purchased QDOS (and renamed it MSDOS) which</b> <i>its developer had used code licensed to his company (not him specifically)</i>

<BR><BR>Gary Kildall's company, Digital Research, developed the OS (CP/M).  Seattle Computer originally sold it.  Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products developed his own operating system, called 86-QDOS (as CP/M-86 would not be available since the latest version was released before the releases of the 8086 processor).  QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) was written in only 2 months time.

<BR><BR>Here's the problem.  Compare QDOS with Linux.  Linux is an OS that was written to work like Unix (well actually Minix and add functionality).  It was written using none of the officially licensed Unix code.  Tim Paterson claimed this is what he did.

<BR><BR>The simple truth is, is that SCP had CP/M and was to be contracted to sell CP/M-86 in the future.  Much of the QDOS core was actually code taken from CP/M.  The rest <i>was</i> backwards engineered.  Basically QDOS was different <i>enough</i> that the legality of it was blurred.

<BR><BR>Many people like to site that CP/M was a blatant rip off of this or that.  The truth is, is that all desktop OSes at the time were designed in some way to work like their bigger brothers (for familiarity).  CP/M was also written in PL/M which was a language Kildall had also developed.  Intel bought rights to it shortly afterwards but not CP/M.  Well at least it was that way.  Windows had QDOS (which they renamed MSDOS).  Windows looked too much like MacOS (don't forget that Apple had a GUI before that on the Lisa computers).  Windows 95 also looked surprisingly similar to OS/2 Warp (which wound up being released before Win95 when MS delayed it).  As many concepts of the GUI were not actually developed by MS (including things like the TaskBar), KDE and GNOME users can rightfully claim familiarty and not copying.

<BR><BR>Also Apple too successfully sued MS as well.  MS also settled with Apple later.  It would not be a total wipe as it had hope.  Apple only meant to shut up while MS was porting their software to the Mac.  The five year deal ends <i>this</i> August.  If MS pulls out without warning Apple will raise hell about it.

<BR><BR><b>1985</b>
<blockquote><i>Sculley (then the defacto head of Apple) became locked in a battle with Microsoft's Bill Gates over the introduction of Windows 1.0, which had many similarities to the Mac GUI. Gates finally agreed to sign a statement to the effect that Microsoft would not use Mac technology in Windows 1.0--it said nothing of future versions of Windows, and Gates' lawyers made sure it was airtight. Apple had effectively lost exclusive rights to its interface design. This would prove to be an important document in future lawsuits between Apple and Microsoft, involving the Windows interface.</i></blockquote>

<b>1997</b>
<blockquote><i>Jobs, who by now was being referred to as "interim CEO," made the keynote speech, and spoke of the company's upcoming aggressive advertising campaign, upcoming new Macs, and Rhapsody. He also announced an almost entirely new Board of Directors, including Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle. But he saved the best for last. In a ground breaking decision, Jobs announced an alliance with Microsoft. In exchange for $150 million in Apple Stock, Microsoft and Apple would have a 5-year patent cross-license and, more importantly, a final settlement in the ongoing GUI argument. Microsoft agreed to pay an unreleased sum of additional funds to quiet the allegations that it had stolen Apple's intellectual property in designing its Windows OS. Microsoft also announced that Office '98, its popular office package, would be available for the Mac by years end.</i></blockquote><BR><BR></FONT></td>

Furthermore, a child in a third world country can't construct a chip with more than 10 million transistors in it. Also, try making circuits on a motherboard with a piece of scrapmetal cut from something. You will utterly fail. This is actually a process of production that requires a laboratory, dust-free environment and so on. This could not be done in the way you describe, no matter the skill of the people trying it. AMD processors are hotter than Intel, true, but with the recommended cooling they hold together just as good. Take an Pentium 3 for example. At 39 degrees C of heat, it hangs. The corresponding AMD model hangs at about 90 degrees C. Also, AMD Thunderbird beats Pentium-4 in almost every benchmark there is. Face it, everything made in America is not the best there is, just because it's made there. Some things made in taiwan, japan, china and so on are often better (and cheaper). I would very much hesitate myself if I was to buy an electrical component with "Made in the USA" on it. And Reginald, that's operatING system you're looking for. Please know what you're talking about before posting.<br><br>

Btw, you don't glue chips to motherboards. They're soldered on. There's no use for glue in the production process. There are no Pentium PRO's at 1 Ghz. There are none over 200 Mhz. And AMDs chips run at 1,8 Ghz at most. But since they are more efficient, they get more done per clockcycle. AMD chips don't come overclocked. In fact AMD has a protection A previous poster claimed that Linux is illegal. This is incorrect, check for yourselves. Linux comes originally from a system called Minix, which was developed from Unix by Linus Torvalds, and Unix was created by Bell Labs. And we all know where Bell Labs are based, that's right, the US. Unix has been around since the later 60s. Windows didn't become at all popular until the later 80s. <br><br>

This article is just a huge lie. It's like saying a tornado could sweep through a junkyard and assemble a Boeing 747 perfectly. That's how big the chances are that someone could make a chip under the conditions you describe. Any engineer reading this would laugh his ass off.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>Go to the patent archive at www.delphion.com. Do a search for "unix". This will bring up a list of all patents related to the UNIX operating system, many of which Linux illegally infringes upon. 
</b>
<br><br>
All of Linux is open source and no patents are being infringed upon, end of story. If there had been a patent infringement it would not have been allowed to be spread by companies such as Red Hat, Slackware, SuSE and so on... Unix is not really an operating system, it's more like a whole family of operating systems, sharing some common elements.
<b>
<br><br>
For example this patent is clearly infringed upon by many of the automatic update systems available for Linux. Linux's internet "masquerading" support (which allows hackers to pretend to have a different Internet address, so the FBI can't trace them) is stolen from this patent. 
</b>
<br><br>
What automatic update systems are you referring to? Internet masquerading is more commonly used for building routers, allowing families to share a single internet connection among several computers, than for the reasons you seek to make us believe. Also, it's not called IP Masquerading, it's called "spoofing", which is illegal to do. It's very possible though, because of the nature of implementation with which the TCP and UDP protocols were implemented. There are both windows and linux versions of programs to accomplish this.
<br><br>
<b>
From these examples, it should be clear to all but the most fanatical of Linux zealots that Linux is an illegal operating system that is based on the pirated patents and intellectual property of honest American companies.
</b>
<br><br>
Nope, sorry, you're gonna have to be a bit clearer on what parts of linux are infringing on what patents and explain why the companies that hold the original patents haven't sued yet. Especially since the patent you mention is from 1997. Besides, you should see the possibilities in ip masquerading and not just the negative parts of it which were already possible long before it was implemented into the linux kernel.

Does it mean that I infringe on a patent and should pay royalties, even if I never heard about the patent before? </i><br><br>

Well, in the case of this stated patent, no. The given patent claims are for automatic updates which take place only when <i>security vulnerabilities</i> are discovered. So, an auto-update which launches in reaction to the time of day is not claimed of this patent.
<br><br>
In general, though, if you discover you are infringing on a patent, you should contact the patent holder and request a license to use that patent. The patent holder can deny you a license, license it to you for free, license it to you for a fixed fee, license it to you in return for royalties, etc. If you choose not to license the patent you infringe, the patent holder can choose to file a lawsuit against you in a civil court.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you look at your Acceptable Use Policy when you get your cable modem, it will clearly state that only ONE computer may be connected to the cable modem at all times.

More than one computer is never hooked up to the cable modem, therefore were following the policy.

Since most of the people here seem to think that they are the lords of creation and anything that spews from the dark pits that they call minds must be right, I must laugh uncontrollably every time I read a post by T Reginald Gibbons, jsm, and several others.
<BR>

<BR>
Reginald, you insult parents who don't agree with what you do, calling them "horrible fathers" among other things, when you have never met them before just shows your immaturity. Instead of countering with the reasons you stated in your post of why your children wouldn't be going to college, you shot back with a personal insult.
<BR>

<BR>
jsm, you're better but not by much. In your story about the WTC attacks, you say "Many people will use this terrible tragedy as an excuse to put through a political agenda other than my own." While I agree that "scoring points" through partisan bickering is not the answer, the fact that people have other political views than you does not mean that you are right and they are wrong, or that they are right and you are wrong. Its just yours, and their, opinion, not right or wrong in any way unless it leads to the harm of a living, sentient being in the real world.
<BR>

<BR>
Honestly, this is comical. Grow up and learn that apples are different from oranges, and that just because someone RESPECTFULLY disagrees with you doesn't mean that they are horrible people. If they start going "You dumb motherf*cker, what an idiotic S.O.B. you are" then they are obviously too immature to convey their thoughts in an intelligent manner, but that doesn't mean you have to say "This obviously proves that you are an idiot and not worthy of my attention."

Hitler said the same thing, but it was more like "We must kill all the Jews and subhumans to purify the Aryan Race!" Hitler's way of "ignoring" non-white non-Christians was tossing them into the Gas Chamber or putting them up against a wall with a firing squad behind.

Plus, after checking - just for fun - if a piece of code I wrote overnight from scratch by chance doen't infringe on a patent I found that it does, and stopped further search when I found it's more than half a dozen ones, I decided to not worry about something so unimportant as patent infringements; when even displaying multiple strings or syntax colorizing are patented, you have either the choice to shut up and do nothing, or to - oh, gods forbid - infringe.

In the worst case, I'll get taxpayer-funded vacation without having to be permanently on the phone. The plan for such event is to do some serious study I don't have time for now; some math, some higher physics. In case of longer vacation, maybe even to get a degree in 'em.

It already comes, as a good paycheck each month. And the various benefits from the moonlight jobs - premium access to insider-only informations, some cash, long-term equipment loans (ie, a 4-channel 'scope), hands-on experience with various cool toys (a demo of bug detection equipment is scheduled to tomorrow and I am invited), guesting in radio talk shows as a hacker and/or a security expert... And lots and lots of experience points!

In my case, crime pays. :)

<BR><BR>
I wrote a software - GNU/GPL, based on <a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/ijb.html">Internet Junkbuster</a> - that is capable of rewriting browser requests, and selectively - up to the level of individual URLs - allow/deny/fake cookies, route through different proxy (perfect for linking with <a href="http://www.multiproxy.org/">Multiproxy</a> when you seek anonymity), even completely rewrite the request headers, and selectively log complete transactions. As added benefit, it filters out the advertisements. (Hey - make ads that will not blink and "yell" at me from the page, and I will not bother filtering them out. Advertisements are now a sort of <a href="http://www.adbusters.com/">visual industrial pollution</a>.) Originally intended as just a lab tool, to test something other, but then it gone wild...
<BR><BR>
Routing the request away is as easy as writing<br>
<code>^adequacy.org ##GWAY:MPROXY<br>
^adequacy.org ##UAGENT:Generic browser</code><br>
...which routes the request through Multiproxy (its parameters are defined elsewhere) and rewrites the user-agent to "Generic Browser".
<BR><BR>
The proxy also can (and does) insert arbitrary files before and after a text/html file it receives; I use it to insert javascripts with added functionality - disabling window.open handle until the page is fully loaded (which kills popups), disabling onunload() handler (which kills another sort of popups), shows a little icon at the rightmost top of the page with advanced functions - returned server headers, cookies (including cookie editor), page menu that links to web-based services like traceroute and whois, converting the whole page to black-on-white (as some "designers" think ie. magenta on green is good idea), and basically any feature I please. I want it, I write it. Open source.
<BR><BR>
More features in progress, it is still only a beta version.

Resistance is futile.<br>
Capacitance too.

AMD may indeed be maiming young children, but I cannot argue with there price... An AMD processor and a fresh copy of Lunix and I have all the power I need to DOS those self-proclaimed "american" chip manufacturers with my homemade Flash viruses.  In Intel's defense, on my first system the price differential was negligible because I was unexperienced, and Lunix destoyed my hard drive.  Now after several years of hacking (since I was a young teenager), however, I learned how to handle such a system.  Also, I plan to make the move from AOL to an unrestricted ISP in coming weeks. 
<BR>

<BR>
But back to the real point... Is it really fair to criticize AMD for making the effort to maximize it's market share by any means neccesary?  After all, they're not exploiting American workers.  If anything, they are merely increasing out freedoms by providing access to powerful hacking functions (which may not always be used for evil) that American chips spcifically limit.  I'm sure some of you must see things my way...

Because they combine borrowing ideas from Intel with their own research, thus getting better overall results? Because Intel focuses on reaching higher clock speeds, because users are easy to be brainwashed to thinking that higher clock equals automatically higher speed?

I also read, hear, and often witness stories that foster my cynicism about rank-and-file users; using CDROM as a cupholder, attempting to convince the vendor that the monitor is faulty (when it only isn't connected), asking what key is the "any" key - and then believing it is "reset". Or believing that viruses spread by physical contact of the floppies. Or believing they need new computer, while the old one only wants to clean the disk and reinstall Windows. Or thinking they will get full Ethernet speed over a 33k6 modem and then bitching it's slow. Or swapping two PCs that served as printservers - of course with different printers, and leaving the printers on their places, so connecting them to machines with wrong drivers, and then wondering why printing doesn't work...

I was amazed at her toughness; despite the obvious physical pain, she maintained the aztlan.net workers' rights website from a scavenged Microsoft ergonomic keyboard and a computer cobbled together from cast-off parts in the back room of a shack which served as the community centre. Her jaw was firm and her gaze unwavering as she told us about the way in which the female workers in the motherboard hall were treated. 
<BR>

<BR>
umm...right...sorry....no.
<BR>
you can't build a computer off of cast off parts that don't work.  If you did get a machine to run in the sand it wouldn't work for very long.  You sort of need an INTERNET CONNECTION to get ONTO the net and RUN A SERVER which also needs quite a bit of computer knowledge like how to set up /homm /root /user directories with the right permisions.  oh and lets see about this website....

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thank you, writers at Adequacy.org, for providing me another amusing article to read over.  I've come to the conclusion that these articles can't possibly be serious, that this has to be a site devoted to parodies of political activist sites.
<BR>

<BR>
As a matter of curiosity, I ran this article and the previous one where the initial allegations against AMD (and Linux, and computer games, and the Internet, and books...) were made past a few friends.  One is a journalism major, another a history major, and then I also submitted this to a few of my other tech friends.  On all points they laughed.  
<BR>

<BR>
The journalism student pointed out how no respectable newspaper or magazine would publish this stuff, and not for its controversial content, but for the complete and utter disregard for objectivity and research.
<BR>

<BR>
The history student attacked it for its lack of references... there's nothing in this article to back up any of the claims made, the "research" done was simply non-existant.  There's nothing in the article to provide validity to the statements being made.
<BR>

<BR>
We techies had the most fun with this though.  As users of AMD (and Intel) processors, Linux (and Windows), and all the other "evil" things (and the associated "good" counterparts) discusses in these articles, as well as students interested in the history and foundation of the technologies we use, these two articles just don't make sense.
<BR>

<BR>
1)AMD ONLY makes processors (and a few networking products), they do not make motherboards, SDRAM or anything else.  
<BR>

<BR>
2)The construction process described in this specific article is laughable to say the least.  You can't make any high-end computer equipment via the methods described... I doubt there exists a chisel that can carve lines nanometers wide... nor do I think you can use aluminum cans to provide the metal contacts and circuitry on a board.  Oh, and no glue...
<BR>

<BR>
3) Oh, I love the quote you guys have from AMD CEO Gordon Moore.... Few things that are amusing about that quote and preceding paragraph... First off Advanced Micro Devices is AMD... the company you hate... not a congressional lobbying group.  Second off, Gordon Moore is the former CEO of INTEL, now Chairman Emeritus. Oh... and 200kHz?  Don't you mean 200MHz?  (megahertz as opposed to kilohertz)  And AMDs don't sell as Pentium Pros over here... they sell as AMDs, they would definitely get nailed legally if they did that.  And they're 4-years behind US technology?  How is it then that the AMD XP 2000+ chip (1.67 GHz) can out-perform the Intel Northwood 2.2GHz chip?  (http://www6.tomshardware.com/cpu/02q1/020107/index.html)
<BR>

<BR>
If you guys ever want to actually be taken seriously, I strongly suggest you put some research into your work, provide resources and such to back up your statements.  Oh, and please find your nearest college or University and take their introduction to computer hardware course.

It doesn't, that's how.

<BR><BR>Yet you are basing speed on frequency.  That's what Mhz is.  It's a measurement of frequecy.  AMDs are known for better application speed.

<BR><BR>Think of it this way.  Let's say I race someone my own age.  Think of frequency as the number of strides.  He may move his legs faster but I would still keep up or beat him.  Why?

Calling a 'fab' another word for 'slum'? ROFL. That set me skeptical for the rest of the article. Apparently in their 'meticulous investigations', nobody at adequacy.org bothered to check into standard manufacturing practices, as 'fab' is an extremely commonly used term and has absolutely nothing to do with slums -- it stands for 'fabrication', as in the fabrication of devices, motherboards, or anything else. Hell, I worked for a silicon fab as a software engineer for a year and it certainly wasn't a slum. :P

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">(Before I tear into this, you should note that I only came across this site via a link to this story, so my critcisms of adequecy.org are based only a half-hour of perusing the site). 
<BR>

<BR>
My only question is 'how does this website expect to get taken seriously?' This is just another alternative-perspective site that asks to me, a small-c conservative-sceptic, to 'think outside the box' by stuffing me into their 'box;' i.e., by offerring me obviously biased, left-wing polemics against "BIG EVIL," be it government, business, or whatever. 
<BR>

<BR>
The person below posted: 
<BR>

<BR>
"that I expect from Adequacy.org. Hard-hitting, uncompromising, and with no "spin" whatsoever." 
<BR>

<BR>
You call that unconfirmed, unsourced libel-safari into Asia "hard-hitting journalism?" Do you really think that *linking every fourth word or phrase* to a novel on amazon.com is called research, or confirming your sources? Superficially, the links make it look like they done they're homework, but to me it's 
<BR>
mere polish. 
<BR>

<BR>
"It would be interesting to get some reactions from people who own AMD-based machines..." 
<BR>

<BR>
I didn't react as an AMD-owner, but as rational, intelligent person, who just wants to speak out on drivel, to prevent it from further dumbing down on-going debate in society. 
<BR>

<BR>
"are they proud of the slavery and environmental rape that they are directly funding?" 
<BR>

<BR>
Before you accuse me and thousands of other people of being accessories-after-the-fact to international crimes, why don't we ask someone else *other than* adequecy.org? 
<BR>

<BR>
"However, since these machines have a maximum uptime of 20 minutes or so before they overheat and must be shut down, I doubt that we will hear much." 
<BR>

<BR>
Pardon? You must be confused. I understand that pentium4s internally under-cloak themselves by 50% if they exceed temperature tolerances. Is that what you are talking about? 
<BR>

<BR>
"Thanks for an interesting read. I've never been prouder to be an Intel owner." 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not touching that. 
<BR>

<BR>
Sites like adequecy.org practice sensationalism because they can't particpate in serious debates about social-political issues, and they can't participate because their ideas are convincing only to themselves. Dissing AMD with a contrived, 'from-the-font-lines' expose probably achieved nothing but further alienating people like me. That article was biased to the point of being crass. It's libelous bunk trying to pass itself off as journalism-verite.

I'm sure that after reading for a few more minuets, I would find more of the like.  There must be some law against printing this type of false information.
<BR>

<BR>
I, if you have read my previous post in "is your child a hacker" am a well-respected network and PC engineer for a large corporation.  These claims are totally, completely, and utterly false.  This person obviously has no computer expertise as per the many references to "gluing chips on" and bent sheets of metal to make motherboards.  Also the fumes produced by printing PCB's (printed circuit boards, e.g. motherboards) are VERYT toxic.  Any exposure for more than a few minuets would be fatal. 
<BR>

<BR>
The environment and technical expertise to manufacture microprocessors are EXTREAMILY strict.  Processor manufacturing requires a clean room environment.   This means no dirt or dust, even the smallest piece of dust or dirt, even oil from a finger can destroy a processor.  Employees in the printing chamber must be in "bunny" or clean suits.  Chips are produced with highly sophisticated and precise machines, not by hand.  Typically, micro-thin sheets of silicon are "printed" and layered on each other.  Just look up chip manufacturing in a book at you local library.  There is no substitute for the specifications in those books.  If I did my math right to build an equivalent to an AMD Athalon 1.0 Ghz, using individual surface mount transistors, it would take up about 1000 or so football fields.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the motherboards and other PCB's, they must be made with similar machinery.  The trace, (the light green or gold lines on the board), is so close together, they could not be made by hand without about a 99.9% failure rate.
<BR>

<BR>
I can't claim to know the pay or living standards for foreign countries, but I can tell you that the working conditions mentioned above are bogus.  There is no way AMD could produce any chip, let alone the high-quality standard chips they are know for.  Ever notice, that there are no pictures or video of these accounts.  Even then I would be highly skeptical of them.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Ok, the complete inaccuracy of this article aside (as mentioned before, the conditions stated are actually impossible), do you REALIZE what you pay for when you but Top-of-the-line chips?  R&D.  Period.  You're paying for the money spent on research and development.
<BR>

<BR>
For example, did you know that they sell highly miniaturized 80386 chips as microcontrollers?  You can get them with their logic chips and memory all on the same chip for about $50 a pop, direct from Intel.  Why so cheap?  Because the materials and manufacturing of silicon chips is almost inconsequential compared to the cost of the research that goes into designing the latest chip.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD doesn't pay quite so much, as their chips are usually reverse-engineered from Intel's chip documentation.  It's been a thorn in Intel's side for quite a while, but it is, indeed, legal.  Intel's only other course of action would be simply not to publish their documentation, but then software manufacturers wouldn't be able to take advantage of the nifty features in their new chip, making it completely useless.
<BR>

<BR>
Most of AMD's R&D money goes into stacking more action into a single clock pulse, which is why AMD chips end up being faster than Intel, even at slightly lower clock frequencies.
<BR>

<BR>
The rest of it goes into building sturdier chips, making them more heat-tolerant.
<BR>

<BR>
Here's a tip:  If Intel comes out with a chip, wait about a month for AMD to release it's clone.  It will be more stable, faster, and is usually able to be overclocked past the "Magic Number (130% original speed).  Period.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
First there's the name of the airport - Manila International Airport. It's been renamed Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA for short, as everone here knows it as) over 15 years ago (in honor of the late Senator Ninoy Aquino, the latest genereration of heroes fighting for the country's freedom, who was assasinated in 1983). So in a matter of speaking, Manila International Airport no longer exists.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, no specific places were mentioned by name. Of course since I live here I know my way around. No mention of Airport Road (the name of the street that the airport's address is on), Paranaque (the nearest major municipality to the airport), Pasay City (the neighboring city), or Villamore Airbase (the nearby headquarters of the Philippine Air Force, sharing the same runway as the airport). And what the heck is that "Chip Hell"? No one here's even heard of that kind of stuff. We have names like "Industrial Valley" though, which is a well developed area full of factories.
<BR>

<BR>
Next, given the atmospheric conditions here, it's totally impossible to set up a fabrication plant here. Intel, Texas Instruments, and a few other chipmaking companies have ASSEMBLY PLANTS here (they export the sealed fabricated wafers here from the US or other fab capable countries, and here they are enclosed inside their black plastic cases in the clean-room facilities before testing), and I've personally visited both the abovementioned assembly plants. AMD doesn't even have an office here!
<BR>

<BR>
While there are a number of beggar children on the streets, very scarce have those "missing fingers, thumbs or occasionally whole limbs" and "disfigured by burn scars, or blinded and carrying the marks of corrosive chemical spills". Hey Smokey Mountain has already been cleaned out of the map about 3 years ago if you're referring to such a place.
<BR>

<BR>
I think at least this website has done just a bit better than the locally famous www.pldt.com for entertainment.

I own 4 Computers all AMD, They all run great and not a single burn out, Rock stable, screaming fast, run hella smooth, and very compatible. Sure they may run alittle hotter but if you apply the proper cooling there we be no problems at all, this site and Intel are just jellous about AMD success and trying to put them down. You just watch, once hammer comes out (Intel's worest nightmare) AMD is going to blow Intel away and in several years from now you will see AMD with the hammer or maybe something newer by then as the new God of Processors. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
secondly, AMD does not have a fab at the Phillipines. They have high-tech and clean fabs in Austin, Texas, and Dresden, Germany. 
<BR>
QUOTE:
<BR>
" "fab" (short for "favela", from the Spanish for "slum")."
<BR>

<BR>
"Fab" actually stands for fabrication facility.
<BR>

<BR>
thirdly, there is no such thing as a 200KHz Pentium. The first processor in the world was a 1MHz (1000Khz) unit.
<BR>

<BR>
Fourthly, AMD does not sell their processors under the name Pentium Pro, they sell their processors under the name "Athlon".
<BR>

<BR>
HAHA, I laugh at the bit where they say that thet make their glue out of animal bits.
<BR>

<BR>
Whjether this is a joke or not, this article is still an INSULT to the people of the Phillipines and to AMD. 
<BR>

<BR>
Poor craftsmen does not have the expertise to make (in this case 'carve'!) such complex things as computer chips containing millions of transistors. Computers are so complex that they have to be made in an atomic scale. It requires engineers guaduating from university and special equipment in order to do that. 
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, AMD processors are high performance processors. They outperform Intel processors even though they have a lower clock speed and they are also much cheaper. However, the price of AMD chips are cheap to gain market share and AMD is already experiencing a loss since they are selling their chips for so cheap. It is not because of slave labour. Intel have reduced prices on their Pentium 4 products to COMPETE WITH AMD. It is UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE to overclock a 200Khz processor to a 1Ghz processor. (Thats like increasing the speed of the processor by 5000 times!!!!) There is a limit in overclocking and if you push the chip too hard it will overheat and die.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
