		Recent events have left America shocked and stunned.

<p>


So you can understand my disgust when I discovered that a "<a href="http://www.spinaltap.com/home.html">Heavy Metal</a>" rock band has been attempting to cash in on bioterrorism...<p><p>
<B>[Editors note, by dmg] This <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_400516.html">report from the Netherlands</a> demonstrates that our European friends have more decency than some of us here at home. Why can't Joey Belladonna simply admit he was wrong, and rename his band ?</B>        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">When I heard the terrible news about the possible Anthrax infections in <a href="http://www.xyno.de/">Florida</a> and <a href="http://www.lethal-records.com/griff/griff.htm">New York City</a>, my first instinct was to find out as much information as I could. After all, I didn't want to overreact (since that is what the terrorists <i>want</i> us to do). There is nothing more sad than the sight of once-proud Americans flocking like frightened sheep to their local Army Surplus <a href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/12770/story.htm">in search of gas masks</a>. Such overreaction makes us look stupid in the eyes of the world, and plays into the hands of those who would terrorise us.<p>


So instead of running in a blind panic to the local <a href="http://www.survivalistchronicles.com/">survivalist</a> store to purchase a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1560000/1560866.stm">gas mask</a>, I turned to the Internet, always reliable as a diverse source of up-to-date information on any subject under <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2001352250,00.html">the sun</a>. I then did what many of us do innocently all the time. I typed in the "Uniform Resource Locator" <a href="http://www.anthrax.com">http://www.anthrax.com</a> assuming that it would take me to some informative resources on this terrible disease. Boy was I ever wrong !!!.<p>


Anthrax appears to be the name of a new "<a href="http://www.thegatesofhell.org/grindcore/grindme.html">Grind-Core</a>" rock band who are prepared to take controversy beyond the bounds of good taste and decorum, and into the realms of Satanic depravity.<p>


Apparently they have a new CD out hatefully entitled '<a href="http://www.anthrax.com/html/discs/ANTHRAX_spreading.htm">Spreading the Disease</a>' which is full of songs praising bioterrorism


<p>


The most incredible part of the whole story is the press release at their site, which shows how insensitive and unrepentant this "<a href="http://www.deathmetal.com/">Death Metal</a>" rock band seems to be.<p>


<i><strong>Before the tragedy of September 11th the only thing scary about Anthrax was our bad hair in the 80's and the "Fistful Of Metal" album cover. Most people associated the name Anthrax with the band, not the germ. Now in the wake of those events, our name symbolizes fear, paranoia and death. Suddenly our name is not so cool. To be associated with these things we are against is a strange and stressful situation. To us, and to millions of people, it is just a name. We don't want to change the name of the band, not because it would be a pain in the ass, but because we hope that no further negative events will happen and it won't be necessary. We hope and pray that this problem goes away quietly and we all grow old and fat together.</strong></i><p>


It is incredible that this American band, sitting safely in the decadent rock-star comfort of their <a href="http://www.winnebagoind.com/">Air-Conditioned Winnebago</a> feel they can continue their tasteless juvenile antics, while our brave soldiers are fighting on the front line against who knows what kind of evil barbarians ?<p>


Recently our politicians have been giving out some sensible advice in these times of trial, asking that each and every American is very careful to 'watch what he says'.<p>


Just who do these second rate "<a href="http://www.anus.com/metal/about/speedmetal.html">Speed Metal</a>" band think they are ? On the one hand, Dave Mustaine complains that people are stealing the band's music via Napster, and yet at the same time, he feels free to insult the record buying public with his irredeemable horrifically tasteless posturing, at a time when the whole country is feeling weak and vulnerable.


<p>


I am not going to make any excuses for this band. Maybe they thought they were being funny. Maybe the death of 6000 innocent people is a joke to them.<p>


I am not laughing.<p>


Any of you who agree with me that this band needs to learn some taste and judgement should email Anthrax directly, and ask them to rename themselves forthwith. Obviously it will be better if you write your own message, but if you are pushed for time, feel free to use this pre-written example message: <a href="mailto:alphamail@anthrax.com?subject=Please, please consider changing your name.&body=A plea to the band currently known as ANTHRAX%0A%0A


I am sure you are aware of the recent Anthrax infections in Florida and New York City. While I appreciate your right to artistic expression, I feel that your band's name is inappropriate in these times of crisis.


%0A%0A


Many people find the name of your band to be offensive, and in very poor taste during these trying times.


%0A%0A


In case you were unaware, the symptoms of Anthrax are nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea. Intestinal anthrax results in death in 25% to 60% of cases. 


%0A%0A


I am sure that being a member of the band 'Anthrax', gruelling touring schedules notwithstanding is nowhere near as painful as actually suffering from the disease itself. 


%0A%0A


I respectfully suggest that until the war against terrorism is over, that you consider changing the name of your band to something less offensive.


%0A%0A


Perhaps you could call yourself 'Ant Wax' or 'Aunt Frax' or something else that would preserve the continuity of your image, without causing such enormous offense to the more vulnerable members of society.


%0A%0A


It would be a great way for you to do your bit to help us heal the wounds of 11th September and join in America's fight against the terrorist menace. 


%0A%0A


It need not affect your record sales. Other artists have made similar changes with no effect on their bottom line, for example P-Diddy changed from Puff Daddy, since the word 'Puff' was an irresponsible reference to drug-usage which could have led children astray. He chose to do the right thing and protect the children by changing his name. Indeed the name change gained him a lot of positive media coverage. 


%0A%0A


Thank you for reading this, and again I hope you like Puff Daddy, have the courage to change your name, for the good of all America's children.

I hope the sheer number of concerned readers here at adequacy.org will mean that pressure can be brought to bear on them. They seem like decent enough people, apart from the disgusting lyrics to their songs (mostly about death and destruction) and their unkempt, dishevalled aggressively long hair. Perhaps reason can prevail, and the hurting that we are <i><strong>all</strong></i> feeling can be healed.<p>

<BR>
What is aggressive hair like? Can it attack me? How do I protect myself from aggressive hair? Now I'm scared. 
<BR>

<BR>
It's spelled "dishevelled", genius. And try to check your facts before embarking on another rabid tirade against this big, scary world that has you so clearly peeing your pants and running to Mommy Church. 
<BR>

<BR>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as defining what America (the United States actually...America includes the areas south of here that we rather ruthlessly exploit and oppress)is about, liberty is a little highher on the totem pole than Christianity. Freedom of religion, expression and all that? 
<BR>

<BR>
So, what's with all these religious patriots calling for all kinds of censorship? They are totally and irredeemably un-American. 
<BR>

<BR>
And the whole gun argument: where does this statistic re: crime going up after gun control legislation being introduced originate from? I have run into it many times, but never in any form other than the traditional statement of "When legislation was introduced in England..." The source is apparently "Cos I said so"? 
<BR>

<BR>
Wow. Tickle me pink. In any case, trying to argue a case with statistics is just stupid. Remeber what they say about statistics? Remember, statistics are what advertisers use. 
<BR>

<BR>
Ban stupid Christians. 
<BR>

<BR>
I prefer the intelligent, open-minded ones that actually live by the teachings of Jesus. 
<BR>

<BR>
I don't care for this room-temperature-in-Celsius-IQ crowd, who goes about sticking their proverbial, Bible-misinterpreting genitalia in the mashed potatoes of freedom when people are just trying to live their lives.

I hope you're not trying to call Anthrax "idiot local musicians." They have been around for two decades and have sold millions of albums worldwide. BTW, I AM standing up to something I know in my heart to be evil: mindless reactionism.

<BR>

<BR>
Who are you to say whose expression does or doesn't matter? Who are you to say what is trash and what is not? Later on in your post you talk about "moral relativism." Morals ARE relative. Your morals seem to imply that everyone has to feel the same way about Anthrax (the band). My morals tell me that you can love them or hate them, but their First Amendment right supercedes that.
<BR>

<BR>
My morals also tell me that people who think Anthrax should change their name "out of respect" or whatever are defective. THEY WERE HERE FIRST. The entire world does not have to throw a prozac panic attack whenever someone might get offended.
<BR>

<BR>
/* It is the way of strength to stand, even before the tyranny of the past. */
<BR>

<BR>
What do you mean by that? Are you saying that Anthrax (the band) is somehow "tyrannical"? Perhaps you should listen to some of their music before you get all high and mighty and condemn them. They rail against racism and other ill conditions in society.
<BR>

<BR>
/* Oh, so we're supposed to sit back and fan our faces with our TV Guides as the fifth column of perdition hauls down its pants to smear diarrhea all over our laws and ways. */
<BR>

<BR>
I can't really answer this fully because you haven't really said what you are talking about. You could be inferring that a band not changing its First Amendment-protected name is "smear[ing] diarrhea all over our laws and ways". If this is the case, I would encourage you to read the Bill of Rights, because it lies at the core of our laws and ways. Otherwise, set the record straight and say what you are really talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
/* It's a shame I didn't spend as much time practicing moral relativism as you. I might have had a future as a prostitute for some ridiculous university radicalism. */
<BR>

<BR>
It's a shame you are talking like a blithering reactionary fool who thinks everyone else has to conform to your standards. They don't. It's a free country, you don't have a right to expect not to be offended by every last entity in it. If you don't like it, I suggest you schedule a debate to look into striking the First Amendment. I support your right to do so, but you would be well advised to wear a bullet-proof vest.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Only if you think it would be cool to totally entrust your freedom to a government run by humans, who are by nature corruptible, and criminals, who by nature won't turn in their firearms. Gun crime surged in England after they clamped down on handguns, as the crooks knew that they could pick a house, any house, and be almost assured that whomever was inside would not have a gun. A well-armed society is a polite society. People who thought it would be a great idea to disarm all civilians include Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. Read on.

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!! "Everyone agreed with everyone else" indeed! Yes, let's get rid of the first and second amendments. Great.

It seems to me that you want freedom to worship God (or the gods or mother nature or nothing at all or whatever) in your way, while denying others their right to the same. Freedom of religion (including not being religious at all) is a hallmark of this country, and I, for one, am tired of narrowminded religious bigots calling other people "unamerican." Denying a person their freedom of expression is the antithesis of what this nation stands for, and what makes it so great - diversity. And while you rail against "heathens" (or, as the Taliban would say, "infidels"), I think what you are saying is simplistic and borderline idiotic, but I still support your right to say it, and will die in the defense of that right if need be.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

How stupid. Dying to defend a point of view which is completely incompatible with your own.<BR><BR>

You are more likely to die by an accidental gunshot wound caused by one of your 'constitutionally correct' guns.<BR><BR>
The point is, that if you allow unrestricted free speech (which even our constitution does not - just try shouting 'fire' in a crowded movie theater) you allow all kinds of hateful and anti-freedom speech to be made.<BR><BR>
Now, when I say that free speech is not a good thing, I don't want to clamp down on people who believe in freedom, but rather to ban the kind of speech that would promote fascism or other kinds of political extremism. <BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
"They were reluctant to ratify the Constitution without further assurances, and thus we find in the Bill of Rights Amendments 2 and 3, specifically authorizing a decentralized militia, guaranteeing the right of the people to keep and bear arms, and prohibiting the quartering of troops in any house in time of peace without the consent of the owner."
<BR><BR>
The US Army is not decentralized, nor is the National Guard. In the justice's opinion, the point of the 2nd Amendment is that we, the people, should be able to defend ourselves in case we are invaded. In the case that an invading force breeches our defenses, a well-armed militia is all that stands between them and domination.
<BR><BR>
Moreover, the text of the 2nd Amendment states that, "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." And so there is support for a well-regulated militia (which is not referred to as an army). Furthermore, the last half of the sentence says, <b>in no uncertain terms,</b> that the right of <b>the people</b> to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
<BR><BR>
If you make it illegal for civilians to own guns, the only civilians who own guns will be criminals. They will not turn in their guns. Rather, they will see a freshly-disarmed populace... easy pickings. They will go into your home with the full knowledge that you haven't got a gun. Then they will steal everything you own, and perhaps even kill you.
<BR><BR>
A friend of mine works in law enforcement and related the story of two individuals who passed through the juvenile hall where he works. These two guys would go, armed, into people's houses. They would then rape everyone there (man, woman, child, and adult, all the same), and then rob them. Do you really want these lunatics to be the only civilians with guns? Or is it perhaps that you pretend there is no such thing as a black market? If they broke into your house, would you rather wait five minutes for the cops to arrive (assuming they didn't cut the phone lines first or prevent you from getting to a phone), or kill them? How well do you suppose you could plead with these men while they were raping your mouth?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I haven't lost a thing, dear anonymous reader. I quoted the opinion of a Supreme Court justice, which you did not refute. You also failed to refute my assertations as to why the populace should be armed. I guess this is because you know my argument is logically consistent and that you have zero chance of besting it. Don't feel bad, though. It is natural to try to use a technicality to invalidate an argument rather than attacking it head-on.

The original argument was that the right to keep and bear arms is not constitutional. Go read that PDF. I was asked to yield up a case regarding the Deuce, and I went for that distraction rather than sticking to the original argument. My mistake. Perhaps I should do more research, yes, but what about said original argument? It IS my constitutional right to keep and bear arms. The Supreme Court may have the power to determine what sort of arms I can own, and whether or not I have to register them, and whether or not they need serial numbers, etc. But I am one of "the people," and my right to keep and bear arms, as the Deuce says, shall not be infringed.

Here's my answer to the rest of your questions: 981 people died due to accidents with guns in the US in 1997 and 17,000 were injured. Enjoy accidentally killing or injuring yourself and those near you.  
<BR>

<BR>
52% of gunshot deaths in the US are suicides. Enjoy killing yourself intentionally. The heavy metal should help with that.
<BR>

<BR>
In homes with guns, the homicide rate is 3 times as high as in those without. Enjoy killing your family and friends intentionally.
<BR>

<BR>
Use of firearms for criminal purposes outnumber defensive use of guns by 6 to 1. Enjoy losing the leg you were hopping around the argument on. 
<BR>

<BR>
No federal court has ever struck down a gun control law in the United States. Enjoy the fact that the courts don't agree with your reading of the constitution.

Gun crime may have dropped after the gun ban, however violent crime in general increased markedly (estimated between 10 and 30% increase '97 - '01). This is due to criminals knowing their targets do not have a gun with which to defend themselves.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Well folks, I'm not going to knuckle under. Anyone who would like to tell me how wrong I am (*snicker*) can reply to this post. I'm not going to keep track of three different threads any more.
<BR>

<BR>
SETTLED LAW ARGUMENT:
<BR>
I concede that there is no supreme court decision that gun control is somehow "illegal." In order for such a case to arrive at the Supreme Court, the legislative branch or a state government would have to attempt a massive disarming of civilians. A total firearms ban, not just on expensive toys like Uzis. It'll never happen. Such a ban would be unconstitutional.
<BR>

<BR>
INTERPRETATION OF 18TH CENTURY SEMANTICS:
<BR>
There are arguments on both sides. Some of the framers thought civilians ought not be guaranteed any right to arm themselves. Other framers thought that to deny such a right would be the single best way to enslave them. More modern personages who agree with this notion include Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, whose forces stood to gain a lot by having the citizens disarmed. Clearly the framers did not agree on a number of things. However, the 2nd Amendment says "the people" - as in, "We, the people", not "We, the people who are in an army". Yes, yes, you have an amicus brief to throw at me, I'm sure! Well, I have quotations from the framers that say your amicus briefs are full of beans. Who's right and who's wrong? Neither and both. It's a purely subjective argument.
<BR>

<BR>
I could also posit that we do have a well-regulated militia in gun owners, since they are required to register many of their firearms, and stand as the single last line of defense in the case that our national army is overrun. Oh yeah, one more thing. If guns had been banned by England, we would not have stood a chance of winning the revolution, because A) our ragtag army would not have had a means to present a real threat to the lobsterbacks; and B) even if the army had guns, many local nonmilitary residents were called upon to help deflect said lobsterbacks.
<BR>

<BR>
BENEFITS VS. DANGERS:
<BR>
Bunk. Over ten thousand people are murdered in this country every year, and less than a thousand of these murders were accomplished with a gun. The very large majority of murders are accomplished via other means. Furthermore, banning guns would do nothing to address the cause of murder. Tens of thousands are injured by guns every year. However, 3,200,000 people were injured by cars in 1999, with 15,794 fatalities. Cars are responsible for an exponentially higher number of injuries than guns. There are people who drive drunk and endanger us all, it's true, but should we then ban all cars and force everyone to ride bikes and mopeds because of the poor decision-making capability of a minority of people?
<BR>

<BR>
The argument about suicide is similarly flawed. Guns are but one of many hundreds (thousands?) of methods available to a suicide case. Again, banning guns would not solve the underlying problem of insanity.
<BR>

<BR>
Gun usage: 1 in self-defense to 6 in crime. That's nice. At least that 1/6th segment had a chance to defend themselves. I wonder how much larger that segment would be if more people had (and used) permits to carry concealed weapons. It also completely ignores the gun usage that occurs at shooting ranges.
<BR>

<BR>
Domestic violence: Again, this is caused by insanity, not inanimate objects. You ban the guns and people will still have Ginsu knives in their kitchens, pokers by their fireplaces, pens in their pockets, blunt objects on their mantles, etc.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Compare the amount of time a person takes learning to drive to the amount of time taken learning to shoot a gun. It's clear that guns are an ineffective deterrent to crime, since most criminals don't know how to use guns. Allowing the people to have guns is exactly the same as giving bombs to children.

We no longer permit people to operate motor vehicles without proof of competency, nor should we, as a car is a piece of heavy machinery and improper use can very easily lead to death.
<BR>

<BR>
I support a similar licensing requirement for guns. They are dangerous in inexperienced hands. Before being allowed to buy a gun, a person should be required to show proof that they have completed an extensive gun safety and usage course. (I think it should be harder to get a gun license than a driver's license, because they give those out like candy to people who just don't have the skill to drive.)
<BR>

<BR>
There is a test one must take to obtain a hunting license, but it's mostly just common-sense questions; just about anyone can pass it.
<BR>

<BR>
As far as guns "clearly" not being a deterrent to crime, I have addressed that elsewhere.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, disarming the people requires that you have complete trust that your government is not now and never will be run by individuals who would deprive us of as many freedoms as they can get away with, under the guise of "protecting" us or something similar. I don't want to live in a nanny state.
<BR>

<BR>
Humans are corruptible. I, for one, believe the government is more polite to us because they KNOW we are armed. If the only people who are armed are taking their orders from politicians (i.e. the police and armed forces), who as I have said are corruptible, where is the counterbalance? There is none. Our representatives don't have to comply with the wishes we express in letters they receive from us; they can vote as they like, according to their own moral sense, with no regard for their constituents' wishes. They can be bribed, and often are. The day may come when an armed citizenry is the only thing that stands between the people and heinously suppressive behavior.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't believe me, look at Germany. Their government was led by a real smooth talker (Hitler), who was able to convince the majority that Jews as a race were responsible for the problems of their country.
<BR>

<BR>
Then look at the mass internment of Japanese that went on RIGHT HERE in the USA. Again, we see a government abusing its powers to an outrageous extent in the name of "protection." Granted, the Japanese had it easy compared to the Jews, but they were still forced to sell all their posessions at laughable prices before getting herded onto trains and placed in prison camps.
<BR>

<BR>
The Germans were fooled, and we were fooled. I don't think that *exact* sort of thing can happen again, but who knows what the next hundred years will bring?
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, what if an invading force overruns our national defenses? It might not be likely NOW, but what about twenty years from now, or fifty? Armed citizens might be the one chance we had for a last stand. Armed citizens in Los Angeles certainly played a role in repelling rioters from their businesses back in '92, when it was demonstrated that our police force and the National Guard could be rendered ineffective by nothing more than bad management.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You're looking at an effect instead of its cause. Guns, strychnine, cars, airplanes, railroad spikes, Ginsu knives, heavy ashtrays, and claw-tool hammers don't kill people; people do. And as I have said before, they will simply resort to other devices if they cannot obtain a gun. Furthermore, how do you propose to achieve this "no guns" situation? What about the black market? What about people who simply don't turn them in? The US government can't stop tons of drugs from crossing the border every day, nor will they be able to stop guns from entering the country. On top of that, "zip guns" are relatively easy to build; an inmate in a maximum security prison was able to build one and shoot a guard with it. If a dude in a maximum security prison can build a firearm, so can I. Finally, you imply that getting rid of guns will cause crime to decrease. That certainly didn't happen in England. The ROOT PROBLEM of insanity is not going to be solved by removing inanimate objects.

You are far more likely to get killed or injured by a car or AIDS. 981 is what percent of the population? We've got almost 300,000,000 people in this country. What part of those injuries were caused by violent crime? Guns don't cause crime, mentally defective people do.

Actually, if I was going to off myself, I'd probably put on Moonlight Sonata or perhaps some Vivaldi. And I certainly wouldn't use a gun - that is very messy and painful.

That doesn't take into account how many people were assaulted with a gun who were not carrying their own guns.

You (and I mean that in the plural) launched a big ploy to divert me from the point of the argument, which is that I, as a citizen, have a right to keep and bear arms. Gun control laws do not prohibit me from owning guns. (Some guns are illegal, but not all, and if all I have is an old revolver, that's still a case where I'm armed.) None of the challenges to gun control laws have been brought forth by any significant group of people. The Supreme Court is unlikely to ever hear a case on a "gun control" law that dictates that all freemen be stripped totally of their arms, because no such law would survive the lower courts.

Who cares how you would off yourself? Apparently 7,500+ americans each year choose guns. Don't waste my time. Statistics have shown that a person living in a house with a gun is 5 times more likely to commit suicide than someone without.

Cars have serious uses besides killing. (remember, SERIOUS. Hunting isn't serious.) Besides which, your argument is a classic straw man. What do cars have to do with guns?

I have no idea where you are going with your response to the statement that completely disembowels your self-defense argument. I assure you, that number is the total number of crimes averted using guns. The other figure is the total number of crimes committed using guns. 600,000 to 100,000. The figures outweigh your "facerape" anecdotal evidence about a million-billion to 1.

Finally, the 2nd amendment has nothing to do with individual rights. The accepted reading of it refers to the states' rights to arm their own militias. Several of the quotes you gave support this view over the individual rights view. In fact, the right of citizens to form militias has been rejected by the supreme court.

False perhaps, but not a lie. Lying involves intent to deliberately say something that is false. If I wanted to lie, I wouldn't have provided a link, hoping that you would take the citation at face value. Instead, I posted a link to what I was quoting, giving you every opportunity to review it yourself and post a rebuttal if you disagreed.

What makes you think you've "won," exactly? The statement is completely subjective. You can say I've "lost" because I couldn't answer a question, and I can say it doesn't matter because the question was irrelevant to begin with. I am not going to pretend that I am a perfect individual, but for you to tell me that I have a "problem" and that I should get rid of T-shirts is ridiculous, irrelevant to the discussion, and - again - subjective. I don't even have heavy metal T-shirts!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There has never been a <i>Constitutional</i> right to own guns, any more than there ever has been a Constutional right to own TV sets. People are simply allowed to own crap, but that crap can be regulated to the point of being outlawed in the marketplace. 
You will not find one reference to their ownership as a <i>Constitutional</i> right in the words of any  judge (modulo 1 or 2 community college judges named Bubba) or founding father.
<BR><BR>
Originally, guns were looked upon as military tools, and the terms of their private ownership was strictly regulated by the states according to requirements of civil and military defense.
Some Colonies passed laws making their seizure the perogative of the government.

It's really obvious. "the People", as an unmodified term (i.e. not constrained, as in "the people of a town", etc.) is not used in the Constitution or Bill of Rights to indicate a class of people smaller than every freeman of the United States.
<BR><BR>
<a href="http://www.2ndlawlib.org/court/fed/sc/494us265.html">Read this.</a>
<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
"The Preamble declares that the Constitution is ordained and established by "the People of the United States." The Second Amendment protects "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms," and the Ninth and Tenth Amendments provide that certain rights and powers are retained by and reserved to "the people." See also U.S. Const., Amdt. 1 ("Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of <i>the people</i> peaceably to assemble") (emphasis added); Art. I, � 2, cl. 1 ("The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by <i>the People of the several States</i>") (emphasis added). While this textual exegesis is by no means conclusive, it suggests that "the people" protected by the Fourth Amendment, and by the First and Second Amendments, and to whom rights and powers are reserved in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community."
</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
The "textual exegesis" may not be conclusive, but so far I haven't seen anything on the other side which is conclusive.
<BR><BR>
/* Dictionaries of the time had entries for "arms" which included the phrase "bear arms". Dictionaries are compilations of language usage. Read this. */
<BR><BR>
I read it. The opinion expressed there is contrary to the opinion expressed in the paragraph I posted. Who's "right"? I say that what I cited hits the nail on the head. As far as the significance of the phrase "bear arms," the framers had every opportunity to specify "for military service." They did not. Furthermore, your link states:
<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
"Congress' revisions to Madison's draft focused the Amendment still more sharply on protecting the militia; and debate surrounding the Amendment concerned not "an individual right implicit in ordered liberty," Slip. Op. at 5, but rather ensuring that states would have armed militia available as a counterweight to any standing army established by the new federal government."
</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
What is said here has no more weight than any of the things I cited, as it is not stated in the Constitution or in the Bill of Rights. See the Ashcroft letter from my previous post; it was commented that the right of a people to remain armed was a key to preventing their enslavement. Even that is not a matter of law as I see it, but it makes perfect sense to me, and if you would argue against it, you'd be going even further away from the core of the argument. I'll elaborate later on.
<BR><BR>
There are no Supreme Court decisions regarding the Deuce that have anything to do with a significant group of people. You asked me to find a decision on this. There are none. It would be impossible for a case like this to reach the Supreme Court, because such an action would never survive the lower courts. NEVER. (See? I can repeat words of negation too!) Very clever of you to distract me from the original point of the argument by asking me to provide evidence about something which is not a main point of the argument to begin with, but as soon as you find a Supreme Court ruling that supports mass disarming of citizens, let me know. I sincerely doubt you will be able to find one, because no one in power is foolish enough to even try.

Who is Linux Torvalds?
<BR><BR>
All you have proven is that you wish to dodge behind anonymity. The implication that I think it's my Constitutional right to know who you (whether "you" be singular or plural) are, is utterly ludicrous. "Can you please" is not the same as "I demand that you", nor even close. In fact, I think Rob Malda put it best: You are an Anonymous Coward. I'm not planning on giving up any time soon, but you can tuck your tail between your legs and run off any time you want because some other anonymous coward might take your place, and I wouldn't be any the wiser.

<BR><BR>
You agree with yourself? Thanks, Captain Obvious! See above for my rebuttal of this idea that "the people" refers to "the army" or "the national guard" or "a city" or some organization which some of the people have membership in, but which isn't "the people" themselves, since an organization is not a person or a group of people, but an abstract entity. A man is not an abstract entity. A thousand men are not an abstract entity.
<BR><BR>
/* The 2nd does in fact mean the citizens of the united states have the right to defend themselves in a well regulated militia further subject to the further subject to Article I, Section 8. */

What part of section 8?
<BR><BR>
/* Because that is the subject addressed by the 2nd Amendment. (Read that link, its a history of the militia debates and phrasing of the 2nd Amendment. It will become clear to you that the 2nd is a military amendment, not a constitutional individual right.) */
<BR><BR>
An interesting read, particularly this bit:
<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
"The rights of conscience, of bearing arms, of changing the government, are declared to be inherent in the people. Freedom of the press too."
</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
I suppose you'll have an explanation as to why I, an individual, have no right to conscience, changing the government (to the extent that I can lawfully do so as an individual), or to run a free press all by my lonesome. These two sentences link those three rights together with the right to bear arms as being one and the same in terms of how rightful they are for individual citizens to have.
<BR><BR>
But like I said, before, these are quotes from debates. They are not the letter of the law. Now you are debating what the founders wanted, but that's already an uphill battle because they didn't all agree!

<BR><BR>
<i>It's really obvious. "the People",</i>
<BR><BR>
Whoa, back up. We were talking about "bear arms", remember? You asked how it was that "bear arms" was an 18th century term for serve in militia instead of the modern nra fantasy "own guns".
<BR><BR>
<i>I read it. The opinion expressed there is contrary to the opinion expressed in the paragraph I posted. Who's "right"? </i>
<BR><BR>
Please stop equivocating on the subject. The opinion is that the People's right to bear arms means the People have a right to their own civil defense under a militia, not that individuals have a civil right to own and dispose of guns as they wish outside of that militia. That is the opinion, an opinion you have not even remotely contradicted. Ergo, you are not right.
<BR><BR>
<i>the framers had every opportunity to specify "for military service.</i>
<BR><BR>
Pay attention. "Bear arms" is the way "military service" was referred to back then. And the *militia* debates on the wording of the 2nd implied what to you, exactly -- NRA propaganda? Moreover, gainsaying the framers' prose is evidence for nothing less miserable than someone who has run out of documentary facts and argument grasping at straws. 
<BR><BR>
How incredibly, frustratingly, incorrigibly intransigent you gun goons are in debate.
<BR><BR>
<i> What is said here has no more weight than any of the things I cited, as it is not stated in the Constitution or in the Bill of Rights. </i>
<BR><BR>
You resist historical evidence for the meaning and purpose of
the 2nd, you resist legal evidence for the juridical interpretation of the 2nd, but ...
<BR><BR>
<i>See the Ashcroft letter from my previous post; </i>
<BR><BR>
... you are content to cite the word of the most contentious, anti-civil libertarian attn. general in the history of modern America instead. 
<BR><BR>
Wonderful. 
<BR><BR>
Ashcroft's opinions are not documentary evidence of history, they are not case law, and they are not legally enforceable. Let me explain something to you. Your standards of evidence are woefully inadequate compared to your opposition. You are required to present documentary history and case law. Can you do this?
<BR><BR>
<i>All you have proven is that you wish to dodge behind anonymity.</i>
<BR><BR>
Can you please stick to arguing the issues rather than the man? I'm not interested in your ignorance of ad hominem and genetic fallacies, I want to see your evidence that the 2nd is a <i>Constitutional</i> right for <i>individuals</i> to own guns.
<BR><BR>
<i>I have addressed this above. A writ of certioari will never be addressed by a court for a case that doesn't reach it. :)</i>
<BR><BR>
No, I'm sorry, numerous 2nd Amendment cases have been appealed upto the SCOTUS. According to SCOTUS guidelines, certioari is denied because none of the appellate courts have misinterpreted Miller. Finally, if you dont think <i>enough</i> cases have been brought to their attention, take it up with the NRA who has never contested gun law on the basis of the 2nd. Presumably the NRA knows something you dont. Can you guess what that might be?

Nope, I'm afraid your battle was lost before you imagined it began. There is no Constitutional individual right to own weapons, meaning they can be regulated according to statutory law according to the whim of your legislature. In the unanimous opinion of every decision ending on appeal, the 2nd Amendment is a communitarian militia right which is survived today in the national guard. 
<BR><BR>
This is a matter of settled law. Instead of telling me what you think one half of the 2nd means, and instead of indulging in your linguistic fantasies, why dont you look up the case law and the militia debates prior to ratification? You will not find a single statement in support of your sentimental gun lore. Not one.

If X is <i>not</i> a constitutional right, it is, at best,  a statutory right which can be revised, rewritten or rescinded; that means uzis are no more constitutional than mail order anthrax or other assorted but illegal esoteric weapons.
<BR><BR>
<li>
That the isolated quotes you provided, removed as they were from the context of any argument, constitute proof that the framers of your Constitution were not referring to guns in their communitarian milita function, but meant instead to say that the whole worth of their Constitution is in the individual's right to annul it according to the Second Amendment. After all, what good is a gun if you cannot pull the trigger whenever *you* feel personally tyrannized by the taxman? In other words, a Constitution which fails for lack of consideration in its function as the social contract it was expressly written to be.

Nor do I expect you to; none exists.<BR><BR>

There is exactly one US Supreme Court case that has addressed the scope of the 2nd amendment directly, and that case was <cite>U.S. v. Miller</cite> (in 1939).  In that case, the Court held that the 2nd amendment creates no constitutional right to own sawed-off shotguns, inasmuch as sawed-off shotguns have no legitimate use and especially have no use within the context of militias.<BR><BR>

That's it.  That's the one case.  And it didn't reach a pro-guns result.<BR><BR>

The same is largely true at the District and Circuit levels; that is, that pro-guns results have not been reached, not that there haven't been cases.  (The SCOTUS has exercised its discretion not to hear 2nd amendment cases; the lower courts don't have that option.)  Until two days ago, no Circuit court had ever held that the 2nd amendment ensconces an individual right (as opposed to a collective state right).  The case is <a href="http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/99/99-10331-cr0.htm"><cite>U.S. v. Emerson</cite></a>, and I don't suppose you've read it.<BR><BR>

You may like your theories.  By definition, they're the best ones you can imagine, because otherwise you'd be holding different ones.  You may think that the plain language of the 2nd amendment supports your theory and excludes all others.  You may think these things.  But the fact that you think these things and believe them with all your heart does not alter the fact that the courts have not sided with you.  They simply haven't.  When you say there have been several cases that support your position, you're at best misinformed and at worst outright lying.<BR><BR>

If you disagree with this result, then you should be actively agitating and bending the country's political will to your side.  The result exists, and you must confront it if you wish to change it.  By hiding your head in the sand and pretending the facts of the matter are something they are not, you are doing yourself and everyone you support a disservice. <BR><BR>

And worst of all, instead of educating yourself, you're arguing on the Internet with people who have done more research than you.  How can you hope to prevail if you're slobberingly misinformed?  <BR><BR>

That's a rhetorical question, by the way, so do not worry that of the many questions for which you have no answers, that this is one as well.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Wrong. No it isn't. Yes it did.<BR><BR>
In <i>U.S. v. Miller</i> Justice McReynolds writes that there is no evidence that a sawed-off shotgun<br><b>
"at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia."</b><br>
 which may lead a person to think that the Court views the Second Amendment as applying only to militias. Further reading reveals that<br>
<b>"certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense."</b><br>
which can be read to mean that the Second Amendment supports the right to own all sorts of exotic weapons, as long a they have a military application (rockets launchers and such). Note that nowhere in the decision does the court state that Miller could not seek protection from prosecution because the Amendment does not apply to individuals. Further, McReynolds writes<br>
<b>"the debates in the Convention, the history and legislation of Colonies and States, and the writings of approved commentators all show plainly enough that the Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense."</b><br>
which most definitely indicates that, despite the sexist connotations, the rights of <i>all males</i> to keep arms are protected.<BR><BR>
As I am sure you are comfortable with your ignorance of the remaining Supreme Court decisions that mention the Second Amendment, I won't bother to explain them to you. I will make mention of a few and if you are able I suggest you read them. Try <i>United States v. Cruickshank, 1875; Presser v. Illinois, 1886; B & Q.R.Co. v. Chicago, 1897</i>. The decision in the Dredd Scott case might even round out your education a bit.<BR><BR>
Regardless of whether you are able to mentally digest the cases I cite I cannot spend any more time on you. I must go earn more money to send to the GOA. Good evening.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I did not say that no other SCOTUS decision has ever mentioned the 2nd amendment.  What I said is that no other SCOTUS decision has addressed the scope of the 2nd amendment as to whether it protects individual gun ownerhsip.  <cite>Presser v. Illinois</cite> and <cite>US v. Cruikshank</cite> dealt with issues of federalism and only tangentially with the 2nd amendment (that whatever the 2nd amendment means, as part of the Bill of Rights it therefore only applies to the federal government).  If your intention is to expand 2nd amendment jurisprudence to permit of an individual's right to firearms, then it is curious that you would smugly declare victory when all you hold in your hands is two cases <em>restricting</em> the 2nd amendment's purview.<BR><BR>
<cite>Burlington & Quincy v. Chicago</cite> doesn't have anything to do whatsoever with the 2nd amendment, so why are you even bringing it up?  I'm equally baffled by your allusion to <cite>Scott v Sandford</cite>, since that case has everything to do with slavery and property law and nothing to do with the 2nd amendment; it's also perhaps the single most discredited opinion in the SCOTUS's history.  (And if you want to get into a battle of trivia and ephemera concerning Dredd Scott, then you'll likely lose.  First volley: the complainant's actual name was "Sanford", not "Sandford" as the title erroneously states.) <BR><BR>

Turning back to <cite>Miller</cite>.  It is one thing to declare what the 2nd amendment does not protect (owning sawed-off shotguns), and it is an entirely different thing to argue that this result necessarily compels your logic that the 2nd amendment protects everything that is not a sawed-off shotgun.  Even if we ignore the simple fact that your quote is dicta and not a holding in its own right, it still doesn't buy you your individualist gun rights model; McReynold's rhetoric stands for nothing more than that Congress may not disarm militias; it is entirely silent on whether states may disarm their own militias or whether the right to gun ownership under the 2nd amendment extends to private gun ownership.  To get that far, you have to present an argument such as the one I cited in <cite>U.S. v Emerson</cite>, which argues from first principles of original intent and common law.<BR><BR>

The SCOTUS has never in its history struck down an act of Congress or of any state legislature restricting firearms <em>on the basis of the 2nd amendment</em>.  The only times such laws have been struck down federal laws restricting gun ownership, it has been on the basis of other doctrines, such as federalism (<cite>Printz v. US</cite>) or the 10th amendment (<cite>U.S. v Lopez</cite>).  I challenge you to present a single SCOTUS case demonstrating otherwise. <BR><BR>

In accordance with your vitriol and childish insults and for reasons outline above, you remain as ignorant of the law as you do of rhetoric and civility.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

In the <i>Miller</i> case the decision does not state that the 2nd Amendment does not protect sawed off shotguns, it states that it does not protect sawed off shotguns because <i>they have no military application</i>, quite different from the former.

I must remind you: the dominant doctrine is not incorporation but <em>selective</em> incorporation.  It's an absurd doctrine driven by an absurd decision to strike the "privileges and immunities" clause from the 14th amendment in the <cite>Slaughterhouse</cite> cases.  It's the same doctrine that allows state juries to convict without a unanimous decision, and it's the same doctrine that allows states to get away with violating numerous constitutional liberties under the premise that states are held to a lower standard with respect to the Bill of Rights than is the Federal government.

<blockquote>Scott v Sandford mentions that as a test for citizenship one could consider whether or not a person was able to own firearms. Whether or not it has been discredited is beside the point, you don't throw out the barrel because you've found one bad apple.</blockquote>
You're reading far too much into it.  Apart from basing his holding in most part on other justifications, Taney here is describing common rights associated with citizenship but not necessarily of constitutional dimension.  The right to carry a passport inheres in citizenship, and whether a slave is categorically denied a passport is strong evidence that he is not a citizen, but there is no constitutional infraction if a passport is denied or restricted for a whole host of civil reasons.

<blockquote>In the Miller case the decision does not state that the 2nd Amendment does not protect sawed off shotguns, it states that it does not protect sawed off shotguns because they have no military application, quite different from the former. Had Miller been in possession of an M16 the decision would certainly not apply as written.</blockquote>

Even if your point is accepted for the sake of argument, it still won't buy you an individual right to gun ownership; at most, it says the Federal government has no place in regulating munitions suitable for the militia.

<blockquote>You acknowledge that the courts have struck down various laws on the basis of Federalism, yet neglect to mention that in nearly all cases the decision is essentially based on the meaning of the 2nd Amendment given Federalist thinking.</blockquote>

Certainly not for the cases I cited.  And I maintain the important distinction, though it be a fine one, between holding that "none of the Bill of Rights applies to the states" and "the 2nd amendment creates a right against the federal government concerning gun ownership but does not apply to the states".  <BR><BR>

You're grasping at straws to prove an assertion that cannot be proved inasmuch as it is false: that the Supreme Court has ever given teeth to the 2nd amendment.  <BR><BR>

Inasmuch as I am an avid proponent of individual gun rights, I find your efforts to champion the ideals that I hold dear to be intellectually bankrupt and counterproductive.  You're sitting on your laurels maintaining that the Supreme Court has already resolved the debate in our favor, when the plain truth is that they have done no such thing.  Perhaps the recent <cite>Emerson</cite> case will finally force their hand, but the SCOTUS has denied cert. to many more deserving cases.  It's a travesty, and you're doing nothing to help correct it.  And in the process, you manage to make the rest of us look like ignorant loons through your specious arguments and absurd logic.<BR><BR>

Get over it.  The authority of the SCOTUS is of no help here.  Erect your jurisprudence on firmer ground, or else you will always have to answer to Chuck Schumer's (correct) assertion that the Supreme Court has never recognized an individual's right to own guns (from which he concludes that it is perfectly constitutional to restrict individual gun ownership).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It's an old band name befor ethis ever happend. They have been callle ANTHRAX for over 20 years and YES it would do them damage to change their band name. It would be like starting over again. Doesn't matter if they put out a new album with good new music under a new name, they would not be reaching the mass fans that have been loyal to their favorite band since the early 80's. Its like a brand, which stands for quality and has it's loyal customers. Can you imagin Coca Cola changing their name? No, and I still have not seen 1 good reason for ANTHRAX to do so. 
<BR>

<BR>
I've just seen blind, ignorant, extreme, very religious people attacking a poor band who struggled so hard for 20 years, to just give up their name because of the tragedy and the current anthrax problem. That would meen the Terrorists are winning. They managed to inflict fear and made people fight each other and try to take freedom away from some. ANTHARX the band have a right to keep the name, which they deserve.
<BR>

<BR>
This does not mean they are unloyal Americans or Satanists. They are aware of reality, the difference of the real promlem & tragedy compared to the simple name of a band.
<BR>

<BR>
They are not guilty of anything. Without showing disrespect, the tragedy is not their personal problem. They are not to blame, they are not responsible, so why should they bend for those who dislike the word ANTHRAX? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you dislike the word Anthrax, close your eyes, not the eyes of others, for every individual is a free human being. Censurship is not the cure. Learn about the harsh reality and do what you can to help solve the problem. 
<BR>

<BR>
It's so unreal for me too see the logic that some American Christians have. They are so full of morals and the Bible's crap that it scares me. Radical lambs! It's the year 2001, and they act like its a witch burning, or the stoning of an unfaithful. Organized religion stinks and is the result of almost every war on this planet amongst humans, besides wars for land/power. Even then religion is used to fuel the war. 
<BR>

<BR>
I am Swedish, and believe some of you radical Christians should stop preaching about what is moraly right and grow up, look around in they year 2001, see reality, face the problems, the roots, the Terrorists!

These are hard times for the thrash-metal band Anthrax. Scott Ian, the lead singer, moaned to Washington Post columnist Lloyd Grove that "It's as if it's 1937 and I'm a bandleader named Freddie Hitler... maybe we should change the name. A friend suggested Basket of Puppies." Ian claims he has stocked up on Cipro, a medication said to be an antidote to the disease. "I will not die an ironic death," he said.

Why would such an irrelevant factoid matter unless one was so literal minded as to also believe that Scott Ian is seriously considering renaming the band "Basket of Puppies" and has stocked up on Cipro in his desire to not
 "die an ironic death"? Scott didnt make the point you raised, why did you? 
<BR><BR>
<i>They have clearly written that they are saddened by the events</i>

Furthermore, to pretend that they are doing so while this NYC based band - always has been - has been deeply influenced by the recent terrorist attacks to their hometown, is just plain... well let's say un-intelligent. In fact I'd like to talk in person to the people who wrote those stupid, ignorant, in-the-name-of-the-people's-sake-because-of-the-horrible-terrorist-attacks-pleas, to Anthrax because they truly are ignorants... Anthrax - the band - have been on avant-garde of metal scene for almost 2 decades, pioneers of THRASH-METAL, and RAP-METAL fusion (go check out Bring Da Noize w/ Public Enemy) and I still can't get over the fact that the dumbasses were shocked when they typed www.anthrax.com and found that there is a music band that bears that name... ooooo! you have to change it because bla bla bla... what's next?? Are we going to erase World Trade Center in all the old documents, web pages and etc., because it might remind some uptight urban know-it-all who obviously has too much time on its hands to come up with stupidities like the above mentioned posts. Please, before writing something, check out your facts! And they are: Anthrax are a long existing, popular (!) metal band!!! They should not, I repeat, SHOULD NOT, change their name just because it might be offending to someone. What about The Beatles ? They should have changed their name because it is offending to the bugs? Or were they cashing in on a horrendous bug-invasion in Africa? (notice the sarcasm)

Indeed, since they have been around for so long, they may have <i>inspired</i> these anthrax mailings with their hate-filled lyrics.  This isn't such a crazy theory.  Remember when those kids who listened to Marilyn Manson shot Christian students at Columbine High School?  How do we know that those perpetrating these anthrax mailings aren't fans of the band Anthrax?  In order to set a better example for children I think the band should not only change their name, but their lyrical content as well.  It's really just too dangerous to have these creeps singing about mailing anthrax to people even if they did change their name.

Before your ignorance clouds your judgement too much, perhaps you should stop and listen to the lyrics you claim are "hate-filled", "celebrating bio-terrorism", ever "inspiring" it.
<BR>

Many of their song lyrics are comical (ie. songs about drinking milk and coffee), others have songs that are anti-violence ("You're the coward with the gun...crazy sense of right and wrong" from "Random Acts of Senseless Violence", 1995) and anti-racist:

<BR>
Don't look at me as a white man

dmg and Mint Wlatman, among others, I would like you to read the above lyrics, as many times as it takes to figure out who is more ignorant...the band or yourselves.

Of course, in other lyrics, I can see why religious zealots would love to see Anthrax burned at the stake...take the song "Make Me Laugh", whose lyrics promote thinking for yourself instead of following religion blindly.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I realize adequacy readers are on the whole more intelligent than the vast majority of the sheep who make up the general population, but most people are too stupid to be trusted to 'think for themselves' and that is exactly WHY we have organized religion.<BR><BR>
The purpose of religion is to help the less intelligent people to behave sensibly, by scaring them, or encouraging them (the carrot and the stick). If we didn't have religion, most people would behave like wild animals, running around killing anyone they diagreed with.<BR><BR>
As an Atheist, I sure as hell am glad that those rednecks down south believe that 'thou shalt not kill', otherwise I would have been dead a long time ago.<BR><BR>
Think about it. Just because you are smart and have understood that religion is just about controlling the masses, does not mean that it is a BAD thing, its just not for you.<BR><BR>
As for Anthrax, they should change their name, get loads of free publicity, and when this furore has died down (which it inevitably will) they can get even more free publicity by changing their name back again.<BR><BR>
Everybody wins. The public is reassured, and Anthrax gets more CD sales which is what they are all about.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Folks, if you act nice to your fellow human beings because you're afraid of a hot red hell, I'm afraid you are already lost. You should be nice to other people because it feels good to do so.

I was not making an attack upon your religious beliefs whatsoever, I was making a mockery of your statement that a form of music, *ANY* form of music, should be made illegal. It's an art form whether you happen to like it or not. I've seen people offended because the statue of David is nude. Should we make nude statuary illegal, too? Shall we force people studying art and anatomy to place maple leaves and brassiers on their subjects for fear of offending someone? Yes, there is a comparison between the two, because when you boil both situations down, you are censoring something for absolutely no good reason. Oh my! It hurts my sensitive eyes! Guess what? It's not going to go away because you want to pretend it doesn't exist. If we act as though the World Trade Center never existed at all, does that mean the towers were never destroyed and nobody died? Of course not. Personally, I find the entire paranoia over anthrax incredibly puerile. How many confirmed cases have there been? Three? Four? Five at the VERY most, last I heard. Troubling, but nothing to panic over. Lastly, since when it is a proven fact that the band Anthrax, which has been in existence for around twenty years, is capitalising on human suffering? They are a thrash metal band. Metal is not a subgenre that drags in money by the bushel. People listen to metal, GENUINE metal, because they like the music and no other reason. If Anthrax were indeed called Basket of Puppies like Scott Ian remarked, I wouldn't care. Their music would be the same and would still appeal to me. Trying to force them to change their name because of current events is stupid, reactionary, and pointless. Do you understand, or should I repeat myself more slowly, in smaller words?
<BR>

<BR>
And by the way... I think my reading comprehension is a sight better than yours based on your gross misinterpretation of my point. Despite what you think, however, the world does not revolve around you and your likes and dislikes. Don't bother praying for me - God, unlike most of his creations, understands the right of the individual to walk their own path.

I am going to take a guess and say that the recent anthrax attacks have nothing to do with terrorists.
<BR>

<BR>
You people need to open your minds.  You are all such jaded fools... You've been living your easy lives cooped up inside too much... NEWS FLASH!  Lots of evil stuff goes on in the world.  Woohoo...  Change your name!  Mass Hysteria!  The terrorists are coming.
<BR>

<BR>
If anyone should be freaked out by this, it would be me.  I, until recently had an apartment about .25 miles away from the WTC, and I lost two friends in the attack (maybe more).  I used to go through the WTC everyday at around 9am...  If you guys start picking at every little thing because it in some way relates to to something that could possibly be linked to the terrorists, then the terrorists have whipped your ass.  How many New Yorker's out there think Anthrax should change their name?  I mean, sheesh, they have had that name for 20 years, I think they deserve it.  Lighten up a little eh?

Every report I've seen about these cases of Anthrax poisening has claimed that its the first case of Anthrax for a long time. I think the last case was in 1976, I could be pulling that date out of my arse but I remember that pretty much every report I have read indicated a date in the 70's.

Your ramblings on a subject in which you are clearly ignorant about, makes your "article" incredulous, transparent and sensationalistic. Otherwise known as *BAD MEDIA*. As a fan of this band and of free speech, I am just thankful that the same Constitutional Amendment that allows you to spew forth such idiocy will allow the band Anthrax to keep their name. No matter how many E-mails or letters you or your mindless, politically correct, soccer mom, PMRC minions feel like constructing, it won't have any legal bearing on this fine band changing their name. Good thing you are not in the demographic these guys are trying to sell records to, eh?
<BR>

<BR>
The fact that you "think" there is a *NEW* band named Anthrax, with a *NEW* CD entitled Spreading The Disease is laughable at best! The band has been named Anthrax for two decades and their so-called *NEW* CD, entitled Spreading the Disease, was released in the eighties. That is over a decade before the national threat of the disease Anthrax that we are faced with today! You couldn't possibly be any less informed about this subject, could you?
<BR>

<BR>
Here's an ironic observation about your diatribe that obviously escaped your and your editor's scathing wit and shrewd fact reporting ability. By your own admission, "Such overreaction makes us look stupid in the eyes of the world, and plays into the hands of those who would terrorise us." I believe this parodies your own point quite nicely since your overreaction to a simple band name makes you "look stupid". Hey, you said it.
<BR>

<BR>
Much in the same way you are urging others to crusade against the band Anthrax (who obviously has *NO* affiliation with the disease Anthrax), I urge the true intelligent and thoughtful people of the United States not to give into this bad media drivel. Our target as Americans should be the terrorists who appropriated these deeds against our great nation. We should not focus our frustration at a band that grew up in New York, a band who is also deeply saddened by these acts of terror and a band that was founded two decades ago that just happens to share the name of a deadly disease.
<BR>

<BR>
As a nation we need to refocus our attention and resources to the real problems instead of catering to sensationalistic media witch hunts and creating internal targets where there are none. Talk to your children more. Send aid to the charities benefiting the victims of these heinous acts. Do something constructive with your time, money and resources. DO NOT waste your efforts trying to needlessly tear down musical or entertainment avenues. After all, entertainment, compassion, motivation, strength, information (not opinion) and stamina will get us through these trying times. Responding to uninformed droning by a second-hand reporter wannabe like dmg, will get us absolutely nowhere.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The ironic thing here is that back in the 1980's (probably when you were watching Thundercats or something) there was a large battle against labeling records (those black vinyls things that were replaced by the sonically inferior tiny shiny CDs)  for adult content. Many of the then current heavey metal artists like Twisted Sister and Frank Zappa said it was the parents job to control what their kids listened to, not the government. You may not listen to me, but listen to your heavey metal idols like Frank Zappa and Dee Schneider.

As far as comparing me to the Taliban, I think they have a bad &lt;i&gt;rap&lt;/i&gt; in the US. Sure, they may go too far in some things, but they brought safety and security to the streets of Kabul. You can leave a Mercedes unlocked in downtown Kabul, with the keys in the ignition. Can you do that in the US? A woman may gave to wear the Burqaah to walk the streets, but she can walk the streets with no fear of being raped, can any woman in the US say that? Don't believe everything the secualr humanists on the nightly news say.<BR><BR><BR>

I don't even know where to start. A homosexual conspiracy? Perpetuated by... <i>Metal bands</i>? I'm not even sure how to respond to that. And your bit about people having it good under the Taliban again shows your extreme lack of realism relating to <b>anything at all.</b> I challenge you to find a Mercedes in Afghanistan. Women have to wear a Burqaah....and they can't go to school...and they can't have a job...and they can't *read*...and they can't go to the same hospitals as men...and they can't expose *any* part of their skin. Most of these, ahem, 'crimes' are punishable by DEATH.

You, Mr. Rightmann, sir, are the most ignorant person I have ever had the misfortune to come across.
<BR>

<BR>
I am amazed you've lived as long as you have.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm assuming that's more than 1.5 decades.
<BR>

<BR>
Of course, nobody's perfect.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt.
<BR>

<BR>
That is all.

Well, if they are walking down the street without a male guardian, they get whipped publicly. If they walk with a male guardian, but not of their family, they get whipped. If they are married and walk with a male who isn't family or their husband, they are stoned to death publicly. Sounds great. Sounds good. Oh, and what Mercedes? If you did live in Afghanistan and had a Mercedes, you are a very prominent figure and no one would mess with anything of yours or they would die. I think that's the same here, you know, if you see a really nice car down in a ghetto somewhere, I know I wouldn't touch it. Not all cars will be owned by someone really powerful, but it's enough of a chance that you would not touch it.
<BR>
As for you protecting your daughter, that is your right. But it is also your duty as a parent to educate her. I do know people that see girls like the one you are raising and think of ways to "break" them so that they become something that they weren't. They would normally try and "break" mormons, because when they "fall," they fall far. Your daughter needs more than to be just sheltered.

I remember the PMRC.  Those "heavey metal idols" as you refer to them wanted parents to be involved in their children's lives, not censorship (which appeared to be the ultimate aim of the PMRC).  I'm all for parents being involved in their children's lives, but there is a limit.
<BR>

<BR>
For the record, Frank Zappa never was a "metal idol" - he was an idol to be sure but he was never a metal guy.  Also you've forgotten the other member of that 'unholy trinity' - John Denver.  Are you going to start calling him a "heavey metal idol" too?

What do you allow your child to listen to? If you say anything like the usual Blink 182 or Nelly, or pretty much any pop music, you are a hypocrite. Heavy metal (by the way, it IS spelled heavy, not heavey...) is no worse for anyone to listen to than any of the sugar-coated music that pollutes our airwaves today.

The fact that you are defending the Taliban damages your credibility considerably. Furthermore, so does attacking a musical group because their choices conflict with your own.

Anthrax has been around for a very long time. Since the early 80's. Their name has nothing to do with the recent germ warfare and such. I feel that their statement on their website was tasteful. They made an unfortunate mistake by choosing a name that is a disease and they are not laughing at the victims in any way.
<BR>

<BR>
People these days simply need to pull their heads out of their arses and realize that we live in a very diverse world where open-mindedness is the answer to all of our problems. Open minds open doors. Open doors lead to opportunity. Simple as that. 'Nuff said.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

BANNING songs like bridge over troubled water by simon and garfunkel or imagine by john lennon from the radio to not offend anyone is very silly.  but to demand a band like anthrax, who has been playing music for almost twenty years, and quite honestly until you ALL brought them back hasn't been in the public eye all that much as of late, is absolutely preposterous.  why don't you all grow up.  while you are on here fighting a perfectly honest and hardworking band becaue you don't want to be OFFENDED your children are probably smoking crack or vandalizing street signs.  you are so caught up in how your life is affected and how you don't want to be offended you are ignoring everything else.  if everyone in this country stopped worrying about what everyone else was doing and worried about themselves and their families it would certainly be a better place.  the president did say all americans have to make sacrifices, but it shouldn't be an innocent band being forced to change their name but perhaps have more to do with bored housewives keeping their noses out of other people's business.  this is truly a tough time for all americans, why don't you do something constructive to help the cause and leave the band anthrax out of it?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anthrax is among the more intelligent metal bands, and have always been socially consious.  Theyw ere one of the first mainstream bands to deal with the subjects of homelessness ("Who Cares Wins"), racism ("Schism", "Keep It In The Family"), Native American rights ("Indians"), the fall of communism and the rise of democracy in eastern Europe ("One Man Stands"), and many many other issues.
<BR>

<BR>
They are NOT shock rockers.  They are just a heavy metal band (a very talented one) who are too intelligent to be content with singing about parties, girls, and drugs.  
<BR>

<BR>
You couldn't have picked a more inappropriate band to pick on because you are dead wrong in just about every sentence you wrote.  You even put them in the wrong genre'.  They aren't even close to grind-core or deathmetal.
<BR>

<BR>
This is the most blatantly stupid article i have read in a long time.  That's not an ad hominem.  To open one's mouth with such a rant while being clearly ignorant and incorrect on practically everything takes stupidity.

...and Anthrax haven't had long hair in a decade and a half!

You have thrown out assertion after assertion that have either been demonstrably false or have completely lacked proof.

I think it's been pretty clear by everybody here who actually KNOWS anything about the band that you not only do not know what you are talking about, but you don't even come close.  You're not even in the freaking ballpark.  
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't want to listen to them, that's fine.  We all have our tastes.  I personally think Whitney Houston has done more societal harm to this country than Anthrax ever has or will, but that's a different subject.
<BR>

<BR>
The point is, you don't have to listen to them.  But you should not tell lies about them.  You should be ENCOURAGING bands like Anthrax because they're intelligent and responsible.  If you actually knew anything about them, I think you'd find that you agree with more of their views than you'd disagree with.  But you wouldn't know because you never got farther than their name and an obscure album that's 18 years old.

It's a shame Anthrax isn't MORE popular.  They would bring back some much needed musicianship and social consience to a genre' that's in dire need of both.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

With all due respect, you have no clue as to what you're talking about. Your generalization that you use is just about as bad as the generalization that the terrorists used against all Americans on September 11th, the big difference being that you're using words and not violence, as far as I know. You make metalheads out to be narrow minded egotistical jerks, and while there are some, most of us aren't. Yes, Bach was great with musical theory, and in fact, I am known to sit back and listen to some Bach from time to time, but the fact is, Anthrax does in fact have some great musical talent, and if you aren't at least willing to think about that, then I pity you. Also, look at this attitude you sport towards people who don't agree with your religion, that they WANT to burn in hell. Have you ever thought for just one moment that people do have different beliefs, and they all have their own, in almost every case, rational reasons for those beliefs? It's that same attitude that you sported there also that caused the disaster on September 11th. So really, before you make yourself into any more of a mindless waste of skin, I reccomend that you actually think about what you're saying and at least try to make it sound rational.
<BR>

<BR>
And for the record, no, I wasn't the one who posted about burning in hell that you responded to, but I did feel the need to defend myself and many others who you offended with your mindless grabble. Jeez, and you call Anthrax offensive.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Because you have to understand the world of Hard Rock & Heavy Metal music first, and that is something you won't learn in the Bible. First, I'm not religious at all, I rather believe in myself and enjoy my life as much as possible before I grow old and die. Our "metal" music is more than your average polished happy pop on M tv. It's more than a religion, it's a lifestyle. Our music have been around for over 30 years, with many new related styles developing over the years. Many wonder why (and think) that metal bands are "evil" due to some bands having "evil" names or names linked to violence or aggression. Same for song titles. Well, not always, but if you listen to some of the more brutal music, thats were it gets it's name from. The ENERGY and POWER that comes out of the music. Some of us like it, and you have to accept that. There is a lot of mainstream music which some of us would call WIMPY or PATHETIC. But just the same, we have to accept others like that kind of music. Its that simple, different music for different tastes. You can't push your ideas, your music, your religion on others. Many people do, for they think they are so right and everything else is wrong. Just like the extreme Christians who fight metal bands. 
<BR>

<BR>
Death Metal bands,,,, the name is death and yes, the music is very brutal. Either you like it or not. As for the names of the bands and songs, its just that: names. Tehy write aggressive songs and have aggresive lyrics to match. It would be weird for them to have happy songs about flowers when the music is dark and heavy. Why dark and heavy? Because they feel like it, they have an intrest in those themes. That doesn't make them evil people. Its like enjoying a HORROR movie, are you evil for that? Or what about the authors of books/movies that go under the "Horror" catagory? Are they evil twisted people pushing a secret message from Satan to reader/film viewers? If you think so you are so confused, and I pity you. AMERICA is supposed to be about freedom, but it can't be with people who push their views & beliefs onto others. You are NOT always right, no matter what you beleive. So keep it to yourself if you have a pathetic opinion that suggests you are right and others so wrong. The Bible is not a guide to what is always right. The Muslims have their own books. I have my life and my music. I get so annoyed at seeing people like you calling people into metal for heroin users. Are all heavy metal people into drugs? Nope! In that case those who listen to Reggae must smoke weed. And Disco Ravers must be using Acid!? Fuck that! Censuring things will not solve anything either. 
<BR>

<BR>
I read that the band DREAM THEATER had to remove their no live album from stores and change the cover artwork. The album was called "Live Scenes From New York" and featured the New York skyline in the background with a burning red apple in the front. Now that apple's fire was right underneath the skyline, and some (idiotic) people get annoyed and force the band to change their cover so it has NO fire and replace the apple with a golden D.T. logo. Oh, so that's gonna make the problem go away!? They don't want people seeing something that will upset them or remind them of the tragedy. Censurship! Are people that weak? Accept reality and deal with it. A cd is a cd. Heavy metal is music, and to that style of music the bands can have whatever image, name and songs they want. Its a different issue from terrirism. Go after the enemy (the real threat) instead of attacking metal bands, or anything with the word "terror" or "war". 
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, I'm Swedish and live in Sweden, I'm so glad I'm not in your ignorant paranoid christian land right now! Make no mistake (pointing it out for the blind morons)... I'm no insulting America, just some of you radical idiots who are too religious and censur everything!

I listen to a wide range of metal from music that would make you cringe (Cannibal Corpse, Gorgasm, Dying Fetus, Skinless) to Anthrax, Slayer, Helloween, Megadeth, etc. etc. 
<BR>

<BR>
When Anthrax sings about death, satan, war, etc, it's in a cynical, sarcastic light. Of course, some closeminded bible thumpers can't grasp these concepts. Too bad for you.

<BR>
If you did, then you would realize that none of their songs are about satan, and the few songs that mention death are not about death per se, but rather the loss of a Grandparent (ie. "Bare"), or death as a result of social injustices (ie. "Random acts of senseless violence")
<BR>

<BR>
You're looking so hard to find satan and death in places where it doesn't exist.  Perhaps you should spend that energy embracing life and trying to find god.

PS - to dmg, thanks for the link to the bands email...I asked them NOT to give in to pressure from you and your ignorance, but rather to keep their name.  Changing it would only be giving up the freedom that terrorists wanted to take away from us in the first place.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Anthrax should not change their name. They are far from the stereotypical satanic metal as you can find. They are really intelligent musicians, they don't do drugs (they might drink some), they don't worhip satan, they don't flash around their long hair (what long hair, and in Scott's case, what hair?) and wear leather on stage. Here is some evidence to show you how they really are.
<BR>
They talk against violence, racism and communism.
<BR>
"One Man Stands" off the ablum Persistence of Time.
<BR>
"Freedom, taken for granted 'cause we don't know what oppression means.
<BR>
Freedom, taken for granted by the leaders who would crush the dream.
<BR>
A crack exposing human rights,
<BR>
light against a granite sky.
<BR>
A crack exposing human life.
<BR>
A fire burns.
<BR>
For the freedom
<BR>
Never given but taken.
<BR>
For the freedom
<BR>
Die for the Reason.
<BR>
One Man Stands, hard as he waits for freedom's hand, a unified voice for freedom of choice.
<BR>
One Man Stands for
<BR>
life,
<BR>
he'll give his, would you give yours to fight for a cause."
<BR>
Later in the song, they say this,
<BR>
"Free choice, religious freedom, basic rights are on the bottom line.
<BR>
Down with all the icons of the past cold war and detente. The flock no longer fears the wolf, the flock is taking what it wants."
<BR>
Sounds like they're against people being oppressed and they're for human rights. If any of you have seen the picture of the one man standing in front of a line of Communists tanks trying to enter a city, and reading that the tanks did not enter the city because one man stood to stop them. Did you feel American? Did you feel proud? Did you feel proud enough to write a song about it? I bet you didn't. But Scott Ian did. I think he's unAmerican, don't you?
<BR>
Here's another bad song by them.
<BR>
"The public enemy's not the man who speaks his mind
<BR>
the public enemy's the man that goes an cats blind.
<BR>
Searching for an answer that he'll never find."
<BR>
then in the same song,
<BR>
"Don't even try to tell me what you think is right,
<BR>
when to you blacks are niggers, and jews are kikes.
<BR>
and you expect to be taken seriously, but your actions, they're more than curiously juvenile. you emulate what you hate, and you don't even know why you feel this way. 'cause daddy hated this, and mommy hated that."
<BR>
I think they're against hatred. But that's in the song "Keep it in the Family" on the same Persistence of Time album, how about we skip to the song called H8 Red's closing words, "You may not know this, we may be different, different but equal, different and free."
<BR>
"Schism" from State of Euphoria, "Don't look at me as a white man.
<BR>
I'm just a man.
<BR>
Don't look at me as a black man.
<BR>
I'm just a man."
<BR>
That's 3 songs against racism. They're an evil band, they're telling people to be nice to each other.
<BR>
Then they do something bad, they want you to think for yourselves and have opinions in the song "Burst" off Sound of White Noise.
<BR>
"Kill someone, save a life.
<BR>
Don't do drugs, drink all night.
<BR>
Worship Jesus, praise Satan,
<BR>
Opinions are all contradiction.
<BR>
It's not a case of wrong and right.
<BR>
You may hate what I like.
<BR>
Vice versa, it's the same.
<BR>
Just do it, no pain no gain.
<BR>
Who cares what you expect,
<BR>
What is politically correct?
<BR>
All my ideas are in bad taste,
<BR>
get off my case and Judge yourself, no one else."
<BR>
But songs, you know, those are tough things, you have to read the lyrics or listen intently, let's go to what Scott said about the attacks the day after. "Even a stupid rock tour has to suffer.
<BR>
We're gonna go home." Then he finishes it w/ this.
<BR>
"My city has been raped. It's people murdered. Justice must be swift and uncompromising."
<BR>
In closing, this whole business about a petition to get them to change their name is pointless, but you have your right to do that and try to get them to change. I have my opinion that I want them to keep it the same.
<BR>
"Now I'm going to tell ya a story,
<BR>
a tale of wrong and right.
<BR>
and freedom is the reason,
<BR>
you can't take it without a fight.
<BR>

<BR>
So now I'm starting up a posse,
<BR>
to come and look for you.
<BR>
We're gonna put a stop,
<BR>
to what you want to do.
<BR>
You fuckin' whores
<BR>
that's all you are.
<BR>
You say our records are offensive.
<BR>
our messages ain't right.
<BR>
you say 'We're going to label records,
<BR>
so our kids can grow up right.'
<BR>
You fuckin' whores.
<BR>
That's all you are.
<BR>
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
<BR>
these 7 words you're trying to take.
<BR>
shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape.
<BR>
Right or wrong it's our choice to make.
<BR>
America the beautiful, land of the free.
<BR>
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy.
<BR>
Now I'm starting up a posse
<BR>
and we'll damn sure make you see
<BR>
something that offends you,
<BR>
may not be offensive to me.
<BR>
you fuckin' whores, that's all you are.
<BR>
Now you might take offense,
<BR>
to a word like 'fuck' or 'shit'
<BR>
but you fuckin' don't have the right,
<BR>
to disciminate against me for saying it.
<BR>
you fuckin' whores, that's all you are.
<BR>
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
<BR>
these 7 words you're trying to take.
<BR>
shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape.
<BR>
Right or wrong it's our choice to make.
<BR>
America the beautiful, land of the free.
<BR>
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy.
<BR>
So now I'm starting up a posse,
<BR>
to fight for freedom of choice
<BR>
to fight for freedom of speech,
<BR>
we're gonna make you hear our voice.
<BR>
And, now, I don't do this to shock you
<BR>
I don't do this for spite.
<BR>
You've got a choice don't buy it, don't read it,
<BR>
and don't say your opinion's right.
<BR>
you fuckin' whores, that's all you are.
<BR>
You know you can't censor my feelings,
<BR>
you can't censor my thoughts,
<BR>
censorship's against, everything america stands for.
<BR>
you fuckin' whores, that's all you are.
<BR>
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
<BR>
these 7 words you're trying to take.
<BR>
shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape.
<BR>
Right or wrong it's our choice to make.
<BR>
America the beautiful, land of the free.
<BR>
Don't change the words to land of hypocrisy."
<BR>
Well, I'm down with my rant. The above lyrics are from "Startin' Up A Posse" by Anthrax, it's on the album Attack of the Killer B's, uh oh, killer bee attacks are on the rise, better change that title too. And no one said anything about a more recent album, "Volume 8: The Threat Is Real" and on the inside cover is a fold out movie poster w/ the Anthrax members looking like cheesy action hero's w/ a city behind them being torn apart by giant spiders.
<BR>
russney@hotmail.com is a way to contact me, and I'm on Anthrax and Megadeth's message boards as Riehlthing.
<BR>
I won't even start on the Dave Mustaine comment.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You really have asked for it though when you ask for evidence. Whenever Antrhax are not worshipping Satan they are glorifying violence of one kind or another.<BR><BR>
I will let their lyrics speak for themselves.<BR><BR>


From the Album 'Reign in Blood' The track blasphemously entitled 'Jesus Saves'.<BR><BR>
<i>You have your own reality<br>
Christianity<br>
You spend your life just kissing ass<br>
A trait that's grown as time has passed</i><BR><BR>
Here we see that Anthrax are anti-christian.<BR><BR>
This track 'Necrophobic' contains the following disgusting lyrics:<BR><BR>
<i>Strangulation, mutilation, cancer of the brain<br>
Limb dissection, amputation, from a mind deranged<br>
Asphyxiation, suffocation, gasping for air<br>
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair<br>
</i><BR><BR>
Which proves Anthrax revel in torture and suffering.<BR><BR>
There's more: the track 'Reborn' contains this charming lyric in praise of Satanism and Witchcraft...<BR><BR>
<i>Incantation spell gone by<br>
I will live again<br>
My deals will made eternally<br>
I signed the book in red<br>
My rage will be unleashed again<br>
Burning the next morn<br>
Death means nothing there is no end<br>
I will be reborn </i><BR><BR>
As if this were not bad enough, they go on to glorify Naziism and Hitler's SS in a poor parody of Stephen King's novel 'Apt Pupil' (about a kid who is sexually aroused by stories of concentration camps in WWII. The track is entitled 'A Skeleton In The Closet'<BR><BR>
<i>
All American, an evil game of extortion</br>
A sick old man, and who would guess<br>
He was once S.S.<br>
A deadly fascination, of a madman's solution<br>
Six million dead, poison tales pollutes his head</i><BR><BR>

More death from the track 'NFL'<BR><BR>
<i>Wake up dead in a plywood bed<br>
Six feet from the rest of your life
</i><BR><BR>
Glorifying mindless violence: from the track 'Armed and Dangerous'<BR><BR>
<i>Am I evil, or am I insane<br>
The lion inside of me, is no longer tame<br>
A blade in my left, a gun in my right<br>
To beat you within, an inch of your life<br>
</i><BR><BR>
More pointless glorification of violence from the track 'Gung Ho'<BR><BR>
<i>
Raging on the warpath, storming through the town<br>
Blowing it to pieces, killing all around<br>
Stand in our way, if you've got the balls<br>
In a hail of bullets, your nailed to the wall
</i><BR><BR>
Yet more obscene glorification of violence from the track 'Random Acts of Senseless Violence
'<BR><BR>
<i>Random acts of senseless, random acts of senseless<br>
Random acts of senseless, random acts of senseless
Violence<br>

I see something wrong and I fix it with my hands<br>
I walk a thin blue line, this cross I came to bear<br>
I see something wrong and I fix it with my hands<br>
I walk a thin blue line and I'll be the one who laughs when,<br>
You die
</i><BR><BR>

Yet more senseless violence, are you starting to see a pattern here ? from the track 'killing box'<BR><BR>
<i>A piece of you burns every time you like<br>
So lets start a war, just to see how many die</i><BR><BR>
And perhaps the most reprehensible track in view of the senseless slaughter we are currently inflicting on innocent Afghanis: from the track 'Death from Above' Anthrax happily glorify the slaughter of innocent Muslims unlucky enough to live in Afghanistan.<BR><BR>
<i>No reason, no warning<br>
Nor shadow be found<br>
Got you in my sights<br>
And I'll shoot you down<br>

Jet fighter, jet fighter<br>
Turbo jet engines ignite<br>
Jet fighter, jet fighter<br>
Death will filling the sky<br>
Jet fighter, jet fighter<br>
An airborne assault and attack<br>
Jet fighter, jet fighter<br>
A cold blooded stab in the back</i><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
DO YOU WANT ME TO GO ON ?????
<BR><br><i>time to give a Newtonian demonstration - of a bullet, its mass and its acceleration.</i><br>

Many of these songs are anti-war and anti-violence.  Are they promoting violence by talking about it?  Then you would be guilty of that too.
<BR>
In fact, this whole thread is promoting violence and hatred, because that is all the ignorant people seem to have on their minds.

<BR>

<BR>
Here are my issues
<BR>

<BR>
1.  Anthrax has been around since the early 80's, how did they know this was gonna happen.  They had no way of knowing, so for you to criticize them is totally wrong.  
<BR>

<BR>
2.  Those lyrics you posted are all screwed up.  first of all reign in blood is from slayer, not anthrax.  Also  not all heavy metal bands are satan worshipers.  Did you know Dave Mustaine is a christian.  What about the christian heavy metal bands, i guess they are satanic too.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  Metallica wrote a song called master of puppets, it is all about how bad cocaine is.  because they wrote about it, does that mean they endorse it..NO.  How about brittany spears "hit me baby one more time" is she endorsing for females to get beat, why dont you go bark up her tree.
<BR>

<BR>
Get all the facts straight before you comment on this.  I also believe that some of what you wrote here can be taken as slander.  I will be sure to forward this on to anthrax.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
a)"reign in blood" is by the band Slayer, an openly satanist band, and even so, what is it to you? your not listening to their music.
<BR>
b)antrax came out, with that name mind you, in 1981, a good 20 years before the whole Sept. 11 tragedy. This was in the article on the website, but you, like many other conservative hypocrites, fail to provide all the information.
<BR>
c) About not being religious, the guitarist, Scott Ian, is jewish and proud of it.
<BR>
d) they have not produced an ablum since Sept. 11, so they did not right any of thier lyrics in spite of this tragedy. In fact, they are even doing a benefit concert with other "satanic" bands
<BR>
d) stop whining over a trivial matter of a bands name, and start doing something productive with yourself.

Listen:

Anthrax was formed AND NAMED in the EARLY 80s. "Spreading the Disease" was an album released in the late 80s, and if you would take half as much time to look into the album & band as you did slamming them on this site, you would have realized this, as well as the fact that NONE of the songs on said album deal w/ bioterrorism, much less "praise" it.

Your assertion that their music is 'aggressive' certainly does not surpise me. But I think New York, and indeed the rest of the USA has had enough 'aggression' in the past month to last it a lifetime.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I came across their mission statement:
<BR>

<BR>
"There are a number of people who have opinions that don't quite fit the norm. Because of this, they aren't welcome many places. This is where they exercise their right to speak, where the dreams of tomorrow take flight today.
<BR>
This site is aimed at middle class white male professionals - the sort of people who have been sadly sidelined by todays victim culture, and the domination of homosexuals, geeks, amputees, racial minorities and Canadians, who have all risen up with their discrimination laws and 'equality' to sadly control the media agenda.
<BR>
These people are not welcome here. This is where we make a stand. This is where we fight back. 
<BR>
It is also squarely aimed at the marginalised of society -- homosexuals, geeks, amputees, racial minorities and Canadians, who remain in a state of oppression, kept down by the dominant white male patriarchy and by insufficiently rigorous 'discrimination' laws and the corporate media. 
<BR>
These people are welcome here. This is where we make a stand. This is where we fight back.
<BR>
Controversial opinions, passionately held. We Are Adequacy.org."
<BR>

<BR>
Isn't it rather ironic than that dmg's post favors censorship, restricting the freedom of speech "to sadly control the media agenda", and taking a rather conservative right-wing stance rather than a "Controversial opinion".

<BR>

<BR>
For the record I would like to say I am not really an Anthrax fan, their music is good for what it is but it's just not for me. That said, this isn't some sort of "trying to protect my band" reaction.
<BR>

<BR>
For all of you so-called grown ups I would like you tell you that you aren't acting very grown up. For one, take responsibility in your research and reporting. If you want to report something do complete research and speak factually. You had many facts wrong, which many people have pointed out.
<BR>

<BR>
Anthrax has been around for 20 years, and "Spreading the Disease" has been around since the 80s. No one had a problem with it then, but then again Anthrax the disease wasn't really around. Most people who hear the word Anthrax associate it with the band because the disease is so completely rare. If you've been watching the news, until last week there had not been an anthrax related death since the 70s. 
<BR>

<BR>
Scott Ian, the band's singer and founder, got the name in biology class in highschool. He thought it sounded very "metal" which it does in my opinion. Check out the other metal band names and compare. Anthrax fits right in. You don't have to like the genre, but this is like kindergarten, you look and see what matches and what doesn't. Anthrax matches that genre's style of names. 
<BR>

<BR>
And besides that fact, the band already feels REALLY bad about this. They aren't being jerks and going "We're gonna profit off this." Scott Ian compares this to WW2 era and saying it would suck right then if he was a band leader named Freddie Hitler. He would really want to change the name. Right now, they are deciding if they want to change it or not. It's a very sensitive time and they are taking it seriously. 
<BR>

<BR>
As for some idiots out there claiming Anthrax is unAmerican... hello what country do you live in? America is about freedom. America means you can say whatever you want to without fear of persecution. If you insist on censoring then you make this country something it's not. YOU make it unAmerican. Our founding fathers would look at you people and be ashamed. If you want to live in a country where everything is monitored and people aren't allowed to say anything 'wrong' then you should move to a country like Afghanistan where life is very strict and they have rules about these things. If you want to live in a country where freedom is paramount then stay here and accept everyone and BE TOLERANT of all. 
<BR>

<BR>
Just because you don't like a particular name or a type of music does not make it wrong. It is their choice to make music, and it is your choice not to listen to it. Make that choice.
<BR>

<BR>
You don't know Anthrax, and obviously you did not research this or else you would know better. Hell I don't know Anthrax, never met them, but I did read up on them, and I've heard about them through the years. I do know they seem like good people, good Americans, and in a very tough situation. 
<BR>

<BR>
Instead of wasting your time trying to point fingers at a harmless band that you didn't care about until a few days ago, who did nothing but have a name for 20 years without incident, why don't you try being productive? Do some charity work, enlist in the military, or even just live your life peacefully. You know none of you would care or even know about the band Anthrax if instead of anthrax people were spreading around small pox or something. Think about it.

This is the kind of thing we Americans need to ban from our land of the free.

They are doing little more than profiting on the suffering of victims of bio-terrorism by releasing the disgustingly titled 'Spreading the Disease' in spite of recent events.  Well, I say it's time for us good, decent Americans to take back our country and our culture from rock-metal bands.  I hate to imagine an impressionable member of the church youth group I lead put down their Michael W. Smith or DC Talk albums and instead listen to the hate and vitriol espoused by these creeps.  I imagine they might think it makes them look 'cool' in front of their peers, but it doesn't.  It makes Jesus weep.  
<br><br>
In order to prevent the above from EVER happening, I have mobilized my youth group to spread the news that these terrible people think our FEAR and ANXIETY over bio-terrorism is something to make light of.  We have begun going door-to-door to talk to mothers of teenagers who might be tempted to buy an Anthrax album, or worse, already own one.  We have also writen many letters to our local paper outling many of the points dmg made in his informative article, and plan to protest ANY record store that continues to sell Anthrax albums despite their reprehensible behavior.
<br><br>
In addition to the above, I have organized a burning of Anthrax albums to take place later this week in the field outside my church.  All are welcome, and those who wish to come over to the good side may do so by exchanging an Anthrax album to be burned later for a Bible.
<br><br>
I urge all of you to take similar actions in your part of this great, God-fearing nation.  This country was founded by conservative Christians and God willing it will soon return to that former glory! <BR><BR></FONT></td>

The more you try and act against the band, the more free publicity they will get...so personally, I thank you for bringing more attention to a great band that hasn't had much press lately.  With your "album burnings", more people will be curious, and they'll get to hear some of the best albums put out in the past decade.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Let's start with "Who Cares Wins,"
<BR>
it's about homeless people being the unseen population and to bring awareness to them.
<BR>
How about "The Enemy," it's off the album Spreading the Disease that came out in 1985 and is about Hitler. It talked about how much of a coward he was by committing suicide so he wouldn't face his crimes.
<BR>
Let's then have "N.F.L." A song about drug use ruining the life of a musician and that his life was a waste, or, the real title, "Efilnikufesin," nisefuckinlife.
<BR>
How about "Burst," a song to make you think for yourself and don't judge people. Better watch out for the evil men. They might want you to think and lift your head up out of your bible.
<BR>
I would like to ask you a question, you probably don't want to hear it though.
<BR>
The bible was written a long time ago, it's been translated a lot of times right? Hebrew to Latin to German to English. How many mistranslations do you think there are? Also, think about this, floods. Greeks had a flood in mythology, Romans had one too, many Indian tribes did too, Bible has a flood. I bet there was a flood. Did you know the only cultures that didn't have a flood in their culture were either reknown great sailers or were severly land locked? Makes you wonder about that, doesn't it? What if the bible is just another mythology, but written down. How come the Romans kept track of almost everyone during their time. How come Jesus wasn't kept track of. How come the first we heard about him was 30 years after his death?
<BR>

<BR>
Well, closing this one up. You can all reach me at russney@hotmail.com or Riehlthing on the Anthrax and Megadeth message board. Oh, by the way, I'm a Lutheran that lifted his head up out of the bible.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The normal people in this country can distinguish between a music genre and the real world. I think that you are forgetting that this country stands for freedom.  Freedom of speech (which includes music), freedom of press (which is why you get to post your neo-Nazi thoughts here) and freedom of religion (which means that all people are free to practice whatever religion they believe in and not have to worry about being persecuted for it).  You have trashed all three of those freedoms in your post.
<BR>

<BR>
It scares me that you are allowed to influence young people with your facist and Nazi-esque views.  Burning albums?  And a mighty Sig Heil to you too... Are you planning on a book burning the following week?  Perhaps starting with the Qaran?  Then you could lock up anyone who looks like they might be from the Middle East, then work your way through the rest of the immigrants in this country and finish it off with a might burning at the stake of all the Liberals.  Sounds like a busy month for you.

<BR>
Why don't you just realize that it's a band name.  A name they have had for about 20 years.  It's just a name.  I can't believe that in this day and age that there are still some people who are as narrow minded as you are and that you are so threatened by a band name. 
<BR>

<BR>
Personally, I emailed Scott Ian of the band Anthrax and told him that if they decided to cave in to this madness (which I'm sure they won't) they should rename their band Smallpox, Botulism, Plague, or Mustard Gas.  I would hate for you to have nothing left to do if they changed their name to "Basket of Puppies".  Better yet, why don't you mobilize your youth group (geez that still sounds a little Nazi-like) and give blood or hold a bake sale to raise money for the victims of this tragedy?  Why waste so much energy being negative when you can do positive things to help others?

Invoking my right to protest what I see as immoral is tantamount to fascism?  This statement simply reveals the weakness of your agrument.  YOU would like to silence ME.  YOU are the fascist if anyone is.  All I, along with the intelligent contingent of the internet's most controversial website, am doing is calling upon Anthrax to show some decency, not cease making music.  Plus, your equating my religion with hate-crimes is thourghly disgusting.  I have not made one mention of Islam, the Qaran or immigrants from the Middle East.  No doubt you would be enraged if I said Islam is to blame for terrorism.  How is your equating my beliefs with hate-crime any different.  All of this came from you, and the axe you obviously have to grind with organized religion.  This pale attempt at setting up a strawman argument is bad form, and deserving of censure.

Wrong.  This would not take anyone's rights away.  All would be free to practise whatever religion they choose- even the Catholics.  This stands in stark contrast to today's social/political atmosphere were being a decent Christian could be dangerous to your health.  There are many who won't be satisfied until Christians are once again thrown to the lions.

Go ahead and organize your album burning, if that helps you to deal with your misplaced anger from the events of Sept. 11.

What happened to everyone else's right to buy Anthrax albums?  If you don't like it, don't buy it, don't listen to it.  Their music isn't really considered mainstream and you're not likely to hear it on whatever Christian radio station you listen to so why does this even interest you.  
<BR>

<BR>
Most of the normal people in this country understand that it's just a band name.  They are not cashing in on any tragedy, they had the name before the psychos started using it as a weapon of terror.  As far as my email to Scott Ian, I can see that a sarcastic wit (hell, any wit) is totally beyond the comprehension of your small mind.
<BR>

<BR>
You did get one thing right, I am against organized religion.  It is set up to alienate people rather than to lift them up.  Organized religion is the basis of many wars and atrocities against humans.  The fact that you mentioned your "Christian youth group" and "burning albums" in the same sentence proves that.  Censorship is where the Nazis started.  They burned those books which did not agree with their philosophy.  You're doing the exact same thing.  What right do you have to impose your religion and YOUR morals on everyone else?  Why should Anthrax change the name that they have had for more than 20 years just to please you?  What difference will all of this make in another 20 years.  There are a lot more relevent battles to fight, but making a band change their name just because it now happens to be associated with terrorism is small minded, petty and ridiculous.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I am urging everyone on this site to NOT, I repeat NOT partake in this absurd farce to try and get the heavy metal band Anthrax to change their name in light of recent events.  In a world today changed because of the events of September 11th, you are mistakenly aiming your efforts to bring about a change at the wrong target.
<BR>

<BR>
I am a 27 year old college educated productive member of society.  What's more, I am one of the soldiers overseas protecting your country so people like yourself have the right to partake in such tomfoolery as this.  Since you are writing this column in honor of "our men and women fighting overseas", I refuse to have my name and that of my fellow soldiers used for such a disgraceful and wrong purpose.  
<BR>

<BR>
I am appalled at your completely unfair and totally uneducated attempt at getting Anthrax to change their name.  The main reason for my disdain is because of your COMPLETE and INEXCUSEABLE lack of research on the issue.  The saddest part of your assault on them was that all the information you needed to avoid this waste of cyberspace was right in front of your eyes in the quotation you pulled directly from the website.  
<BR>

<BR>
I don't know who any of you are and I won't judge you as naive or culturally inept with your lack of knowledge of the band Anthrax heretofore.  I do not expect you to be able to name their songs or bandmembers verbatim the way I can, and I understand that because of it you are at a distinct disadvantage.  However I do feel it my job to inform you of your gross inaccuracies about the band unfairly portrayed in this waste of cyberspace you refer to as a "petition".  
<BR>

<BR>
These are the TRUTHS about the band ANTHRAX, whom I have been listening to since their inception.  
<BR>
**Note: Please understand that in no way is my opinion biased because of my enjoying their music--I would have gladly defended, say, Wayne Newton if you had lambasted him so attrociously.  
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX is NOT a "grind core" band.  They play 
<BR>
 heavy thrash-metal.  By pigeonholing them as a   different genre of music than they actually play, 
<BR>
you set the stage for the further fallacies to come.  
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX is NOT a "devil-worshipping" band.
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX grew up in New York, still live there, 
<BR>
 and know a hell of a lot more about the true 
<BR>
 brevity of the events on September 11th than you
<BR>
 may think!
<BR>
 
<BR>
-ANTHRAX is not a band of carefree rockstars who 
<BR>
 pose about in lavish luxury as you portray--rather quite the  contrary.  I have met guitarist Scott Ian in  person in Connecticut a few years ago, and can   attest he is a gentleman in spite
<BR>
 of his rock-star status you claim as a shortcoming. The band has performed with Afro-American musicians outside of their genre in an effort to promote racial harmony within the ranks of rock music.  The band has also 
<BR>
 performed charity concerts for the homeless, 
<BR>
 their cause-celebre, on a regular basis--even 
<BR>
 performing a song about the homeless in and 
<BR>
 around their New York on their "State of 
<BR>
 Euphoria" album called "Who Cares Wins".  You may
<BR>
 also find it interesting to note that the band does not drink or do drugs of any kind, and promotes a drug-free lifestyle.
<BR>

<BR>
-And above all, and most the most blatant         misrepresentation in your calvacade of faux-pas is the fact that ANTHRAX, the band you erroneously refer to as a "new" band, has actually been around since the days of New Coke, DeLoreans and Reaganomics.  Infact, the so called "new" album you referred to as the most offensive, "Spreading The Disease", was actually in existence since--gasp!!--1985!!
<BR>

<BR>
I will tell you to save your breath, because your pleas will fall on deaf ears.  The band has decided to stick to their name.  And why shouldn't they??  Hasn't any of the last few weeks taught you anything about the scare-tactics??  The ritualistic name-changing of a band will do little to curb the already minute threat of Anthrax (the disease) in our country.  All it will do is feed the Taliban press or whatever sick faction is responsible for this, with further ammunition to appease their die-hard ranks, and help them believe that they are winning the war against America.  President Bush insisted Americans continue on living our lives as before, and I would liken this suggestion on your part to the recent decline in travel due to people avoiding airplanes--once again, positive feedback for the enemy's front.  What's more, as I've clearly shown above and any researcher truly worth their salt can plainly see, the band ANTHRAX has predated the current scare that bears the same name by two decades.  And your lameattempts to re-name the band (Aunt-Wax??  COME ON!!) are about as mealy-mouthed as the information you posted on this site.
<BR>

<BR>
I say again--as a soldier defending your country, I am ashamed at this aberration of the First Amendment.  Your attempt to undermine this band, spearheading them as an accomplice in the insidious events of the past few weeks, let alone the past month is nothing more than a smear campaign.  
<BR>

<BR>
I am cc'ing this letter to the ANTHRAX fan email to let them know about this ridiculous petition, and am urging everybody to disregard this ludicrous petition as rubbish.  The fact remains that ANTHRAX the band had nothing to do with the recent outbreaks.  Their name is nothing more than an ironic coincidence.  And to the author of this shameless smear campaign, I urge you to research your facts thoroughly before you post any information on the internet or any other medium under the guise of a well-learned source.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, I AM a conservative, believe in Jesus, and have taken the Lord into my heart as my savior.  Unlike you, sir--I choose to not use my religious leanings as an excuse to ascend a soapbox.  Enjoy your record burning, and I along with the members of ANTHRAX will happily rejoice at the added linings to their pockets because of the albums you so foolishly purchased!!

Hello, I'm writing from Germany. We truely feel with all americans who lost relatives and friends. But I, and among a lot of others, do NOT feel for misguided "Bible-Belt terrorists", who think that they can blame rock-bands for crashing down the two towers of the WTC or even more ridiculous, spreading the disease, just because that's their title of a CD released in 1985. Maybe these are the same people killing doctors who procure abortion. 
<BR>
When this affair comes into European press, I tell you that there will be a lot of laugher because of the stupidness and ignorance of some americans. We believe in almost the same things as you, but sometimes we have to laugh..
<BR>
Everytime an American sues a company because he has spilled some coffee or something and gets 4 million dollars, we have to laugh.
<BR>
But let me tell you that no one laughed as these two towers crashed, no one. Hell, these people sueing and whining are just leaving us no other opportunity... 
<BR>

<BR>
But I don't know if I now have to laugh or to weep. Because this is just too ridiculous. Do something useful, as I, cause I note that I waste my time on this and I've got to finish these declaration.

oh wait. they have had that name for about 20 years. anf that cd came out in 1985. yeah. they are definitely trying to profit off of this. what the heck are you thinking? someone always has to try to blame someone for something that they had nothing to do with. i don't understand people. you are attacking someone you have never met, talked to, or even read about, and telling people to burn cd's of this band? why didn't you do this a year ago? they had the same name. anthrax the powder stuff caused the same problems. but they didn't have to change their name then. they just have to do it now because it "offends" people.

<BR>
it is right wing conservative people like yourself that still plague this country. it is people that you that will not accept people for their differences and thus cause prejudice. its people like you that call for the racial discrimination against other races, religions, and sexual preferences just because they are different. maybe if you could sit down for about an hour and expanded your mind about topics, you wouldn't be a loser. 
<BR>

<BR>
the fact that this topic is coming up 21 years after they formed, is stupid. why don't you go tell elton john to change something about himself since he is openly gay and that "corrupts the minds of your children?" get a life. i don't know where you think you have this authority to tell a person to change their name. how about this. your first name is Mint. i personally hate the flavor mint, so i want you to change your name right now cuz it offends me and causes me to vomit everytime i think about it. 
<BR>

<BR>
also you talk about god and christians. first of all this country is not catholic. the main focus of America is freedom. that includes freedom to practice any religion and also free speech. just because our president is catholic and he talks about "GOD" in all his address, doesn't mean that the country has a designated religion. it is kind of like the language of this country. there is none because there is a diverse number of groups in this country, that you cannot force people to speak a certain language. that is not freedom, that is slavery. 
<BR>

<BR>
i really couldn't care less what you manipulate your youth group to do. don't try to persuade a group of musicians to change their name they have had for 20+ years just because you are offended by it. it you don't like it then you don't have to listen to the music. its as simple as that. they do not create the disease nor promote it. its a name, get over it. do you want jefferson airplane to change their name just because planes crashed into the twin towers? i wouldn't think so. i rest my case. leave the band alone and learn to do extra research on things before you shoot off your mouth about something that you boviously have no clue about. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

They are not sending anthrax in envelopes and they were deeply affected by the tragedies on 9/11 as we all were.  They are not trying to capitalize on the recent events, they are just being who they always have been, one of the best and most influential metal bands of all-time.  I've met them before, and they are just regular guys who like to have a good time and make great music.  It's sad to see people attack them for something they are not guilty of.  I am also a CHRISTIAN, but I'm tired of seeing certain Christians trying to make enemies and fight with people who are more innocent than they are, and claim to be holier than thou with all the answers.  We are all human, and nobody's perfect, but claiming that ANTHRAX has recorded 13 albums since 9/11 is ridiculous and starting ralies to burn their albums is completey insane.  They are just a band that diserves our respect and our sympathy especially in a time like this (Some of them actually reside in NYC).  They should not be condemned for something they never intended to do.  How would you like it if you had a three year old son named OSAMA, and everyone who knows you and doesn't know you or anything about you, began demanding in public that you change your son's name, because they claim that you are just trying to get attention from the events of 9/11.  Open your eyes and your minds, and get your facts straight before you make these untruthful statements.  Leave ANTHRAX (the band) alone, and God Bless America.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

That is what Anthrax sings about.  If they don't mind, I'll borrow a little quote from them:
<BR>

<BR>
"I'm gonna tell you a story,
<BR>
A tale of wrong and right,
<BR>
And freedom is the reason
<BR>
you can't take it without a fight

to what you want to do

<BR>
You fucking whore
<BR>
That's all you are"
<BR>

<BR>
ad nauseum.  It's the greates anti-censorship song ever written.  You should thank the great country that provides them with the freedom to sing that song, because it also provides you with the freedom to PURCHASE their albums so you can burn them.

<BR>

<BR>
Let me introduce you to the two biggest enemies of a true journalist: slander and libel.  Slander, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is "the utterance of false charges or misrepresentations which defame and damage another's reputation".  Libel, also according to Merriam-Webster, is " 1.)a written or oral defamatory stement or representation that conveys an unjustly unfavorable impression 2. a) a statement or representation published without just cause and tending to expose another to public contempt 2. b) defamation of a person by written or representational means".  Now, journalists who pride themselves on integrity and credibilty take special care to not venture into the unethical realms of slander and libel (much how you guys avoid Sodom and Gomorrah). 
<BR>
DMG, you made reference to your use of the Internet as a research tool; however, you apparently didn't have the presence of mind (or desire to double-check your research) to recognize that a quick trip to CDNow.com or amazon.com or any other website that sells music CD's would have given you the correct historical band info as well as their discography.  I'm all for free speech, but it saddens me to think that there are people like you trying to pass biased rhetoric rife with falsehoods off as factual information to a group of people who are uninformaed and could benefit from an accurate and complete story.  
<BR>
Without getting into a spitting contest about citing specific cases, if memory serves correctly, this type of reporting does meet the criteria for libel.  There is a plain and clear intent to defame the band Anthrax.  Regardless of whether you are a fan of the band or not, I would hope that there are other readers out there who are passionate in their pursuit for honesty, accuracy and integrity in the media that we so desperately depend on for information.  You see, when we no longer expect our journalists to be true and ethical, they will no longer be journalists but propagandaists.  (Recall the German newsreels about the "work-camps" circa WW2).  Please, please, Adequacy.org, change your tagline to "Propaganda for Grown-ups", because your operation is far from a legitimate news group.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The members of the band Anthrax are celebrities n&eacute; plus ultra.  As celebrities, Anthrax must meet a higher standard (actual malice) to prove libel than would non-celebrities (who must only show that false statements were made and harm was incurred).  See <cite>Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts</cite> and <cite>Associated Press v. Walker</cite>.<BR><BR>
So even if we accept your critique of dmg's reporting (which we need not and should not do), your accusation of libel is groundless.  Inasmuch as dmg is a private individual governed by the standard articulated in <cite>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.</cite>, you yourself should be wary of committing libel with these accusations.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The image of metal bands as influential groups of satan-worshippers is too imprinted in their minds to even consider the concept of a socially conscious and critical band that uses the word 'satan' repeatedly or is atheistic. All they see is that near-religious symbol and react accordingly.

It's useless to plead them find out what this band is about. You can validate your point with a shower of facts, but they still won't listen. Their view on things is so set they'll never doubt themselves wrong. Faith is doubtless belief. Easy to apply to many more things than the holy babble.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I agree that if we give in and change stupid little things in our daily life, we are just giving in to terrorism.
<BR>

<BR>
Why don't we just delete everything offensive? How about they change their name to "Kiss My Ass" or "Mind Your Own Damn Business"?
<BR>

<BR>
They have had the name Anthrax for many years, and Dave Mustaine has absolutely nothing to do with the band, except that his band toured with them for HALF of last year. If you knew anything at all about what you are talking about you would also know that the actual man "insulting the record buying public with his irredeemable horrifically tasteless posturing" as you put it is Scott Ian, who happens to be bald. 
<BR>

<BR>
I am not a huge fan of Anthrax, but you need to at least get your facts straight before making a post about what someone else should or shouldn't do.
<BR>

<BR>
I happen to be on a HAZMAT Response Team in a major US city. Our Anthrax run volume has gone through the roof over the past two weeks. Every single run has been from some uneducated person letting their imagination run wild. We all have to be careful, not scared. 
<BR>
There is a guy here that is now facing a 20 year sentence for leaving an envelope of a white powder that is used every day in their shop, on his buddy's desk. He expected to be there when it was opened on monday, but his buddy worked on saturday and found it. The prankster was notified by phone and immediately told what he had done. Although that was horribly bad timing on his part, 20 years seems a little like overcompensation to me. "We can't get the one's that actually did this, so let's just get who we can" mentality. That's the same mentality it takes to petition a Thrash band to change their name because YOU feel it's offensive. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't like the name or the music, all you have to do is ignore it. Don't buy their CD's & don't go to their shows!
<BR>

<BR>
Don't bother trying to argue with me about the Constitution or Morals or Religion. Frankly I don't have the time, and very little that you have to say has any merit to me at this point. KingV<BR><BR></FONT></td>

To the guy who said he would only let his kids listen to anthrax if they did and accoustic tour and played handel, who cares what you think, most metal bands are pro-America, go to some sites you will see that they are having anti-Bin Laden statements and showing condolences from the attacks, and if you would actually read closely to the article on their site they say that to even be associated with the terror makes them feel bad and they arent changing their name because they feel there is no need too because they hope there are no more cases of anthrax.

I know everyone has to blame something or complain about something related to this, but how in the world is the name of the band Anthrax hurting you or offending you so much that you want them to change their name? 
<BR>
 
<BR>
Just because they are heavy metal,(and for all you people who think they are "speed-metal" or "death metal" - they ARE NOT. Speed or death metal is a seperate genre to their music. They are just plain and simple heavy metal/hard rock.), doesnt mean that they are satanic or like what is going on right now because it's bringing evil upon the world. And they certainly are not doing this to get more attention and therefore make more money. 
<BR>

<BR>
This situation is out of the band's grasp. The band has been making music since the early 1980's! They shouldn't have to change it just because of anthrax the bug is starting to break out just now. 
<BR>

<BR>
They have never been demonic or satanic in there almost 20 year career. Heavy metal does not mean you are satanic or worship the devil or whatever. Thats just a very, very popular stereotype. I know they have an album out called "Spreading the Disease", but it came out YEARS ago and not just recently as quite a few of you claim. You better get your info straight before writing about it. 
<BR>

<BR>
Yeah, sure, I'm sure they'd just be so very happy to change their name to Ant-wax or whatever for the time being until this situation 'passes over'. Who knows how long that could be! If that is the case, then they should just throw in the towel right now and call it quits. Now there is a smart solution. Just quit what you have been doing almost your entire life just because your name is "offending" people because a horrible bug that coincides with your name is out.
<BR>

<BR>
THE BAND HAS NO CONTROL OVER THIS! They are not doing it on purpose! They are not trying to cause any harm. Therefore, they will NOT change their name just to make you sleep better at night! <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
to throw in my two cents, here goes.
<BR>

<BR>
1. The band Anthrax, which coincidentally were once based out of New York, are near the celebration of their 20 year anniversary.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Once you get further than Toronto, Canadian culture is LARGELY different than American. Close-bordered Canadians share common attitudes with Americans. Our continent is called North America, containing 3 countries; Canada, The United States of America, and Mexico. Together we all are North America, individually we are citizens of our respective country.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Why do we all of the sudden have to go after software creators because of their names? what happened to content control because of the moral christian bullshit?

I will admit I've seen some pretty good hoaxes in my time, and this one is one of the best. First of all, this person expects us to believe that they actually typed in the URL www.anthrax.com to find out information about anthrax? I ask you, if you wanted to find out information about malaria, would YOU type www.malaria.com? A person who actually knows what URL stands for would also know the Internet doesn't work like that. Secondly, how would a person who knows so little about heavy metal know the name Dave Mustaine? They wouldn't have found that name on Anthrax' website. Dave Mustaine is in Megadeth! And mentioning the Napster issue is almost a dead giveaway: neither Anthrax nor Dave Mustaine were ever involved in a dispute with Napster. It was virtually front page news fer Chrissake.
<BR>
Even if you just skimmed over the Anthrax website, you'd know that "Spreading the Disease" has been out since 1985.
<BR>
Whoever wrote this drivel had their tongue stuck so far in their cheek, I'm surprised they didn't choke on it. This is a very cynical and sarcastic response to all those who really do think Anthrax should change their name.

I will say this though, it certainly got a debate going.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If the author of this article really didn't want to give in to the terrorists be overreacting, then you should have done a BIT more research. By making a snap judgement and starting an email campaign with so little information...YOU are the one guilty of encouraging overreaction by doing it yourself.

This seems to be just a circle of insults based on personal viewpoints with very little relevant information being passed.  If you want to argue a point, argue it with facts, not insults.  Sure it might make you feel better but does it change anything?? I think not!  There seems to be a great deal of ignorance on both sides.  There are repeated mentions of Anthrax's "Satanic, Violence-glorifying lyrics."  But I am quite sure that very few of the people who posted these comments have even seen the lyrics.  In fact the lyrics from the band Slayer were passed off as Anthrax lyrics in one case.  If you are going to make a case, please at least know what your talking about instead of just jumping on the "let's bash Anthrax!" bandwagon.
<BR>
On the other side there are alot of religious slanders going on that I think are quite unneeded.  If you have a problem with something someone says, explain why, don't just insult them.  You will never be taken seriously without showing some class.  By doing this you are just proving their point.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the main purpose of this topic, I think only Scott and the other members can decide whether or not to change the name.  Yes it might be a nice gesture, or a publicity stunt if you want to look at it that way.  But the truth is they formed the band well before any of this was even concieved, and it is their right to keep the name if they choose to do so.  Perhaps some of their comments were distasteful, but they have been doing what they do for 20 years without anyone saying anything.  Why change that now??<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I do not think that Anthrax should change their name.  It was not an insensitive choice, as they picked their name two decades before the horrible events of Sept. 11, 2001.  Some would suggest that Anthrax would increase record sales by changing their name, but I do not agree.  The people that want them to change their name are people that don't like heavy metal, believing it to be the "devil's music", and would not buy their album whether they were called "Anthrax", "Basket Full of Puppies", or "I love Jesus".  They would, however, lose the name recognition of longtime loyal fans, and could also be accused by them of selling out their American values of freedom.

You may not change your opinion, but I would hope that you would realise that sometimes, differing viewpoints come into conflict. Conflicts which are not resolvable by conventional dialogue.
Religion is a mind trick to legitimise non-democratic power structures (be they governmental, political or whatever). Affording religions 'respect' because they claim that god told them something, out of a misplaced sense of 'valuing diversity' is the ultimate cop-out.<BR><BR>
What are you scared of ? Religious lunatics of all persuasions are running riot, furthering their agendas, and the best thing the atheists and agnostics can do is 'respect' other religions.<BR><BR>
You don't begrudge them their ridiculous views because (so far) they haven't impacted on you yet. But when they do, it will be too late for you.<BR><BR>
You might want to reflect on that for a while.

To label all religion is bad is making the same mistake as labelling all heavy metal songs as bad.  It's creating overgeneralizations that inevitably lead to prejudice.

In general, I like heavy metal music, but there are also some real assholes playing heavy metal that I don't like.  Religion has done a lot of good for a lot of people, but has also spawned extremists that have done a lot of terrible things in this world.  In my opinion, religion has caused a lot more trouble in this world than heavy metal has, so I'll listen to heavy metal and pass on the religion.  Someone else can devote their life to God and burn heavy metal albums for all I care, as long as they don't impose themselves on me.

Even then, I'm a total metalhead. I listen to heavy metal intensively because I like the musical quality and power there is to it. I have Metallica, Children Of Bodom, Slayer t-shirts and actually have Anthrax painted in liquid paper on my pencil case. I play in a small local heavy metal band and I follow many of my favorite bands' histories and I know that even though many songs talk about hell, satan, violence and all, heavy metal musicians and listeners are very intelligent people and don't worship satan at all, and are all saddened by the innocent deaths occured in the recent events. Just go in the official band websites like Anthrax's, Metallica and many others and see by yourself.

As for the drugs bullshit, it is ridiculous to relate drugs to music. It seems to many (stupid) people that as soon as you listen heavy metal (oh my god!) you take drugs and worship satan and want to kill everyone. That's bullshit. All the metalheads I know are very intelligent people, at most smoke pot once in a while and are aware that heavy metal music is about many of the best musical masterpieces of all time, not drugs, violence, satan and delinquance.

Unlike what you said, Anthrax have been going strong for since the early 80's, well before anything to do with Sept 11 2001 had arisen. The guitarist Scott Ian, came up with the name Anthrax in biology class, the guitarist also happens to be Jewish. I'm sure people with your backwards, introverted, bigot state of mind will try and make a link between those two things. and Thirdly, Anthrax are from New York, and themselves announced their deepest sympathy's for the victims of the horrendous terrorist acts.

What is aggressive hair like? Can it attack me? How do I protect myself from aggressive hair? Now I'm scared.

It's spelled "dishevelled", genius. And try to check your facts before embarking on another rabid tirade against this big, scary world that has you so clearly peeing your pants and running to Mommy Church.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as defining what America (the United States actually...America includes the areas south of here that we rather ruthlessly exploit and oppress)is about, liberty is a little highher on the totem pole than Christianity. Freedom of religion, expression and all that?
<BR>

<BR>
So, what's with all these religious patriots calling for all kinds of censorship? They are totally and irredeemably un-American.
<BR>

<BR>
And the whole gun argument: where does this statistic re: crime going up after gun control legislation being introduced originate from? I have run into it many times, but never in any form other than the traditional statement of "When legislation was introduced in England..." The source is apparently "Cos I said so"?
<BR>

<BR>
Wow. Tickle me pink. In any case, trying to argue a case with statistics is just stupid. Remeber what they say about statistics? Remember, statistics are what advertisers use.

Next, before leaping to entirely the wrong conclusion, I would hope that people who believe metal/rock must equate to songs singing the praises of death and satanism should _really_ look more closely at their targets. Anthrax do not promote violence, terrorism, death, or..(snigger) Satan. THINK, people! Art has always dealt with subject matter that is designed to promote thought.

I am 28 years old and have been a heavy metal fan since I was about 15 years old.  I have also been a fan of the band Anthrax since probably the same age.  Having said that, I have also studied Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop, Blues, R & B, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
Let's face the facts.
<BR>

<BR>
You are completely uneducated to any of the facts involving the band Anthrax, the people in the band, their lyrical content, or the entire genre of Heavy Metal for that matter.  It is completely and totally useless to argue with any of you, because none of what any of you have to say has any educated value whatsoever.
<BR>

<BR>
You are pompous, self-absorbed elitists with no concept of opinion, taste, or freedom.  The statements you have made make you all look like fools.  You are wrong about practically everything you have to say... Too many to count, in fact.  I grew tired after reading the first quarter of your poppycock, and went directly to skimming through.  You have no idea that you look like complete and total buffoons... and that is not even to your "average" Anthrax fan... not even your "average" heavy metal fan.  No, you look like complete and total buffoons to any educated person who takes ANY sort of time whatsoever to look in to FACTS and speak intelligently based upon those facts.  Your banter is disgusting, and truly a let down to our culture, our freedom, and our minds.  
<BR>

<BR>
So please... I implore you to continue with your misguided and inexcusable drivel, so anyone with half a brain can get a few laughs.
<BR>

<BR>
Do us all a favor and GET A CLUE.
<BR>

<BR>
It is people like you that will DESTROY us and our freedom as a nation under God.
<BR>

<BR>
Sincerely,
<BR>
Chris Addison

Second of all, you have no business discussing heavy metal or attempting to define it, stick to shuffling church pamphlets and giving your pastor handjobs. I'm not going to waste time explaining the difference between "Grind-Core" and speed metal, I'd have better lucky trying to elicit an orgasm from an egg.

Everything that you just proved that you are just another stereotype, an ignorant pigheaded neofascist christian whore that gives ignorant pighead fascist christian whores a bad name. Get the facts right before you spew such a blatantly laughable diatribe.
<BR>

<BR>
"Spreading the Disease" was released in NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. Hardly the new record... You criticize the band for their glaringly repentant response? Take some time out for EMPATHY, and comprehend what these people are going through... you're the kind of shithead that beats muslims in 7-11 parking lots with your drunk, obese biker "pals". 
<BR>

<BR>
My opinion is that Anthrax should stand their ground and refuse to change the name, although they probably will be harassed into it by bible thumping, starched collar uberconservative jackoffs like you.

<BR>
I doubt this will get posted since the concept of "freedom of speech" is still new to you fuckers...

oh yeah cash in on bio terrorism? how the hell can a 20 yr old band do that? its more like the pharmaceutical companies doubling the prices of antrax treatments who are trying to cash in on this "biological war" 

biological war my butt

bin laden doesnt have time for petty blue envelopes with white powder in them, heck he probably doesnt even know who tom brokaw (sp?)is...

dont start on other people's "overreactions" when you're sitting here complaining about a 20 year old band's disrespect for a disease...

you're right about the internet having everything under the sun cos i must admit, i never thought i'd see something as stupid as this -- ever

oh yes we're so innocent when we type in web addresses (most people would try msn's health site, or encartas online medical encylcopaedia... i guess that takes away the innocence that random guesses guarantee)

i have aggressively long hair which can be a pain and sometimes gets dishevelled and unkempt but maybe if i went for the bald look you'd say i had an aggressively bald head (possibly offensive to people like my father and mr clean) so i really cant win and it looks like anthrax the band can't either... hmmm have you ever seen Aaron Lewis? or the guys from Tool? they have aggressively pierced and tattooed bodies.... but none of them have aggressively long hair....

if you want to "respectfully suggest" anything, it has to involve respect and cuts like this: <i>"I am sure that being a member of the band 'Anthrax', gruelling touring schedules notwithstanding is nowhere near as painful as actually suffering from the disease itself."</i>
just display more clearly your lack of respect... its like apologising to someone and throwing in a "but i dont see why i should say sorry since u were the wrong one"

its got nothing to do with courage and heres a quick one for u i doubt the war against terrorism will ever be over there is always going to be some idiot with too much spare time and a brain full of weird ideas, but i pray that i will some day be proved wrong...

<BR>

<BR>
Joey Belladonna did rename his band...to Belladonna after he was kicked out of Anthrax in 1993.  Once again you prove your ignorance about Anthrax (the band), and use incorrect facts to base your arguments.  So why can't you simply admit that you are wrong?
<BR>

<BR>
Incidently, John Bush replaced Joey Belladonna as the lead singer of Anthrax.  Perhaps he should change his surname, since it may be confused with not one, but two US presidents, which, of course, is an insult to all Americans.

The name is simply a name that is known for their GREAT music and NOT the desease that is being spread around today. ANTHRAX the Band have/had NOTHING to do with the desease, so why in Gods' name should they change their name? They ought to keep that name. It is what they are, NOT the Infection(s). AND that album you speak of....SPREADING THE DISEASE? yes that one! That album came out in the 80's. I bought that sooooooooooo long ago. And you that has NO CLUE of WHAT the HELL you are saying OR trying to say thinks it has just come out. AND you THINK that they are trying to SELL more because of what is going on NOW? What a FUCKING DULT you are. 
<BR>
I mean come on, lets be real. You do NOT know anything you are saying.
<BR>

<BR>
ANTHRAX- the Band are Nothing that you claim them to be...NOTHING!!! They actually play GREAT Metal music. FUN Metal music. ENJOYABLY Metal music. It is NOT crap. 
<BR>

<BR>
And now there is going to be this 'burn Anthrax cds night' WHAT has ANTHRAX done to deserve any of this? I am sure they are saddened by ALL of these events as much as the rest of us.
<BR>
 AND they ARE American's and FROM NYC. So who the FUCK are you to tell them to change what is rightfully theirs.
<BR>

<BR>
Shit happens every day, and we all have to live with it and deal with it but there are so many other things to worry about out there than the name of a band.
<BR>

<BR>
The band DEATH....people die all the time, so should they change their name? NO!
<BR>

<BR>
MEGADETH----Many people died and are dying, we are at war, should they change their name? NO!
<BR>

<BR>
The CARS----People get into car accidents every day, shall they change their name? NO!
<BR>

<BR>
The Police----They"police" arrest people every day for killings and shit like this, shall they change their name? NO!
<BR>

<BR>
SO...shut the fuck up and leave the band ANTHRAX alone, they have NOTHING to do with this case or these cases. You want to do some good then leave the band alone and find the person(s) that have done the wrong by spreading this infection via mail in the first place.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
""""ANTHRAX THE BAND ARE GREAT THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE  IS A TRAGEDY. BUT THE BAND ARE NOT SELLING RECORDS DUE TO THIS...."""
<BR>

<BR>
SO DICKWEED, get your stories and facts correct before judging something or someone that you know positively NOTHING about.

Firstly, Anthrax have been around for almost 20 years and the "Spreading the Disease" record came out in 1985!!! Secondly, Dave Mustaine, quoted in the article, is actually the lead singer for Megadeth--he has nothing to do with Anthrax at all! What makes you think that a band would consider changing their name of 20 years to something as ridiculous as Ant Wax? I sincerely hope the poll with alternative name suggestions were a joke. Thirdly, Puff Daddy certainly does continue to use that name, along with the P-Diddy and Sean "Puffy" Combs variations, depending on the project he's working on. Give the guys a break--it's idiots like you that are causing the hyper-sensitivity surrounding this tragedy. That's right, although you may think of me as supporting this "satanic depravity", I agree that this is a terrible thing to have happened, but I also believe we should be thinking about finding the ones responsible, rather than harassing some poor band into changing their name "for the duration of the war".

Anthrax the band has nothing to do with Anthrax the disease.

And by the way, they are NOT a new band, they do NOT have a new cd out called Spreading the Disease. The band ANTHRAX have been a band with the name ANTHRAX since 1980 or so, and the Spreading the Disease record came out in like 1985.

I am appalled at your completely unfair and totally uneducated attempt at getting Anthrax to change their name.  The main reason for my disdain is because of your COMPLETE and INEXCUSEABLE lack of research on the issue.  The saddest part of your assault on them was that all the information you needed to avoid this waste of cyberspace was right in front of your eyes in the quotation you pulled directly from the website.  
<BR>

<BR>
I don't know who any of you are and I won't judge you as naive or culturally inept with your lack of knowledge of the band Anthrax heretofore.  I do not expect you to be able to name their songs or bandmembers verbatim the way I can, and I understand that because of it you are at a distinct disadvantage.  However I do feel it my job to inform you of your gross inaccuracies about the band unfairly portrayed in this waste of cyberspace you refer to as a "petition".  
<BR>

<BR>
These are the TRUTHS about the band ANTHRAX, whom I have been listening to since their inception.  
<BR>
**Note: Please understand that in no way is my opinion biased because of my enjoying their music--I would have gladly defended, say, Wayne Newton if you had lambasted him so attrociously.  
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX is NOT a "grind core" band.  They play 
<BR>
 heavy thrash-metal.  By pigeonholing them as a   different genre of music than they actually play, 
<BR>
you set the stage for the further fallacies to come.  
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX is NOT a "devil-worshipping" band.
<BR>

<BR>
-ANTHRAX grew up in New York, still live there, 
<BR>
 and know a hell of a lot more about the true 
<BR>
 brevity of the events on September 11th than you
<BR>
 may think!
<BR>
 
<BR>
-ANTHRAX is not a band of carefree rockstars who 
<BR>
 pose about in lavish luxury as you portray--rather quite the  contrary.  I have met guitarist Scott Ian in  person in Connecticut a few years ago, and can   attest he is a gentleman in spite
<BR>
 of his rock-star status you claim as a shortcoming. The band has performed with Afro-American musicians outside of their genre in an effort to promote racial harmony within the ranks of rock music.  The band has also 
<BR>
 performed charity concerts for the homeless, 
<BR>
 their cause-celebre, on a regular basis--even 
<BR>
 performing a song about the homeless in and 
<BR>
 around their New York on their "State of 
<BR>
 Euphoria" album called "Who Cares Wins".  You may
<BR>
 also find it interesting to note that the band does not drink or do drugs of any kind, and promotes a drug-free lifestyle.
<BR>

<BR>
-And above all, and most the most blatant         misrepresentation in your calvacade of faux-pas is the fact that ANTHRAX, the band you erroneously refer to as a "new" band, has actually been around since the days of New Coke, DeLoreans and Reaganomics.  Infact, the so called "new" album you referred to as the most offensive, "Spreading The Disease", was actually in existence since--gasp!!--1985!!
<BR>

<BR>
I will tell you to save your breath, because your pleas will fall on deaf ears.  The band has decided to stick to their name.  And why shouldn't they??  Hasn't any of the last few weeks taught you anything about the scare-tactics??  The ritualistic name-changing of a band will do little to curb the already minute threat of Anthrax (the disease) in our country.  All it will do is feed the Taliban press or whatever sick faction is responsible for this, with further ammunition to appease their die-hard ranks, and help them believe that they are winning the war against America.  President Bush insisted Americans continue on living our lives as before, and I would liken this suggestion on your part to the recent decline in travel due to people avoiding airplanes--once again, positive feedback for the enemy's front.  What's more, as I've clearly shown above and any researcher truly worth their salt can plainly see, the band ANTHRAX has predated the current scare that bears the same name by two decades.  And your lame-ass attempts to re-name the band (Aunt-Wax??  COME ON!!) are about as mealy-mouthed as the information you posted on this site.
<BR>

<BR>
I say again--as a soldier defending your country, I am ashamed at this aberration of the First Amendment.  Your attempt to undermine this band, spearheading them as an accomplice in the insidious events of the past few weeks, let alone the past month is nothing more than a smear campaign--the equivalent of picking flyshit out of pepper.  
<BR>

<BR>
I am cc'ing this letter to the ANTHRAX fan email to let them know about this ridiculous petition, and am urging everybody to disregard this ludicrous petition as rubbish.  The fact remains that ANTHRAX the band had nothing to do with the recent outbreaks.  Their name is nothing more than an ironic coincidence.  And to the author of this shameless smear campaign, I urge you to research your facts thoroughly before you post any information on the internet or any other medium under the guise of a well-learned source.

Umm, like most media, the author of this story did not check even the most obvious of facts. the heavy metal band "Anthrax" has been around for 20+ years. Their so called "new" album, "Spreading the Disease" came out in 1985. How do I know this? I bought that album when I was in Jr High School (I'm 31 now) on vinyl, before CD was in mass production. I bought it at a music store chain called "Big Ben's" which is now better known as Tower Records. Now if that's new, then I would like to find out where the author's time machine is because I would love to put some money into Microsoft stock knowing how it's going to do in the few years after 1985. Instead of pleading with the band to change their name of 20+ years based on misinformation or just a plain old LIE, how about plead with your editors to check their facts before posting articles that are nothing better than pure fantasy and fiction. Can you imagine what a publisher like the New York Times or the Washington Post would have to pay in libel for printing something like this? I just hope the band doesn't take that kind of action against you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Have you read any of these 305 posts, or just your own?  At least two dozen different people, if not more, mentioned the untruths in dmg's original post, and a quick look at the bands website would have shown the info to be false.

  How ignorant can you get?  Anthrax has been a band for over 20 years and are a well respected and firmly established proffesional musical act.  Your ignorance on this subject is overwhelming!  Who ever wrote this article did minimal research on the group, which is evident by all the assinine remarks that are made throughout the article.  Anthrax the band is not "Grid-core" or "Death Metal" by any stretch of the imagination.  Nor are they "cashing in" on the unfortunate situation which has unfolded in the past few weeks. Here is a quote from your article  "I didn't want to overreact (since that is what the terrorists want us to do)."  Well, this is exactly what you have done!  By slamming the band Anthrax for an unfortunate coincidence you are acting according to the wishes of terrorism and are in effect spreading intolerance, fear, hatred, and ignorance.  Incidentaly, had you ever listened to the album "Spreading the Disease", you would have become aware that there is not one single song on that album that has anything to do with the spread of bio-terrorism.  You need to calm down, grown up, get real, and get a life!  Long live Anthrax (the band), and let's hope anthrax the disease becomes a thing of the past very quickly.  Nuff said.

I started reading some of it and just laughed at the errors and wrongful thoughts and interperations of people that posted here. Why in the hell a band should change their name due to recent events. Or for that matter, when there are so many people in need why waste time and money on a stupid website concerned with a band that you know nothing about. I could take the easy road and claim that political correctness and fear of insulting people got us into a situation where people who viemently HATED us lived among us freely and had their rights protected up until the point they decided to kill 6000 of us. But I wont. All I will say is Anthrax should keep their name, people should visit NYC and people should fly on airplanes at will. We should keep and protect everything that is normal to us and never tiptoe around or change our beliefs or ideas on what is now OK because of what some terrorists have done to us.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anthrax, have been around since the early 1980s and are in no way trying to make a buck off of the current unfortunate trends of bio-terrorism.  Check out the rock show on VH1 on Fridays at midnight...it's hosted by their rhythm guitarist...let him explain it to you.  He is as upset as anyone by whats happening and finds it difficult to be in a band that has the name of what is now a serious biological threat, that none of us really thought we would see done in our lifetimes.  
<BR>

<BR>
So you want this band to change their name...WHY??!!  They have every right to have their name, and if they change it, strike up a victory for whoever is causing this scare!  Because that's what it would be...changing the name of this band would be an act of FEAR, and an act against America and the freedoms it was founded on.  Adequacy.org...news for grown ups, hardly...rather more like news for people afraid of freedom, and afraid to live their lives in the face of what may scare them...in another word, Cowards!!!   In the words of Thomas Jefferson, "Those who would trade freedom for security deserve neither."  I for one say the same for all of you.

First, death-metal bands are more brutal than thier music. But I admit, this tag is easier for you to scare people.
<BR>
Joey Belladonna left the band a long time ago.
<BR>
When you see some recent pictures of the band, can you tell me who's got long hair ???
<BR>
This band has always been one of the smartest, dealing with lyrics. For instance in "Among the Livind" or "State of Euphoria" LPs, some lyrics are inspired by Stephen King's novels. So, we know they are able to READ ! Most of average metal bands only talk about death, murders or satan.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway...
<BR>
Do yo want to put a ban on Guns'n'Roses too ? And what about the Rolling Stones ? Seen from now, this name may be seen as an encouragement for "intifada" for Palestinian people. Who draws the line ? Is Slipknot OK to you ?
<BR>

<BR>
Don't you have anything more important to do than trying to raise censorship ? Are you aware the taliban's regime is using censorship too ?

First off, I'd to thank the band Anthrax for not using their talent and power to write music about how uninformed and unintelligent we are.  I'm glad that NOBODY has noticed our lack of research on this issue.  Thankfully they do not have a fan-base that could do some harm to our mindless ranting.  Please, tell your friends about the above article so the entire world can see how retarded we really are.

It might be cashing in if they had changed there name to anthrax after the 9-11 incident.  This is not the case.  In the early eighties (20 years before the 9-11 incident) they named themselves anthrax.  Besides this president bush has stated that we should go back to living as things were before the incident or we are giving in to terrorism.  Well anthrax was anthrax before and the will be after the incident.  You also forget to mention that they have came out in support of the firefighters and police officers that died that day.  They were part of a fundraiser concert.  Besides this anthrax is not that popular anymore, a would bet that 99% of the people who would be offended by the name no nothing about the band or even that it exists, except for this dumb website that think it should change its name.  Well i hope you know that all you'll do is sell some more records for them.  Thats my piece.   <BR><BR></FONT></td>

First of all, Anthrax the band has been around since the early 80's, and named the band just because it sounded like a cool metal name.  The guys in the band are very down to earth and have done alot to help out in these times of tragedy.  Also, they are very talented musicians, and if you do gooders out there don't like it, TURN IT OFF!!  There are too many other things out there for you to worry about than a rock bands' name!!  You people always have to preach about something!!  Get off your goddamned high horses and realize that this is AMERICA!!  Trying to get someone to change a name or change their musical tastes is no better than communism!  If you want to live in a society that regulates everything you do, then GET THE HELL OUT OF MY COUNTRY!!  I, for one am proud to be an American, and very pleased that I can Listen to what I want, watch what I want, and go where I want.  You people say that you're Christians?  If so, then start acting like one damnit!!  Anthrax is a very talented group of individuals and I suggest you do your research before making comments about anything.  Find out just what kind of people they are!  I personally have met Scott Ian, the guitarist, and let me tell you, he is a very nice guy and happy that he is American.  Just keep in mind that they are not a new band, these guys have been at it longer than you think, and they are damned good at what they do!  Open your minds assholes!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Don't you people have anything better to do than to attempt to incite near-hysteria over a f**king band's name?

Did you know there was an industrial band called Einsturzende Neubauten that came out about 20 or so years ago... and their name means "Collapsing New Buildings" in German. Of course you didn't, because that would have taken a bit of honest research and fact checking, neither of which applies to you. Perhaps now you can organize a burning of EN discs since they obviously have disrespected the memory of the people who perished in the WTC and the Pentagon.... pfffft. While you're at it make sure and pass around the collection plate, since people tend to be more generous when they are upset or feel threatened... it's worked for the Church for centuries, so why stop now, right?

This nation was founded on the principles of liberty, equality and justice, all of which were ratified by people who were disgusted with the religious zealotry that permeated the United Kingdom in the 17th Century. Unfortunately, it seems that ignorant ranting under the guise of "true Christian values" continues unabated, and your narrow-mindedness sickens me just as much as does the Taliban's. Get off of your soapbox, do some fact-checking and honest research before you open your mouth and spew idiotic rhetoric. 
<BR>

<BR>
For the record: I am a metal fan in my early 30's, have 2 degrees and I am finishing my Master's Degree in sociology this coming Spring. I have extremely long hair, yet also hold a very good position within a Fortune 500 company that is run by people who learned a long time ago never to judge a book by its' cover. I renounced my Christian faith years ago after I realized that I was following a hollow faith created by man, not God.
<BR>

<BR>
I am also a Satanist, which may frighten the general Christian hordes, but if you actually did your homework you'd realize that most Satanists do not worship an invisible entity unlike Christians, but rather we acknowledge that there is just as much good as there is evil in the world. We don't sacrifice babies, or any of the drivel that Hollywood has managed to brainwash the masses with. We do, however, hold in contempt stupidity and ignorance as a cardinal sin... and from what I've gathered several people that have posted here regarding Anthrax are lucky to be walking upright. The thought of people as narrow-minded, bigoted and ignorant such as "dmg" procreating sends shivers down my spine. 
<BR>

<BR>
Get off of your soapbox and pay attention to the real issues, and do us all a favor and shut your trap if you don't know what you're talking about.

Oh, and change the name of the site to Inadequacy.org, since that's more fitting. "News for grown ups" - perhaps for those grown ups whose idea of literary enlightenment is reading the National Enquirer while watching Jerry Springer.

1) Anthrax has had this name for 20 years.
<BR>

<BR>
2) Anthrax has gone to the press on numerous occasions to make clear that they in no way want to profit from their name.
<BR>

<BR>
3) Anthrax has done in deed what they've said in word, for example by refusing to allow Bayer to place banner ads for Cipro on their web site.
<BR>

<BR>
4) Dave Mustaine is the lead singer of Megadeth
<BR>

<BR>
5) It's Metallica that complained about their music being downloaded off of Napster (and rightfully so).
<BR>

<BR>
6) Spreading the Disease was released in the 1980's, well before the problems that we now face were imaginable.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't have to insult this cause separately.  Posting facts next to your little attempt at supporting an argument does it for me.
<BR>

<BR>
In normal times, it's shameful and ridiculous that people try to censor literature, music, or art in accordance with their own tastes, as opposed to worrying about real problems.  In these times it's even worse.  This web site's authors, supporters, and those who sign this petition are no better than the Jerry Falwells who waste our time blaming the world's ills on straw men.

Well they already broke up so I guess we saved our children from those "evil doers."

If you looked up anything on the band Anthrax, you would see that they formed in 1981, a whole 20 years before this whole event started happening. Whining over a name is such a trivial matter, if you want to do something, go help the homeless or the people who need help.They are evn playing a benefit show for the victims of the New York tragedy. Go to the website, read the bands comments, just don't assume something. You know what they say about assume- it makes an ass out of you and me. And to quote the words of the band-
<BR>
"Now in the wake of those events, our name symbolizes fear, paranoia and death. Suddenly our name is not so cool. To be associated with these things we are against is a strange and stressful situation. To us, and to millions of people, it is just a name. We don't want to change the name of the band, not because it would be a pain in the ass, but because we hope that no further negative events will happen and it won't be necessary. We hope and pray that this problem goes away quietly and we all grow old and fat together."-Anthrax

To put this in perspective, should, lessee, Jefferson Airplane change their name?  Wait, I think they're all dead.  How about people with beards?  Others might think they're terrorists.

Also, how does Dave Mustaine fit into this? ("On the one hand, Dave Mustaine complains that people are stealing the band's music via Napster, and yet at the same time, he feels free to insult the record buying public with his irredeemable horrifically tasteless posturing, at a time when the whole country is feeling weak and vulnerable.")

Why be offended by a band name that can cause NO harm whatsoever, well except to bring uninformed idiots out of the woodwork, who pride themselves in speaking on psuedo-platforms because they can't do anything to change what's really going on in the country right now.

The poster of this trash is highly uninformed, but the people who read it and are of the same opinions are even worse. They HAVE been informed, yet still fail to see it. That makes you dense.

As for increased record sales, indeed that may happen because of the likes of people seen here who bring people's uninformed attention to it. Anthrax, the band, has only made a press release in response to people like you. You brought this issue to the surface, not the band. So if your innocent children have their curiosity teased, and want to hear this music that you so ignorantly oppose, blame yourselves.

If you didn't notice, they ARE indeed being sympathetic, and are now regretting having their name.  They also mention their first album from the EARLY EIGHTIES, which basically belies your entire argument.  They've been around for 20 years, like everyone has said, and they could not have forseen this anthrax scare at the time.  
<BR>

<BR>
I mean, really... are you expecting them to be prophets or something?
<BR>

<BR>
You also mentioned that their ways are "satanist" and the like.  Well, to my knowledge... obviously not to yours, Scott Ian, the main publicized member of the band, is a devout member of the Jewish faith.
<BR>

<BR>
Spreading the Disease came out in 1985.  See previous response.
<BR>

<BR>
For the record, Dave Mustaine is in Megadeth, NOT Anthrax.  So why even mention him in the argument?  Exactly.  There's no reason to.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
And another thing, all the lyrics aren't about death... so the line "You're anti, you're anti-social!" has to do with the current American crisis?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
So, I'd like to tell anyone who is about to email the band (which, it seems, is very few except for the album burning type...) DON'T.  This person doesn't have their facts straight.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Now, regarding the album burning types.  You obviously need to get your facts straight too.  It's like saying, "Hey, you didn't predict a disaster 20 years ago that makes your name bad... so we're burning all of your 15-20 year old albums!  MUAHAHAHAHAhahahahaha..."  Now, let's say... just hypothetically... that some random Christian author wrote a book 20 years ago, and the current situation makes it offensive to some people... would you like them BURNING ALL OF THE BOOKS?  Or howabout, since he's a Christian author, hypothetically...  just BURN THE BIBLE?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I can only hope that if anthrax (the DISEASE) spreads across the country, it takes out dumb, pretentious assholes like you.  This would make our country better as a whole.  You're like the people who don't believe in evolution... I can see why, it looks like you have the intelligence of a large ape.

1st.. Anthrax, the band, is not a "new" band... they have been around for 20 years, there name was chosen WELL before any of these terrible events in our country began.  I am only 21, and even I know that!
<BR>

<BR>
2nd.. The Anthrax album "Spreading the Disease" came out in the 80s... that is not considered a new release... where the heck have you been?

3rd.. Dave Mustaine is in the band MEGADEATH (which is also not new, so is not trying to be funny) and has nothing to do with Anthrax, ya genius.
<BR>

<BR>
4th.. Dave Mustaine, also was not the one fighting Napster... that was Lars Ulrich, he is from the band Metallica... ever heard of them?  Or are they a "new" band too?
<BR>

<BR>
5th.. The fact that the term "Puff" has reference to drug use has NOTHING to do with why P. Diddy changed his name.
<BR>

<BR>
I see you must know how the internet works, it would be worth your while to find a search engine and do a little research before you make an ASS of yourself!  Oh... oops... it's a little too late for that one now isn't it?!?!?!?!
<BR>

<BR>
I would think that since you found the site www.anthrax.com, and saw that it was a band, you would have maybe looked into it a little, before making a bunch of CRAP up about them!  Good Job ya idiot!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Get a clue.

BTW, Spreading the Disease was released in 1985.  Let me guess, they predicted Sept 11th events 16 years ago, right? :o Their newest album, released in 1998, is called The Threat is Real.  Do a little research before you start making accusations!! :p

Did any of you Politically correct numba$$es petition for the Dead Kennedies to change their name?  I mean, "how does America feel having our revered assassinated president to be humorized by a punk band?"

I could understand if the band just came out SINCE the terrorist attack, however this is ludicrous!!

If you cannot deal with our new society and this age of terrorism, then go hide in your momma's skirts.  If you feel particularly "wounded", talk to a head-doctor or call someone who cares!!  But don't expect society to change because of "things being related to Sept 11th".

Now onto the many other mistakes made. They are not a grindcore band, nor death metal. their cds(excluding the latest 2, stomp 442 and volume 8:the threat is real) are thrash/speed metal. Dave Mustaine is not in Anthrax, has never been in Anthrax and will never be. Freedom of speech is something everyone is supposed to have and this is trying to be taken away from the band. They are not preaching bio-terrorism or war in any fashion. I think instead of looking for a scapegoat to blame something on, let things be and concentrate on more pressing issues like anthrax, the disease, and what is being done about it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I am sure you are aware of the criticism rap has gotten over the years because of violent lyrics from artists such as Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and many others. Well, there is also a rapper by the name of DMG that belongs to the group Facemob. He, along with his group, promotes the same senseless killing, drug use, and derogatory comments towards women just like every other rapper out there. 
<BR>

<BR>
I find your user name to be offensive during these controversial times.
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps you can call yourself "abc" or something of that nature that would preserve the continuity of your image, without causing such enormous offense to the more vulnerable members of this site.
<BR>

<BR>
It would be a great way for you to do your bit to help us heal the wounds that rappers such as Eminem have opened.
<BR>

<BR>
Just in case you don't believe me, here is an excerpt of his lyrics from a song entitled "RAL Mafia." Enjoy:
<BR>

<BR>
Niggas sure wonder why I hang with these thugs
<BR>
Cause my Nigga Yuk fuckin' these Niggas up
<BR>
Nigga, this Rap-A-Lot Mafia till I die
<BR>
Why? Because we ride
<BR>
Everyday do or die
<BR>
Riffles and .45's
<BR>
17-shot nines
<BR>
Right up between your eyes
<BR>
Niggas is gonna die
<BR>
Niggas come from the pound
<BR>
Hummers and S-S's
<BR>
Born to be a killer
<BR>
Fill a Nigga
<BR>
Body with holes
<BR>
Head to toe when he showed up
<BR>
Blow up your whole motherfuckin' head, quote us
<BR>
And I'ma roll, with my Niggas till the wheels fall
<BR>
Clean up the motherfuckin' car
<BR>
And in this room we bring the world war
<BR>

<BR>
Need I go on. Thank you for reading this and I am sure you will do the right thing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you are serious about this page, I'm sorry, but you have no case, you're just plain flat out wrong.

<BR>
1. most of you dumb FUCKRAGS writing on this board who have complained about anthrax's lyrics seem to somehow confuse their lyrics with hmmmmm SLAYER and METALLICA and MEGADETH so you can support your pathetically stupid points with equally and pathetically bad evidence that isnt fucking right. for example one of you fucking dickmunching wankers seems to have presumed that the METALLICA classic 'ride the lightning' encourages children to fly kites in the lightning. WHAT THE FLYING FUCK!???? get your fukcing facts straight asshole
<BR>
2. yes, the knowlegeable people are right anthrax was formed in fducking 1980 before the concept of BIOTERRORISM was even concieved you dumbasses!"!!!!! 
<BR>
3. occasionaly anthraxs lyrics may seem a little pro violence but its all about expressing that anger into something positive you fucking idiots !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! people go home and listen to heavy metal because it STOPS them fucking killing people!! metral deals to the darker emotions, in much the way that EA Poe dealt with the darker side of life in his writings. without this freedom to express what anthrax have to say, how the fuck can you express it?????????? you cant go out and say that shit in public now can you? if there even is one song on any of there 13 fucking cds about bioterrorism then it doesnt fukcing focus on promoting that bullshit its all about channeling the anger on the subject into a positive means so they can express it in a way that a listener can connect to it you FUCKRAGS! fuck

Shame on all you Bible-thumping Christian supremacists.  You have outdone yourselves in terms of tastelessness yet again.  I urge you to cease your exploitation of tragic events and manipulation of young minds.  Let the kids think for themselves.  You might be suprised at how smart they are.  Mint, I'll see you in hell.

It is simply who they are, and what they want their name to be. to tell them to change their name is taking away from their identity.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is a shame that you are so vengeful towards the band Anthrax when you are so misinformed. Anthrax has been around for almost 20 years, and I have been a fan of the band for many years. They are by no means a "new" band. They are also by no means a "death metal" or "grindcore" band. They have taken no measures to profit in any way from the attack of 9/11. Anthrax is from New York! 
<BR>
Given that you have so little understanding about metal music, it is ludicrous for you to make any suggestions as to how the band should deal with what could be considered a public relations disaster. It is certainly true that people may find the band name offensive given current circumstances, but for them to change their moniker after 2 decades seems drastic. By your mentality the Grateful Dead should have changed their name during any trying period or loss of life, as they showed no respect for the dead who would certainly be more grateful to be alive!!! 
<BR>
While I certainly agree that musicians should be sensitive to this matter, what you ask goes far beyond reason. The rap group The Coup had an album cover of the Twin Towers exploding, which went to press before the attack. The cover was pulled immediately, as to not trample the sensitive American psyche. This is reasonable. It was directly related, new and easy to change. Dream Theater enacted similar measures with their cover of Scenes from New York. Both of these products were new, easy to change, and of minimal consquence to change. Anthrax is not in the same position. If they were planning on releasing an album called "Mail Order Terrorism," before the attacks, no one would question the need for them to change their product. But to, not only insist that they change their name, but beligerently attack them while knowing so little about the group, just shows a hyper-reactionary way of thought that is highly counterproductive during these times, and is further conducive to panic!! The link you have to the site for "Spreading the Disease" shows the release date as 1986! If you followed your own link, you would have to rethink your entire article! 
<BR>
I sincerely hope that you reconsider your stance on this matter, not only for yourself, but for the benefit of those that may be swayed by your misinformation. Now is not the time for us to be picking fights within, we need to put our differences aside and prepare for hard times ahead. Do not let such petty differences in opinion undermine the devastating seriousness of our country's current environment.

Not to mention the several death threats I have received from so-called intelligent 'metalheads'. You see, metalheads are by nature quite violent, and have trouble distinguishing fantasy from reality.<BR><BR>
Fantasy - everyone in the world should recognise 'metal' as a great artform.<BR><BR>
Reality - Metal is a shitty excuse for music that should be banned as it is without artistic merit, and basically encourages crime, satanism and violence. Metalheads are some of the most bigoted vain obsessive idiots in the world.<BR><BR>
Perhaps if you stopped spending so much time admiring your curly long hair in the mirror and trying to look like Eddie Van Halen or that guy out of Poison and instead took time out to listen to some real music (rap and hip hop for example) you would not feel the need to make so many death threats.<BR><br><i>time to give a Newtonian demonstration - of a bullet, its mass and its acceleration.</i><br>

Are you REALLY going to have the testicular fortitude to say that something should be banned because it has no merrit? If so, you oughtta just take this site down now.
<BR>

<BR>
First, you're ignorant enough to try and mislead people with false information, then you also state your opinion as fact, then when people who knew all the facts called you on it, you just came up with the oh-so-clever "all metalheads are violent" crap. Then again what choice did you have? Even you know that your false representation can't be defended so where else could you go with your argument?
<BR>

<BR>
You want to talk fantasy from reality? You actually believe the things you are saying are true and of journalistic quality. You, in fact, are quite delusional.
<BR>

<BR>
I mean, you did mention rap and hip hop as if they were credible sources for peace and love. So either you're delusional or you just put this "article" up to get a rise out of us metalheads and to get a lot of visitors to this stupid site.
<BR>

<BR>
SO, who exactly is trying to profit from the recent anthrax scare? A band that's been around for 20 years? Or a moron who wants to make his fame by making a band look like they're guilty of what he, himself is? An oportunist who can't make a name for himself without using someone elses platform.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I really wish people would find out facts and do their homework before they try and attack a band that has been around for years. Yes, the band in question is Anthrax. Yes, their name <b>IS</b> Anthrax.<BR><BR> 

What the one who calls himself "DMG" should know is that the band Anthrax is <b>NOT</b> a new band. In fact, the band has been around since 1982. They are not "Grind-Core" (which is spelled Grindcore without a hyphen), and if you would have even bothered to listen to or read the lyrics to any Anthrax CD you will see that they talk about nothing Satanic related at all. One more time, had some bothered to investigate the band further they would have known that Joey Belladonna has not been apart of Anthrax since 1991.<BR><BR> 

"Spreading The Disease" a new CD? Can we please do some homework here people!? The CD in question actually came out in 1985, 16 years before the recent anthrax scare. Any plain Joe who would simply pick the CD up and look at copyright date on the back side on the bottom of CD would clearly see that.  Again, if you bothered to listen or even read the lyrics to the CD you would see that the lyrics have nothing to do with Bioterrorism whatsoever. <BR><BR> 

Wait, now Anthrax are "Death Metal?" I thought they were "Grindcore?" I think DMG has a distate for the genre of Heavy Metal and it's subgenres and is trying to stir up controversy with it relating to recent events. Let's stick to the subject at hand here.<BR><BR> 

As far as Anthrax being juvenile goes, well yes, they are juvenile and actually have a sense of humor (which is something many people in this country lack). Goof-balls are who Anthrax are, it's who they've always been in their nearly 20 years of existence, and it's who I hope they continue to be. <BR><BR> 

As I suspected, I think you dislike the music form of Heavy Metal and simply need an outlet to base soiceties problems on. I don't see what ranting about Dave Mustaine has to do with anything relating to Anthrax (the band or otherwise). If you thought Dave Mustaine is apart of the band Anthrax then I truly feel sorry for you because he is not and never was. He is a close friend of the band but has never been apart of the band.<BR><BR> 

Please, do not try to place societies problems on one band who happened to have a name which people fear right now. Before the anthrax scare broke, no one mentioned one word about the band, but now that everyone is scared of what is going on in this country they feel the need to attack the band. I don't agree that Anthrax should have to change their name. In fact, I applaude them for keeping their name. They are the only ones out of this whole disaster to show some strength and go on strong, and keep their name flying high, no matter how much of a negative reaction they get from people. It's the true metal way.<BR><BR> 

Ever since the terrorist attacks of September 11, everyone has been postponing prior obligations and changing things simply because of what has happened. That is not the American way in my humble opinion. We are not about backing down. America is about going on, going strong, and not letting anything get in our way. I understand that what happened on Sep. 11 was very tragic and will never be forgotten, but we've got to move on and move on strong! We've mourned enough and now it's time to strive forward. We've got to show the world that we won't let anything slow us down, not this terriorist attack, not this scare of anthrax, not anything.<BR><BR> 

Do not try and put words into the mouth of the band. The band never stated the death of those who were infected by anthrax was a joke to them. The band feels just as terrible as the rest of America, but they refuse to let recent events hinder their name. Their name has nothing to do with the disease and never has.<BR><BR> 

And for future references, next time can we please get the facts right before we open our mouths people? The world would be a much better place if people could grasp a concept such as that.<BR><BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I've been reading to the Netherlander report about the case brought forth from the name of the metal band Anthrax and the omonimous disease which is spreading terror all over the world: I've been simply disgusted from the words written on it. It's incredible how people can speak without having an idea about what they're talking about and without being acquainted. First off: Anthrax plays THRASH METAL, not grind-core or speed metal. They are different sub-genres of heavy metal music. Second thing, Anthrax band exists since 1981, they are not a "new rock band" as written on that misunderstanding report. Their first album "Fistful of Metal" was released in 1983. "Spreading the Disease", the album which created so many controversies, was released in 1984, it's their second work, not their new LP and, above all, songs in it DON'T TALK ABOUT BIOTERRORISM, but simply tell about personal points of view of day-by-day life. Spreading the disease is a metaphor for spreading the heavy metal music all over the world. 
<BR>
This is the truth, so there is no reason for the band to change their name, which is a symbol of heavy metal history in years... The band has no involvment with all the horror and violence exploded in these days. The next time you will criticize something or someone, please go straight to acquaint before insulting the great world of heavy metal. We're fed up with being pointed as Satan worshipers, such as violent death's predicators, as non-decorous people. We're just music listeners and/or players: heavy metal was not born to engage in politics, it is and always will an entertainment for whoever loves hard sound and great musicianship. Heavy metal is the right answer to "right-thinking people" who thinks to clean thier conscience by demonizing against the easy-accused of a difficult situation.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
