      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I am looking at the context of behaviour as how a person chooses to act.
<p>
At any moment there are many possible actions available to us. But which action shall we pick? We have to make a decision and from these decisions our behaviour is developed.<dt>
A large influence on our decision process is the environment surrounding us. We are constantly monitoring what we see, hear, smell and feel. From this we generate a perception of our current situation. We then use this perception of ourself and environment to generate goals. We arent random creatures - we constantly have specific needs and desires no matter how trivial. These are our goals - even if they are subconcious. We will pick actions that lead us to satisfy these goals that we have set. 
<p>
In order to make the best decision, we predict the outcome of possible actions in order to decide the one which helps further our goals. In order to do this more effectively we make good use of another factor involved in the decision process - our past experience; the memories stored in our brain.
<p>
Understand that im not saying that this decision process happens foremost, but that it is happening on a subconcious level all the time. There is no need for us to do much thinking about simple decisions and accordingly, these are done subconciously. For example you walk out of your house to go shopping. I bet you dont even think which direction to walk in - its a subconcious decision that you dont need to think about.
<p>
Therefore how we act isnt down to any form of magic - its just a very complex logical process.
I belive that human behaviour can be explained as a cause-action model; that every person's actions could theoretically be predicted in advance from any situation.
<p>
Many people will site the fact that we cant actually do this as a reason for this being incorrect.
<dt>
An easy counter-argument is to use the weather system as an example. The weather system is also unpredictable but we know for sure that its a cause-action model - that theoretically we could predict the weather 100% if only we had all the information.<dt>
But of course the weather system is just too complex for us to model accurately - we can never hope to be able to know the exact position of every water droplet in the atmosphere at any given time and according to chaos theory this is what we would have to do in order for our predictions to be accurate.
<p>
So you see, the fact that we cant possibly predict something doesnt mean it isnt predictable and its workings ilogical. The human brain is even more complex than the global weather system so its no wonder that we havent been able to predict human behaviour. But this alone doesnt mean the workings of the brain are any form of magic. On the contrary, the fact that the brain is there and that we know there are complex electrical networks inside it, that people with damaged brains display damaged thought processes - these all provide evidence - even though not conclusive at all - that the brain is of a logical, physical design. 
<p>
Another main argument against human behaviour being logical or explainable is to site that emotions are a magical force that science cannot explain. A common assertion is that love is the most complex emotion and cannot be explained as logic - in fact love is a very simple emotion. Emotions such as love and hate are simple, low level emotions. 
<p>
We could assume that most species on earth feel some form of love emotion which acts as instinctive force which leads animals to seek out mates. We cant turn love off or help it so it must be instinctive. It probable that most animal species only feel lust - the instinct to mate. But in some species (such as ours) love exists - many male mammals feel a form of love which binds them to protecting their mate just as humans do. Female mammals feel a form of love which binds them to protecting their offspring. So it could be argued that love is a simple, logical mechanism that aids survival. That the human species has taken love further to mean something more - such as marriage and "rules of engagement", is simply down to the beliefs enforced by our society.<dt>
Hate is an emotion of defense. By hating something that threatens you in some way, your body can over-ride the fear of confronting that threat - to be able to stand your ground or force your way. This also is very useful in survival. Its hard to imagine that when two rival males of a species are fighting each other over territory or a mate, that they are feeling anything other than hate for each other.
<dt>
Now, humans are obviously more intelligent than other species and we have developed the love emotion further - its a critical emotion for us as we are social creatures. But it is difficult to see why fundamentally our emotion of love is really much different than the emotion of love that dolphins or apes feel for example.
<p>
I said that love and hate are basic emotions - examples of more complex emotions are embarassment and guilt. I doubt many other species on earth will feel these emotion apart from humans. Embarassment is a social emotion which makes you feel bad if you do something out of place of the community. <dt>
Maybe this is a safeguard against us doing stupid things that would get us kicked out of a community. Its sure harder to explain embarassment logically than it is to explain love or hate.
<p>
So I conclude that human emotion and behaviour is in no way a unique ability and that many other animals share our most valued emotions. That just because these emotions seem strong to us that doesnt make them ilogical. That human behaviour is logical but too complex for us to ever be able to predict. A good thing I think.

<i>We could assume that most species on earth feel some form of love emotion which acts as instinctive force which leads animals to seek out mates.</i><BR><BR>
I will grant you that we could assume that, we could assume anything if we wanted. In light of the evidence of why animals choose the mates they do I don't think you can use that assumption to make any sort of viable argument. There are literally reams of documentation as to why animals choose particular mates, and it varies by species or even locality. I know of no text that claims that the process invloves love in any way, nor does it involve any emotion at all. We humans are very similar, except that we are 'thinking animals'. For certain, we go through an arduous process when we select a mate but the <b>reasons</b> why are totally different. Lower animals care only about propagating their genetic material and thus choose mates that appear most likely to ensure that happens. When a quail puffs himself up and stuts around a wheat field, he is merely displaying his ability to provide food for his offspring in the manner that thousands of years of evolution have accorded to his species. He is not attempting to get a female bird to fall in love with him. The females will select a mate by listening to their drumming and watching their little dances. What this has to do with providing for offspring isn't exactly clear but it obviously doesn't involve anything as worthless to survival as love.<BR><BR>

You could attempt to make the case that love is merely a facet of some logical process (and you may have in the latter half of your article, I didn't read it all), but you would be incorrect. Many human beings make choices in mates that are entirely wrong, regardless of what measure you use. We feel love because we have constructed the emotion of love, and it is often almost completely illogical.<BR><BR>
By the way, have you been reading anything by Peter Singer lately?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I at least stated that I was assuming. I just think along these lines:
<BR>

<BR>
There are other highly intelligent social creatures on this planet - namely dolphins and apes. The process they go through to find mates and the feelings involved cannot be that different from ours simply because 20,000 years ago we were not that much different from them socially. I doubt any animal on this planet is actually thinking about propagating their genetic material. More likely they actually find more fit individuals of the opposite sex more attractive. So a feeling of lust rather than a functional need to pass on their genes.
<BR>

<BR>
I would argue that where human mate selection differs from animal mate selection is down to the fact that humans no longer have to fight for survival. Even the most weakest human is guaranteed survival in our society - therefore any prerequisite a female has for a strong male mate no longer need apply to humans.<BR>&lt;&lt;JUMP!

<i>The process they go through to find mates and the feelings involved cannot be that different from ours simply because 20,000 years ago we were not that much different from them socially.</i><BR><BR>
20,000 years ago we were quite a bit different from them socially.<BR><BR>

<i>I doubt any animal on this planet is actually thinking about propagating their genetic material.</i><BR><BR>
You are right. The desire to propagate is instinctual, so they don't have to think about it. I would imagine that if you could get inside of the minds of most animals, apes, dolphins, frogs, chickens, whatever, you would find something along the lines of "Gotta find food.....don't get killed.....gotta find food.....don't get killed". Of course that is entirely conjecture on my part but it fits with their behavior.<BR><BR>

<i>More likely they actually find more fit individuals of the opposite sex more attractive.</i><BR><BR>
If by 'attractive' you mean 'fit'.<BR><BR>

<i>So a feeling of lust rather than a functional need to pass on their genes.</i><BR><BR>
No. Consider the Australian redback spider. Females of the species often mate with three of four males during the breeding season and the one who's sperm actually fertilizes the egg sac is usually the one who can deposit the most in the female. Similar to the black widow, the females often consume the male shortly after mating is complete. You would think, if driven by love, or cold logic, or anything like that, the male would try to escape so that he could preserve his own life. Not in this case, the males actually <b>encourage</b> the females to eat them! They do this becuase it prolongs copulation and allows them to deposit greater amounts of sperm inside the female. Amazing, but the drive to continue the lineage is even stronger than the spider's desire to live.<BR><BR>

<i>any prerequisite a female has for a strong male mate no longer need apply to humans.</i><BR><BR>
This is untrue. While I agree that many, many humans (mostly Western ones) make terrible choices when choosing mates, there is still a very strong desire, conscious or not, to choose the fittest mate. Western cultures demonstrate fitness by buying expensive cars, diamonds, homes. In Africa, women make slits in their lips and insert clay plates. The larger the plate the more desirable the woman. Maybe there is logic in there somewhere, I don't know, but it is definitely an attempt to seduce another person into the social construct humans call love or, more likely, to obtain the best possible mate.

<BR>
You imply that they think like some sort of robots. Just because they are less intelligent than us? 
<BR>
If we made contact with a more intelligent alien species couldnt they think we have no free will? After all they would probably argue that we only show the most basic behaviour.
<BR>

<BR>
An chimpanzee can learn, it can socially interact, it can communicate, It can use tools, they can play (unnecessary for survival!), they are sad when a close relative dies.
<BR>
Just because they dont build things doesnt make them automatically disqualified for having free will. Just because their behaviour or emotions can be considered just basic versions of our own doesnt mean they dont have free will - it just means they are less intelligent.
<BR>

<BR>
A grown up chimpanzee has the IQ of a young human child. Are you arguing that children think like robots too? "must eat, dont get killed"
<BR>
All the evidence points to the conclusion that if humans have free will then so do other highly intelligent animals. Unless you believe the bible in which case you believe animals have no free will regardless.

Because the brain areas responsible for humor are principially the same both for humans, apes, and dolphins. Be accurate.

I however believe that things like humour are pretty deterministic. Further studies of the responsible brain areas will shed more light at this, and I suppose they will confirm my opinion.

Do you realize that that is a completely illogical and senseless phrase?</i>
<BR><BR>
Not if you think over it.
<BR><BR>
In systems where structure determines function - ie, brain - structural similarities suggest functional similarities.
<BR><BR>
<i>Do you mean that these "areas" are the same in chemical composition? Biological structure? What exactly do you mean by "principally the same"?</i>
<BR><BR>
Similar - close to identical - in structure ("wiring"), both macro- and microscopical.<br>
Take a human brain, and an animal brain. Damage the same area of them. You will observe impairment or complete failure of a function handled by that area, the same for both species.
<BR><BR>
<i>The cells in your finger are "principally the same" as the cells in an earthworm. Does that imply that your finger lives underground and eats dirt?</i>
<BR><BR>
The cells themselves are similar, thus they are likely to (and are) behave similarly, use the same biochemical pathways (ie, Krebs cycle). However, the similarity ends here as my finger is part of me and earthworm is an entity of its own; my finger lacks the structures necessary for its own independent existence; you aren't comparing apples and oranges here - you are comparing apples and orange trees.

That said:<BR><BR>
<i>An chimpanzee can learn, it can socially interact, it can communicate,</i><BR><BR>
So can virtually every other animal on earth. What is it about social interaction and structure that is so wonderful? Chickens in the barnlot have a very strict social hierarchy and a very definite set of rules they all must follow.<BR><BR>

<i>It can use tools</i><BR><BR>
That means little more than having a social structure does. I have seen otters use rocks to crack open mussel shells, are they our brothers too?<BR><BR>

<i>they can play (unnecessary for survival!),</i><BR><BR>
I admit they play but their play, like that of most other animals, is just practice for their adult life where they will need to run to escape predators, climb trees, leap from limb to limb. The young of big cats do the same thing, only they practice the skills they will need to catch prey. Virtually all mammals 'play', but it should rightly be called practice, and is by many wildlife biologists.<BR><BR>

<i>A grown up chimpanzee has the IQ of a young human child.</i><BR><BR>
I would question the methods used to determine a chimp's IQ.<BR><BR>

<i>Are you arguing that children think like robots too? "must eat, dont get killed"</i><BR><BR>
Very young ones, yes. That doesn't mean that they don't possess free will.<BR><BR>

<i>All the evidence points to the conclusion that if humans have free will then so do other highly intelligent animals.</i><BR><BR>
I have yet to see the evidence of which you speak, does it exist only inside your own head?<BR><BR>

<BR>
So why are you making a special exception of one trait - free will?
<BR>

<BR>
"So can virtually every other animal on earth"
<BR>
No, chimpanzees can learn and pass information down generations by teaching. Other animals seem to do this genetically. Almost everything humans can do, chimpanzees can do but on a simpler level. 
<BR>
Why do you refuse to believe that this might be true? are you scared that the specialness of humanity would be eroded slightly?
<BR>

<BR>
Apes playing isnt anything to do with practice. They arent preditors. They dont need to play chase. If it was a purely suvival based game then you would expect it to end after many generations of captivity. But no, they are simply getting fun out of playing. It serves no purpose to them - maybe indirectly they are learning something out of playing but so is a child learning something out of their playing.
<BR>

Im only arguing using chimpanzee's because its a lot easier to compare them to humans than it is to compare another species with humans.

You should learn to be more sceptical of research done by people who have a larger agenda.

It leads to things like Top Ten lists of intelligent animals, based entirely on the similarities shared with humans. If we can't accept animals for what they are then I don't see how we will ever come to respect them.<BR><BR>
The original diary entry mentions 'many other animals'. It was then distilled down to dolphins (most likely because they are always smiling) and various primates, because they look like us. I attempted to interject that there were many other animals outside the Top Ten lists that showed quite a bit of specialized adaptation, some of it remarkable in its complexity and bordering on what many people would term intelligence. Unfortunately, as most 'animals are people too' debates go, it devloved into an excercise to determine the worth of various animals by whether or not they can be taught to sign after being stripped from their natural environment and caged up.<BR><BR>
It is entirely possible that you, Potato, and I all share a similar goal. I would like for everyone to recognize that non-human species have value outside of the economy. They, like us, have an ecological niche to fill. The chimp exists to feed the cheetah. The cheetah exists to control the chimp population. Neither exists to stack boxes in cages and the worth of neither should be based on their ability to do so. Just because one will come when you call it 'Koko' means nothing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So for an animal so similar and directly related to us as chimps, its remarkable that we automatically assume chimps to be hugely different from us.

Because thats what it is - saying humans have free will and chimps dont implies a huge difference.

<BR>

<BR>
Its good to be sceptical but its not good to have a closed mind.
<BR>

<BR>
First that research I pointed to where the apes stacked boxes and constructed sticks was done in the 1920's - maybe u noticed the photos were black and white. This was a time where there was no agenda to be had. It was pure scientific research. An ape joined to sticks together to make an extended stick without being told how! if that isnt making tools what is? Apes stacked up crates to allow them to reach food - again if that isnt construction of a tool then what is?
<BR>

<BR>
Wont you be satisfied until they invent the wheel?
<BR>

<BR>
Why are you so adament that because apes cant make complex tools they dont possess free will? 
<BR>
That they cant make as complex tools as humans is down to intelligence and you've already stated that intelligence doesnt equal free will. 
<BR>

<BR>
Chimps are more like humans than like other animals. Do you disagree with this?
<BR>

<BR>
Thousands of years ago there were two species of human - do you believe the other species didnt possess free will?
<BR>

<BR>
One more question. If you believe that free will only exists in humans would you change your mind if we found a highly intelligent alien species elsewhere in the universe? and how would you react if they thought we were stupid creatures who didnt have free will?<BR>&lt;&lt;JUMP!

You think early humans made tools for fun?
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe apes arent intelligent enough to make tools on a level you find acceptable but like you said intelligence doesnt equal free will. Therefore that they cant make tools to the same level as us doesnt reflect that they have no free will.
<BR>

<BR>
Some humans are mentally handicapped and could never make tools - doesnt mean they dont have free will does it?

So, by your logic, chimps should have produced twice as many tools as humans, given that they have four opposable thumbs. Their world should look something like a Jetsons cartoon by now.<BR><BR>

<i>This was a time where there was no agenda to be had.</i><BR><BR>

If by 'more like' you mean that we share many morphological characteristics..<BR><BR>

<i>Thousands of years ago there were two species of human -</i><BR><BR>

No, although maybe you need to clarify. The early <i>Homo</i> species (we are <i>Homo sapeins</i>) most likely evolved from fossils of the genus Australopithecus. Australopithecus is split into two types, gracile and robust, the gracile are probably our direct ancestors. Your post might be referring to these two 'species of human', although you would be incorrect is using those terms, two species of ape would be more correct. Your timeline is also a bit off as <i>Homo habilis</i> shows up in the fossil record around 2.5 million years ago. Maybe you were referring to the later descendants of Australopithecus, <i>Homo erectus</i> and <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>, who appear about 300,000 years ago. If so, please discuss their respective differences and the reasons why one of them longer exists, and also show that free will was not a matter of importance between the two.<BR><BR>

<i>If you believe that free will only exists in humans would you change your mind if we found a highly intelligent alien species elsewhere in the universe?</i><BR><BR>
I would probably not change my mind unless, in addition to being intelligent, they also demonstrated free will.<BR><BR>

<i>would you react if they thought we were stupid creatures who didnt have free will?</i><BR><BR>
I would probably argue with them I guess. I really haven't spent much time thinking about that one (probably because I am not a fan of sci-fi) and I am not sure why anyone would bother to do so.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Not at all.

I'd challenge you to say that to any father you know, and get a positive (or even not entirely incredulous) response. There is more to paternal love than just supporting one's child physically so it survives...<b>for human beings</b>. This seems to be where you are not grasping the difference between people and animals.<BR><BR>

Have you ever actually been in a long-term, committed relationship?!?? Based on this sentence, apparently not. Marriage and other committed relationships are based on a complex interplay of values and emotions and are built, sometimes excruciatingly, over a period of time. I didn't just get a whiff of my husband's pheromones (sp?) in a bar and instinctively decide that he was the best genetic hope for my offspring to survive.<BR><BR>

Its amazing how you claim to be know for sure  how animals think and feel. We cant have a clue how other animals think because we're human - so how can you even make that statement? 
<BR>
Instead we must use observed evidence to back up either side and there is a very large ammount of evidence showing that animals probably feel emotions just as humans do.
<BR>

<BR>
I dont believe there is a clear line between humans and animals as you are implying. I believe there is a spread - chimpanzees are much more like humans than sheep for example. If an alien race visited this planet would they really decide that humans have free will but chimps dont? More likely they would find us hard to distinguish other than intelligence.
<BR>

<BR>
You only say that humans have free will because you are human and observe that you have free will.
<BR>
You cant possibly know without evidence whether a chimp has free will or not. And this evidence just doesnt exist. With so many similarities between us and chimps we must assume that they do also have free will like us. It would be strange to assume that they are different in this one respect when they are so similar in many others.
<BR>
It should be the norm to assume that they do possess free will and the work should be to prove that they dont.
<BR>

<BR>
Marriage and other committed relationships are just creations of our society not a trait of the individual human. 2000 years ago there was no such thing as marriage - further back and there was no such thing as relationships. Hardly a special trait - more likely it was developed like our technology was developed.
<BR>

<BR>
Amazing that you think animals "get a whiff of pheromones and instinctively decide the best genetic hope for their offspring to survive.". How do you know this? how do you possibly know how animals think and feel? 
<BR>
In fact Chimpanzees dont emit pheromones - just like humans. Yet another of a seemingly million similarities. They must rely on something other than "instinctive decision" to find a mate.

<BR>
Theres a difference between something being predictable and actually being able to predict something.
<BR>
I used the weather as an example - the weather is predictable but the climate is so complex that we cant do it 100% accurately and never will be able to. 
<BR>

<BR>
I make the same argument with human behaviour - that it is possible to predict it but we would never be able to get all the information required to make that prediction. by information i mean the exact state of mind of the given person and every variable existing in the environment around them.
<BR>

<BR>
An almighty being - such as god would be able to know all this information and so would be able to predict human behaviour.
<BR>

Circuits for emotions are located in limbic area of the brain. It is possible to trigger some emotions only by electrical stimulation of the brain in this area. Because the construction details of human and animal brains are strikingly similar, and because of some related experiments, I consider it strong indication that animals have emotions.

Beaver can cut trees to build some of the most amazing dams you'll see, they can even detect the water flow through a pipe that is put through a dam to allow drainage, and dam that up as well. They are so skilled and precise that most of their trees fall all the way to the ground and don't get caught up in the other trees surrounding them.<BR><BR>

There is a species of spider that builds a web composed of several thin, vertical strands that are under very high tension (thus break easily). It then crisscrosses the vertical strands with horizontal ones that are very loose. When a bug stumbles into the web the vertical strands break and the entire web jerks the bug off the ground and suspends it in the air.<BR><BR>

There is an aphid that covers itself with a waxy substance secreted from the tree where the aphid lives, possibly because the wax has an extremely bitter taste that birds, a predator of aphids, don't like. Ants feed on this aphid's excrement and thus live in a symbiotic relationship with it, attacking all predators that threaten to harm their defenseless friend. Interesting for sure, but it gets better: A certain type of beetle loves to eat the aphid but it can be easily repelled by the army of ants surrounding it. To get at its most favorite food the beetle will cover its own body with the waxy substance (it even has specialized hooks molded into its exoskeleton for the purpose) and work its way into a colony of aphids incognito. There ruse is so good that the ants are even fooled, and the beetle has unfettered access to an entire colony of foodstuffs.<BR><BR>
All of these traits I mention are passed down from generation to generation, but through the genes rather than through the teachings of the parent. Studies of beaver have indicated that when food is short the kits will often be forced to leave the lodge at the age of about 1 year. Kits this young will exhibit almost random behavior, going around chewing on trees with no real purpose. Once they mature (about 2 years) they begin showing some 'engineering skill' by constructing dams and lodges and cutting trees particularly suited for those purposes. Obviously, the parents didn't teach them these skills, it is almost as if the skills were 'awakened' in them by nature right at the time when their parents would normally send them out on their own.<BR><BR>
You keep ascribing human characteristics to animals. We are different in ways too numerous to count. Germaine to this particular thread is free will, something you seem to be confusing with specialized behavior brought about by natural selection.

My argument is based on an assertion that if chimpanzees can be shown to be very similar to humans then its very strange to propose that they are very different in one trait called free will.
<BR>

<BR>
To show that chimpanzees are similar to this this I am showing how they have culture, technology and intelligence just like us.
<BR>

<BR>
As you have said, intelligence doesnt equal free will. It doesnt matter that chimpanzees have a more basic culture, technology and intelligence than us as by your statement this doesnt mean they have no free will.
<BR>

<BR>
Just by having basic traits as us, they are simply basic humans and we must therefore conclude that they do have free will. Even if its basic. Although how you can have *basic* free will is beyond me - its not really quantifiable. I reckon they simply have it like we have it. But they just have less intelligence for it to use.

Remeber Washoe the chimp who was taught sign language - i didnt know this but the chimps at that research centre not only use this sign language to communicate to the humans but also to each other. Chimps have also been observed to pass down these signing skills to the next generation without human intervention.

There is so much observed evidence to imply that apes may be less intelligent than humans but can perform all the abilities that we do that it should be contraversial to suggest that they havent got free will - not the other way round.

I disagree that humans are different than animals because of free will.
<BR>
Frankly, if humans have free will then I expect apes and dolphins have free will too. There simply is not much difference between humans, apes and dolphins on an intelligence level. We are slightly more intelligent but their brains work similar to ours - their social habits are very closely matching to ours.
<BR>
Also noone can actually prove that humans have free will. You are not only saying that this is "obvious" but also go on to assert that animals dont have free will. Do you know this from fact or implied evidence or are you reading it from some "humans are special" book?

<BR>

<BR>
Dolphins can recognise their own reflection in a mirror - ants cannot. Dolphins display emotions and high level social behaviour - even fighting between rival groups, not much different from our 
<BR>
wars. Maybe if dolphins had limbs to build things you would change your mind. Unfortunately they are restrained to living a purely social existance.
<BR>
Ants are no different to mere robots. Sure the collective of many ants is very organised and productive but it hardly proves that a single ant is more intelligent than a dolphin.
<BR>

<BR>
2. I dont believe in free will personally. I believe that we have a fake perception that free will exists - we believe we can make decisions. 
<BR>
We cannot forsee the future therefore we cannot forsee our actions. That is where the illusion of choice comes from.
<BR>
But lets take this perception of free will - im sure that many other animals will also percieve free will too. 
<BR>
Of course many animals such as ants can be explained as robots - we dont need to explain them as having free will. But with apes is is much more difficult. Go to a zoo and watch the monkeys - see how similar they behave to children. As behaviour is the only thing we can use to judge whether an animal has free will or not, we must assume that monkeys do simply because they behave so similar to us. Ie when humans play chase you would say that the chaser and the runner both have free will over their actions. Why do you think its so different when monkeys play chase?
<BR>
You seem to be assuming a massive gap between the intelligence of humans and animals which in reality isnt that big at all.
<BR>

<BR>
3. So you are simply believing in free will because you are scared of the alternative?

<BR><BR>

The thing is that ants have a highly developed technological culture -- and, what's more, this culture is <b>not predetermined biologically</b>.

In other words, the technological culture of ants constantly changes to adapt to changing environments. Ants are the only animals besides man who can (and <b>do</b>) use complex tools.

<BR><BR>

The fact that a single ant is less complex than a single dolphin bears little relevance to our discussion; if we were to compare honestly, we should compare by biological mass, not by some unscientific principle of "one organism".

<BR><BR>

A single ant cannot survive on its own any more than a chopped-off finger can survive on its own. 

<BR><BR>

These rankings of "intelligence" of animals are simply bogus and have no scientific value whatsoever; basically, what they attempt to measure is how "close" biologically an animal is to a human. This has absoluitely no relevance to the issue of intelligence.

<BR><BR>

P.S. You, personally, don't have to believe in free will. Disbelieving in free will is one of the stupidest tenets of the liberalist faith.

I see what you mean now. But there are millions of ways we could interpret the word intelligence. I would argue that ants are more intelligent than humans because they follow orders without question. Also they never invented weapons of mass destruction. Clearly they and all other animals on earth are more intelligent than humans on this basis.
<BR>

<BR>
Or, we could use the common interpretation of intelligence - ie the intelligence of an individual.

Is a single ant more intelligent than a dolphin? If you are saying that this comparison cant be done then: is a greenfly more intelligent than a human?

Wow you are admitting that animals can have culture! You also admit that some species can use tools. Add in that many species can also feel emotion (denying this is simple arogance), can use complex communication, can behave in a way not necessary for survival - ie the function of a concious creature not a robot and you must realise that animals can perform the same operations as humans - the only difference is we have advanced these operations to be more complex.

Yes. Like I said in another comment, I'm involved in AI "research", so this isn't just be blowing hot air -- I don't believe "artificial intelligence" in the sense you give the phrase will ever be developed.

<BR><BR>

The problem is precisely the lack of a formal definition of "intelligence"; most AI researchers agree that a prerequisite for true "intelligence" is self-awareness, but defining "self-awareness" is even more tricky than defining "intelligence" in the first place. That gets us nowhere.

<BR><BR>

The problem is that before we can solve any problem, the problem first needs to be formalized in a deterministic way. (I assume that's what you mean when you say "described logically".) 

<BR><BR>

We've had absolutely no luck so far formalizing "intelligence" -- most people intuitively agree that the task is simply impossible. 

<BR><BR>

In fact, in recent years there has been a tendency to redefine "artifical intelligence" to mean "solving tasks in problem-specific areas that require some sort of mental effort".

<BR><BR>

Quite a difference, don't you think!

Most of what ive been taught and read about it is about expert systems and heuristics and using genetic algorithms to solve things. Not really intelligence so much as a complicated logical system. I most definitely have a lower understanding of the field than you.
<BR>

<BR>
I also made a screw up when I used the phrase "described logically". If a sentinent artificial intelligence is ever to be built it will be the construction of a processing system in which its total compexity is more than the added complexity of its parts. That is, for example, things like emotions and feelings and conciousness wouldnt be programmed but would manifest themselves as products of the working system. 
<BR>
Eg, Something as simple as a few rules of how water acts with air pressure and temperature can create massive unpredictable systems such as hurricanes. Sorry that I keep using the weather all the time as examples.
<BR>
So no, I dont really expect the creators of a sentinent AI to have to logically explain things such as conciousness and emotion beforehand. But afterwards we would get a massive jump in understanding of these concepts.
<BR>

<BR>
There would also be some sort of boundary of intelligence where the AI itself could then make itself more intelligent. Scary thought that something could simply raise its intelligence to unknown levels.
<BR>
Doing this is a very complex task and thats why I dont think its been accomplished yet. But I have no doubt that one day it will be.

Anyways, you are right -- the most promising developments in AI (sctrictly in my opinion, of course) are precisely those that try to harness the "god in the machine". In other words, methods that use some sort of self-developing or evolutionary methods.

The idea is that since we cannot formalize intelligence, we might try to set up some simple initial conditions and see if intelligence will spontaneously self-generate.

Not necessarily. The possibility of something doesn't mean it has to happen all the time. Even the chain itself doesn't necessarily have to have hierarchical structure; it is most likely a complicated web full of cycles and feedbacks. Typical chaotical system.

None in principle, except details related to the implementation. A burning smell is perceived real regardless of it is a real smell, a result of artificial electrical stimulation, a result of hypnosis, or a result of a epileptic petit-mal.

Good and bad are relative concepts. If I will kill you, it will be bad for you, but good for the ants.

Here's a random question. Suppose it is possible to simulate reality in the most accurate way, so virtual is absolutely indistinguishable from real. Does it then still give sense to distinguish between real and virtual?

However if mad scientist is implying that we will be able to predict human actions using the workings of the brain then I strongly disagree.
<BR>
Yes, a persons actions are manipulated by their environment - other people and the natural world.
<BR>

<BR>
Nathan is right - the number of variables involved to therefore calculate any accurate prediction of a persons actions are too numerous for us to ever be able to store (let alone gather). Even with DNA computers.
<BR>

<BR>
I also dont think there needs to be a ultimate control of a person - such as a soul. Humans can drive themselves. You may argue that there has to be some controlling body somewhere down the line but look at the weather system - where is the controlling body for that? There is none - it is completely recursive. 
<BR>

<BR>
The weather system is such a good example of a 100% explainable, logical system which because of its complexity is unpredictable.
<BR>
The human brain is probably exactly the same.
<BR>

<BR>
If we are brains in a vat - so what? science only goes out to explain the reality we see - which by the way is all we have. If it turns out that this reality is wrong and we are brains in a vat then science will simply adjust to trying to explain the new reality.

Therefore I dont have "faith" in maths but a safe assumption or trust that so many people couldnt possibly all lie at the same time. Its not even trust - its stronger than trust - its common sense based.
<BR>

<BR>
Believing that number theory is a lie would be to accept that every mathematician is a liar. Believing something like that would make you worse than the people who say the moon landings were faked and everyone working for NASA was in on it.

As a question, if R means real number what does N, Z and C mean?

I'd guess that N means a set of natural numbers (positive integers, though I am not sure if 0 is included - reportedly there are two definitions, one defining N as positive (excluding 0), one as non-negative (including 0)), Z (a set of whole numbers - integers, both positive and negative), C (a set of complex numbers - like a lot of arguments here having real and imaginary part).

To make things complicated, "1+1=2" is true only for scalars. If we'll take this example to the realm of vectors, then - depending on the relative direction of the vectors, which isn't specified now - 1+1 equals to anything between 0 and 2.

Working backwards from the heavy-handed references, I assume you're either going to use the halting problem as some reason why we can't simulate everything, given an infinite amount of computing power, or you're going to be banging on about a mathematical representation not being applicable to reality. Either way, a minimum quota of one book or author reference per comment will be fulfiled.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This reminds me so much of those little "anti-GPL" and "Linux terrorist" articles. Of course I was the one stating the above quote on those.

<BR>
So in respect I will do what you say and shut up as I know how it feels to have people talking bullshit about a factual subject you know about and continuously refuse to belive they are talking bullshit. When they tell you that you're wrong although you know that you're 100% right because its a fact - just like if someone telling you that coffee is spelt with a 'k' and refused to believe you when you told them that its a 'c'. Infuriating.

<BR><BR>
A bit overscaled proposition. As a brain is only a part - a subset - of the universe, its computational capacity and address space is only a subset of the universe's one. But this is only a nitpicking.
<BR><BR>
<i>No doubt quantum computers will bridge that particular gap - and if not them, the DNA models.</i>
<BR><BR>
Maybe you are closer than you think. See A. Mershin - <a href="http://people.physics.tamu.edu/mershin/quantbio.html">The Quantum Brain Hypothesis</a>.
<BR><BR>
Maybe this is our future key - or its part - to sentient machines. It could be fun to put some together - watching the philosophers babbling about their implications would be a reward on its own :)
<BR><BR>
Maybe this could be also part of the key of brain-computer interface, the ultimate objective of user interface technologies...
<BR><BR>
<i>I notice that you did not address my question about the arbitrariness of any human being's ideas in the face of a mechanical universe. I rephrase: "If all is contingent and without intrinsic value, by what standards could we ever say anything is good or bad?"</i>
<BR><BR>
We can't say anything is good or bad without specifying thee criteria for goodness/badness first. There are many sets of such criteria - philosophers are arguing about them for ages.
<BR><BR>
<i>I also notice that you accepted my proposition that, as it stands, we constantly manipulate our own neurology.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yep. And we aren't alone. Elephants are willing to walk long distances to indulge their appetite for fermented fruit, containing alcohol - de facto to inebriate themselves. Similar behavior observed in many other species, including insect.
<BR><BR>
<i>What makes you think that doing so with lasers and wires will be "better" than doing it with social interaction, internal pondering, and drugs?</i>
<BR><BR>
Had I said it would be better (or worse)? These are just another methods, with all their associated advantages/disadvantages.
<BR><BR>
<i>And, I repeat, "better" for whom?</i>
<BR><BR>
Again, define the framework for defining of better/worse.
<BR><BR>
<i>Good and bad are relative from some sort of "objective" point of view. You might be interested in knowing that the first philosophy paper I ever wrote was on the topic of this kind of "objectivity." I concluded that objectivity cannot be experienced by any human being because the ways that we perceive and think.</i>
<BR><BR>
Not entirely. But it should be possible to get pretty close. It also requires to know the ways we perceive and think, in order to take appropriate corrections into account.
<BR><BR>
<i>You can't see a simple brick from every conceivable angle and distance, at every imaginable level of resolution, from within and without simultaneously, etc.</i>
<BR><BR>
Right. Guess why there isn't an "universal" projection in an engineering, nor any universal visualisation method for scientific models. Each such projection or method is here to emphasize different aspect. 
<BR><BR>
<i>In other words, all our information about the universe is extremely limited.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yes. But it's getting better.
<BR><BR>
<i>The only way you could make a claim to know an object "objectively" would be to know it from every possible [human] perspective, rather than simply your own.</i>
<BR><BR>
Hard to achieve. Second alternative is to figure out our subjective limits, and take precautions about them.
<BR><BR>
<i>In fact, everything we know we know with a high degree of subjectivity, as any anthropologist would tell you.</i>
<BR><BR>
I have certain prejudice against "soft sciences". Their methods allow way too much of subjectivity.
<BR><BR>
<i>In other cultures, perception of space and time is known to be so different as to be almost nonsensical from a Western perspective. If these fundamentals are less easily made objective than we had thought, it raises frightening questions about the legitimacy of our claims to objective knowledge.</i>
<BR><BR>
I'd suggest to leave the answers to the fundamentals of space and time to quantum physicists (they don't have conclusive answers yet, but the work is in progress).
<BR><BR>
When it comes to the subjective perception of time, the answers are in the brain structure itself. See ie. <a href="http://unisci.com/stories/20011/0227013.htm">Brain Areas Critical To Human Time Sense Identified</a>, or indirectly related <a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f01/web3/ford.html">Neurotheology: Which came first, God or the brain?</a>. Here also lie the answers about the mechanisms of effects of space and time perception changing means (being it meditations or drugs).
<BR><BR>
<i>And, once again, it raises the question of power.</i>
<BR><BR>
<BR><BR>
<i>Mr Mad Scientist, these ideas are not new. But they are frightening.</i>
<BR><BR>
Why?
<BR><BR>
<i>To answer your last question, we have nothing except to induction to prove to ourselves that we're not brains in vats.</i>
<BR><BR>
Even the induction can fail here.

Your nick is appropriate. Anyone who attempts to communicate with you will eventually go mad. 
I'm at a loss for words. If just dont know what to say.
<BR><BR>
<i>
I am well-aware about the limitations of my methods; the explanations aren't complete and are just an approximation
</i>
<BR><BR>
No, see, your use of the words "complete" and "approximation" suggests you dont understand that scientific ideas are <i>pure invention</i>. 
<BR><BR>
<i>but the approximation is getting closer each time[1]</i>
<BR><BR>
No. The history of science is a history of <i>revolution</i> in <i>ideas</i>, not the gradual, evolutionary approximation of any given idea to reality. Nothing you believe in today will survive; and nothing you believe today  cannot be <i>explained differently</i>, today,  by a competing theory. The latter point is very important to understand -- what is the justification for thinking otherwise? (Hint: shut up, I'm not interested in your answer, your comment history demonstrates the question is to difficult for you to even understand.)
<BR><BR>
<i> In brief example, Newtonian physics -> Einsteinian physics -> Quantum physics -> now promising Superstring theory (we'll see if it'll stay or fall).</i>
<BR><BR>
To quote a solid state physicist, "Fuck strings."  The only reason Theory A is developped over competing theory B is institutional inertia. There is a difference between reality (singular and complete) and its ideological representation<i>s</i>. Each representation is limited to a single thread of reality, the thread we're interested in for one sociological reason or another; and there is an infinite number of such ideological interpretations.
<BR><BR>
You can get any answer you want provided you ask the right questions. The questions you ask prompt the observations you will make. The questions you ask seek to justify the theory you already have in mind.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
If they are accurate enough to be usable - if the theoretical model fits together with the experimental results, including boundary conditions - the model description can be considered an explanation.

Why? As far, for "hard sciences" it works pretty well.

<BR><BR>
You have a theoretical model. You have an experiment or an observation in the "Real World". Their results have to fit together for the entire range of inputs.
<BR><BR>
Simplified example: Newtonian physics is good enough for "small" masses and speeds. But it starts to be inaccurate as the speeds get closer to c.
<BR><BR>
So Newtonian physics had to be abandoned and relativistic physics took its place. Newtonian physics is still usable where its limits don't apply.

Thanks, I have a dictionary, it doesnt help. You're the one wholly infatuated with reductionist, mechanistic "explanations". Tell me why the objects of psychology (economics, anthropology, etc) arent as concrete as the objects of physics. Your optimistic comments on the brain as machine imply they are. So what gives? 
<BR><BR>
What do I care about the "[difficulty of establishing] strictly measurable criteria?" That's something you should think about, if you can spare a few moments from your further self-proselytization;
unlike you, I already understand the theoretical limitations of science. Start by reflecting upon what it might mean to establish criteria and ask yourself if the established criteria for measuring inanimate objects reflects the object as much as it reflects how we rank importance in our perceptions of that object. After all, objects dont have criteria.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Humans are special because we are sentinent beings. That means we can see and think about the universe. We might as well be sheep or rats if we dont use this ability as im sure they're happy too.

"There is more to life than science, 'proofs' and logic, you know"
<BR>
Not if life is logical. 
<BR>

<BR>
As it is I think humanity is a flawed species. While we can develop technologically very fast we are socially static. We have hardly developed past such negative and damaging emotions as hate and lust - emotions we dont need anymore. We still have a need to get revenge. While we can see that scrapping revenge lust would be a good thing we are incapable of doing it.
<BR>

<BR>
So while we screw about on Earth fighting each other and just being content and happy without bothering to advance ourselves socially a big asteroid or climate shift with our name on is heading this way to wipe us out. 
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe one day in our place will be a species which can advance fast socially and technologically. The ultimate species that has a chance of actually getting off this planet and colonising.

<BR><BR>
Oh, hey, hey-- check out this song.  Yeah, <i>Paul's Boutique</i>.  That's Pink Floyd in the background, <i>Dark Side</i>.  Isn't that cool?  No, it's not in the liner notes, stupid.  This was before the RIAA fucked everything up and started charging money for sampling.  
<BR><BR>
Those bastards.  My demo would be done already if I didn't have to figure out something to replace all those beats, dude.  It sucks.  Totally.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR>
I used the world theoretically for a reason.
<BR>

<BR>
It will never be possible to accurately predict a persons actions. We would first have to take account of every single influence on that person.
<BR>
How many influences are there? billions billions.
<BR>

<BR>
Every air molecule passing by that person would have to be accurately mapped. It sounds stupid that the position of one air molecule could affect an influence on that person but under chaos theory a small change like this in a big system can cause a wildly different outcome.
<BR>

<BR>
Therefore humans will never be predictable :)
