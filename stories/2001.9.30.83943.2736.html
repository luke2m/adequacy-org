		This week saw the release of the latest and greatest version of the Linux
operating system, Linux Mandrake 8.1. Although "alternative" operating
systems are not usually of interest to <A
HREF="../index.html">Adequacy</A>'s readership, who prefer to
trust user-friendly commercial software, this release is noteworthy. For
the release of Linux Mandrake 8.1, aggressively timed to coincide with
that of Microsoft's much vaunted <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/">Windows XP</A>, marks the start
of the final battle for domination of the computer industry. Make no
mistake, the next few months will either see Microsoft tighten its
stranglehold on the marketplace or will be a coming of age for the upstart
Linux operating system.<P> Considering the enormous significance of this
release, we at Adequacy are proud to bring you one of the first ever
reviews of Linux Mandrake 8.1.<P>
<b>[editor's note, by bc] Due to enormous user feedback, we have done our best to correct some errors in this article. Hopefully it should be 100% correct now.</b>        </div>

<I>Storm</I> and <I>Coral</I>. In stark contrast to the mundane names such
as <I>98</I>, <I>ME</I> or <I>NT</I> preferred by Microsoft, the crazy   
names of each Linux release hint at its renegade nature.<P>

My foray into the world of Linux began by downloading a "CD image" from   
the Linux web site. But don't worry, this isn't software piracy, it's   
perfectly legal! Linux is shareware, meaning that it can be freely
redistributed without fear of a visit by the <A
HREF="http://www.bsa.org">Business Software Alliance</A>.  The free
availability of Linux is a major reason for its popularity among
cash-strapped students and self-styled <A
HREF="http://www.fsf.org">anti-capitalist hackers</A>.<P>

Before installing new software, it is always advisable to read the
documentation. Unfortunately, an unpleasant surprise was in store for me  
in the "required configuration" section of the <A
HREF="ftp://jungle.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/mandrake/Mandrake/8.1/i586/INSTALL.txt">manual</A>.
I was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on Pentium
processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old <A
HREF="http://www.gateway.com">Gateway</A> 486 were dashed. Furthermore, a
whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Linux! Although the <A
HREF="http://www.slashdot.org">advocates</A> of Linux self-righteously
boast the efficiency of their chosen operating system and deride the
"bloatware"  produced by Microsoft, it appears that their claims are
blatantly incorrect. Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95,  
it seems that Linux requires far more powerful, and more expensive,
computer hardware. Is this really the sign of a lean, mean operating system?
Of course not.<P>

Sadly, not even being able to install Linux is just the first of my many 
complaints. A brief perusal of the <A
HREF="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1227">
features of Linux Mandrake</A> reveals that Linux is sorely lacking many
crucial productivity applications. For example, why isn't the industry
standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?  Despite the
best efforts of the experts at the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org">Internet
Engineering Task Force</A> to encourage adoption of the Internet Explorer 
standard, the creators of Linux seem to think that they know better. By
refusing to adhere to recognised standards, Linux is simply undermining
its own credibility.<P>
Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software
is completely incompatible with Linux! It may surprise you to learn that
your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not
work under Linux. Those who wish to use their computer for recreational   
purposes are also out of luck, for almost all of the most popular games  
are unavailable for Linux. Although a wide range of software is freely    
available for Linux, these pitiful offerings are mostly unfinished, unreliable and do not
bear comparison to their commercial counterparts.<P>

Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by
the developers of Linux. In these times when hacking and viruses are
commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no <A
HREF="http://www.mcafee.com">anti-virus software</A> is available for 
Linux. To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular  
<A HREF="http://www.zonealarm.com">ZoneAlarm</A> firewall. By using Linux,
you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the 
Internet.<P>
The shortcomings of Linux are obvious. Without even installing Linux
Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws. Surely it is not too
much to expect that, after ten years of development, the creators of Linux
would have addressed these problems? The real question that the
prospective Linux user must ask himself is, "Why bother?" After all,
Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need  
to replace it, particularly not with a product of inferior quality.<P>

Although it is always tempting to support the underdog, Windows XP will
be the deserved victor in the battle ahead. I recommend that those  
Adequacy readers who are hoping to upgrade their operating system
patiently wait for the release of Windows XP, rather than foolishly
wasting their time, effort and money on Linux.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Excuse me, but you obviously have a very deeply troubled sexuality yourself. It may come as a surprise to you, but "playing hard to get" is <b>not</b> normal human mating strategy. In fact, "playing hard to get" is a euphemism for "I'd prefer to never see you again". It seems that you yourself have some very deep psychological scars vis-a-vis your sexuality. Obviously, you have sublimated frequent cases of rejection by the opposite sex, convincing yourself that abuse and humiliation leveled at you is somehow "normal". In real life, (as opposed to the sublimated virtual construction you have created for yourself) people

who like each other have no problem communicating.

I'd suggest attacking your problem at the root; first of all, you need to take a hard look at yourself. There is no point in keeping the cycle of self-delusion and humiliation going; try to improve your attitude and your outlook on life, try to connect in a more meaningful, non-consumerist way with members of the opposite sex. Start anew with small things -- like chatting about the weather and going out to luch together. Eventually you may break your malignant cycle and establish a meaningful relationship.

<BR><BR>

Best wishes and good luck to you.

But I do need to set you straight on some things.  I went to college once where I was one of those Unix hackers.  (Linux wasn't invented yet
<BR>
nor was the PC)  We wrote great code back then just as now.  Better, even, because we were young and eager and not busy going to soulless business meetings.  And better, because software design is really a young person's skill.  That's why mathematicians (I was a math major) are considered over the hill by the time they're 25.
<BR>
I was also more trustworthy back then, having the ideals of the young and not the pressures to sell out that comes with having to come up with a mortgage payment every month.  And so I say, trust that code of the young.  It's a lot better than what "teams of professionals" turn out in most cases.  I'll bet you were young once too.

Thats not entierly true. Software is by definition a sort of speach. The only difference between a political essay(which is strongly protected by the courts) and source code is that source code has a much much more fuctional porpose. This makes it worthy of less constitutional protection, but it's still speach.

Free software is no Anit-American. It's sharing of ideas. If you want your own source code to be closed source. Nothings stoping you.

You say we should think how many MS stocks we have in our 401K.
<BR>

<BR>
You should think of how much the other companies stock depend on Free Software.
<BR>

<BR>
About half of all internet sites are powered by Free Software.-
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;i&gt;GPL licensed software (of which the linux kernel is an example) is based on the ideas of free and open communication. That is why linux users say their software is free, where the word "free" takes the meaning of the kind of free we associate with speech. This is the freedom we as Americans enjoy under the protection of the 1st Amendment. 
<BR>

<BR>
The internet has allowed the software to become available without a monetary price, thus it is also free as in the kind of free that college students look for (free beer, etc). It is easy to confuse the two, but make no mistake: it is far more important to linux users that their software be the former kind of "free" than the latter. &lt;/i&gt;

This is pure FUD!!!<BR><BR>I would say that Microsoft is closer to Stalin's Soviet Union than a democratic republic.<BR><BR>Do you own the Microsoft software that you are using?  No, you don't.  Microsoft owns it.  you are only allowed to use it because of the EULA.  What happens if there is a bug?  You send a bug report, and wait months for Microsoft to fix it.  Are you allowed to modify the software?  No.  What happens if Microsoft finds out that you installed Windows on your brother's computer?  They will take legal action against you.  Microsoft is very paranoid, even to the point of requiring to request Microsoft's permission to install new hardware on a computer running WindowsXP.  Does this sound democratic?  No.  Does this sound capitalist?  No.  Capitalism rests on the foundations of free enterprise.  Microsoft tries to kill free enterprise by stifling competition and innovation.  Microsoft is a monopolistic power that is more akin to the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union owned the industries, and Microsoft owns the OS.  Read the UTICA agreement, and you will see.<BR><BR>Linux, on the other hand, is American.  It is a truely free operating system.  If something goes wrong, you are free to find the source of the problem and fix it.  You are free to see what goes on in Linux because the source code is there for everyone to see.  If there is a bug, it is not uncommon for there to be a bug fix within hours of a report.  The reason is that people who are enthusiastic about programming work hard to fix the problem.  Unlike the Microsoft paradigm, you own the specific copy of the software you are using.  So I can give a copy to my brother without fear of action.  Not only that, I am free to "look under the hood" and make changes.  You can take Linux and make it your OWN operating system.  You can create scripts to make you system VERY powerful.  Imagine if you are not allowed to open the hood of your car, and if you did, you faced legal action.  Linux allows you to do that.  Not only that, but you can create you own distribution of Linux and sell it.  You can modify the Linux Kernel, and share it with everyone else. <BR><BR>Linux is founded upon the ideal of freedom for computer users.  These people hold ideals like the nation's founding fathers did.  Read these <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">documents</a> by <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</a>.<BR><BR>The philosophy is akin to the American Revolution.  The intention is to bring freedom and democracy to the software world.  The intention is to bring the highest ideals of both individual and communitarian freedoms into computing.  These people are Americans are the very root.  To say otherwise means that either you hate freedom, or you possess ignorance.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Microsoft produces a relatively easy to use operating system. It is easy to use simply because it is ubiquitous and a great amount of research has been focused on the user interface.
<BR>

<BR>
There is a highly standardized development model which makes programming under the Windows platforms very straightforward. Much of the development layer is documented in a clean and professional fashion.
<BR>

<BR>
Multimedia aspects work wonderfully, as evidenced by Windows Media Player 6.4 on up and the automatic downloading of appropriate codecs.
<BR>

<BR>
Business and productivity software are at the top, though there aren't many more new features which can be packed in. Alternatives are rapidly approaching the level of Microsoft Office.
<BR>

<BR>
Those are the major points that initially come to mind. Now for the rebuttals:
<BR>

<BR>
"How can a company be evil that is wilfully giving away free computers preloaded with free copies of their excellent Windows XP operating system?"
<BR>

<BR>
Simple - there's a catch. Market dominance, allowing practices of monopolistic abuse, evidenced by everyone else's subsequent requirement of paying through the nose for an upgrade which has skyrocketed in cost since the government turned a blind eye after the antitrust investigation. Besides, those who receive a free computer will end up having to upgrade it again down the line with more hardware to support the next generation of Windows which will be equally as exorbitant. As for Windows XP being excellent, you're probably right. I've no interest in it, but for average users, there's no reason to take the time to understand exactly how their computer works any more than they would need to take the time to fully understand how their automobile works. For those whom are not content to remain ignorant (this isn't a bad thing, necessarily, as we all rely on each other due to ignorance or inability in some aspect of our lives), learning about the tools we use, no matter how advanced, is an irresistable lure.
<BR>

<BR>
"How can they be the "Borg" (an obscure reference that only Linux nerds seem to "get", alas) when their chairman donates billions annually to charity?"
<BR>

<BR>
Donations do not excuse arrogance, greed or intimidating actions. Put Bill Gates in a middle class position and he would be stepping on his coworkers to get to the top. These kinds of people make good executives, and we all know what dregs of the world they tend to be. For all the intelligence in the world, it can't redeem one from being an asshole.
<BR>

<BR>
"How can their software be called bloated and crashy, yet still hold 90% of the market share in preference to supposedly 'superior' alternatives from Linux and Macintosh?"
<BR>

<BR>
It is a rare occassion that a superior technology is chosen over a less desirable one. The MP3 compressed music format exploded as several significantly more advanced formats were being released. MP3 is a mediocre technology by comparison, yet by chance and popularity, it has reigned as king of the digital music formats. The Apple Macintosh does not need file extensions - those awkward '.txt', '.mp3' and '.doc' style additions to a file name. Apple's usage of metadata was far superior to Microsoft's almost two decades ago, and still is, yet the popularity of Windows took off and eventually exceeded that of the Mac due to extremely aggressive business tactics which Apple refused to take part in. Apple is certainly no saintly entity itself, but the world could have been dominated by Apple instead and there would be enough complaints about it to make it a Microsoft, as it is seen by many even today. The top dog can be an evil bastard. The underdog can entirely good and yet it can be trampled. Corporations are the epitome of everything undesirable in human nature - greed, arrogance, hate, etc... therefore, the corporate world is essentially the battle to be the worst of the worst.
<BR>

<BR>
"The answer is clear: it is sheer jealousy."
<BR>

<BR>
The people who work on Linux have little concern over the success of Microsoft. They are simply disgusted with the myriad problems in Windows which most users never encounter because they use it for everyday activities, such as email, browsing the internet and games. When a developer needs to get something done and has to end up working around the operating system, it is painful. When workarounds comprise half of a program, the developer is inclined to fix the operating system himself. When the operating system can only be fixed by a cabal of egotistical, money-driven businessmen, the developers who know their asses from a hole in the ground throw their hands up and look for a way out. The good are always outnumbered, as the ignorant can be swayed without their knowing. It pays to learn exactly how your car works, otherwise you'll end up being raped without even knowing it.
<BR>

<BR>
"These people are somehow disappointed in the fact that a million pasty-faced 15-year-olds with no job experience are unable to engineer software of the same quality as some of the best minds on this earth."
<BR>

<BR>
I'll only point out that you obviously have no comprehension of the places where most research occurs. Universities across the country are filled with thousands upon thousands whom are as intelligent, if not moreso than anyone at Microsoft's research centers. There are other research centers as well. Xerox PARC, for instance, where so many technologies have arisen and been incorporated into the fabric of today's society that it can be difficult to even keep track of them.
<BR>

<BR>
"They are enraged that giving your software away fails to make you rich. They can't accept that banner ads are not a business plan."
<BR>

<BR>
Banner ads have never been a business plan, no matter how many may have tried to use them as such. You'd do well to point your finger at the dotcom failures before you accuse those who simply follow their interests and create for the greater good because they like to do so. If the world were filled with more of these people, it would be a far better place than the one we have; filled with cutthroat businessmen. Do you think that physicians and surgeons always enter that field of work simply for money? There really are people in this world that realize the futility of monetary aggrandization. Of course, there are plenty of those at Microsoft whom are enjoying their jobs, especially with the lure of financial wealth. The company blinds them, though. I've seen it firsthand. When a person is making a six figure salary, it's hard not to rationalize away the blatantly vicious actions of your employer.
<BR>

<BR>
"Sorry, Linux heads, communism doesn't work, and no amount of zealotry can help that."
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry for what? This isn't communism. If it were, they would be offering up their apartments and houses for everyone to use. This is the sharing of ideas, not material. You who jump so quickly to accuse the Linux community of communist properties would do well to first examine the scientific community. Linux is branched from computer science, which is still a very raw field. Being a science, it is focused on abstracts - ideas. These ideas can be applied to the material world to create products. The product brought forth by the Linux community is an abstract and therefore an idea, built from other ideas.
<BR>

<BR>
Some in the Linux community make money, most do not. Still, the ideal behind Linux is still very strong. The jealousy you mentioned earlier is simply the over-zealous segments of the community. You misinterpret their calls for change as jealousy because you are blind to the shadows which Microsoft has cast upon a promising industry.
<BR>

<BR>
There has been much damage wrought on the computer industry, and much to correct. However, this is changing. Linux was the poster child and there are others. Microsoft may have 90% of the user market, but the infrastructure of the industry is akin to a living organism and is rejecting the foreign object that threatens it's stability.
<BR>

<BR>
If you've read through this entire rant, I'm impressed. Now, instead of watching TV or playing a video game, go and learn about the world around you.

In the <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/print/2001/6/24/235140/350">words of Richard Stallman</a>:
<BR><BR>
"I did live in my office for 12 years, and I liked it. I was even registered to vote from that address. My situation was unusual because, for the first half of this period, the office was not officially my office and I had no official connection with the lab. I was a squatter in the AI Lab! The very idea is romantic."
<BR><BR>
[...]
<BR><BR>
"Unfortunately there was a new lab director in September 1997, who forced me to stop living in the lab. So I rented a room in Cambridge. At that very time, in October, the MIT student newspaper reported that a many MIT students were still unable to find any housing. The lab director's interference was not only inconvenient and wasteful for me; it also denied one student a possible place to live."<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Granted, there are parallels due to both concepts being idealogical, but enforcement becomes radically different in consequence. On one hand, the decimation of human rights by taking away the capacity of individuality. On the other, there is the continual sharing of ideas and knowledge, basically forcing honesty.

Where lies the danger of free software, aside from that posed to business which tend to stifle research in general?

<BR>
The smaller minority of Linux users who don't just start cursing at you will try to make all kinds of excuses like, "You should have tried Slack Ware instead of Mandrake because the older versions of Linux are better."  Or they will say something like, "Right now Linux isn't very good, but in four years we will have Internet Explorer for Linux and then everyone will only want to use Linux instead of Windows."  These excuses don't cut it for people who have got work to do right away.

<BR><BR>
Now I know you're going to say "freedom isn't free."  But I charitably assumed that when you said "there is no such thing as a free lunch" you were leaving out the possibility of <i>stealing</i> your lunch.  If you allow for taking what isn't yours, then of course you can have lots of things for free.
<BR><BR>
Now, since we are not considering that possiblity, on the assumption that we are speaking only of relations among honorable people, then no honorable person would infringe on your freedom for anything.  Thus, you have your freedom for nothing.  It's free!
<BR><BR>
But as I've said before, free software is much more like sex than anything else:  you get as much as you want for nothing.  Sure you <i>could</i> pay a profesional for it, but why?  If you are capable of giving up as good as you get (again both with sex and software) then you will get better than anything a whore could give you.
<BR><BR>
Now you <i>could</i> be a lousy lay.  Then you will probably not get much good sex for free.  <i>Then</i>, yes, go to a pro.  Absolutely.  
<BR><BR>
Maybe this means that ironically, geeks are the ones least able to beneift from free software.  Just a thought.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

One thing I've noticed is that Linux users make comparisons to free speech and free sex a lot.  This is not necesarilly a bad thing but how far can you take those metaphors?  For example, what about the various positions?  How do they fit in with software and programming?  Is there a Karma Sutra of software that is officially endorsed by the FSF?

As I said before, it's always pleasant to read a well reasoned reply even though it may espouse views that one does not hold himself.

The reasons for microsoft not placing IE on linux is because Microsoft is known to not support Linux in the least, because it is the antithesis of what Microsoft is trying to do. It is also, with other forms of free Unix, taking a substantial amount of the server market from Microsoft. Don't be so quick to say that if Microsoft doesn't support it, it must be flawed in some horrible way.

Also for reference the Solaris version of I.E. is horribly old, so you would probably be better off using another browser under Linux such as Mozilla, its spawnchild Galeon, kmellion, or the horribly unstable Nutscrape Navigator. Furthermore, BSD is it's own operating system, their relationship is that they are both *nix which branched from Bell Labs' original efforts. BSD was developed in UC Berkeley while Solaris evolved from System V, Sun's and AT&Ts effort at unix. Finally, I don't really see why you think its insulting that you make the connection between open source and communism, as communism (or more specifically, socialism) was just too utopian to work. What resulted of attempts at implementing it <i>was</i> quite negative however. Can you really bash them for attempting to achieve a utopian concept?

Of course, Mandrake doesn't run Windows applications -- Linux is set up to be an alternative to Windows, not give Bill Gates even more money. Yeah, Mandrake doesn't run Windows applications; instead, it provides alternate applications that work as as well if not better than Windows apps.
<BR>

<BR>
And you don't have to drive down to the local Best Buy and shell out $100 for Power Point, like a friend of mine had to do this weekend because her college forces her to hand in assignments on Microsoft products. $100 for Power Point and over $400 for the Microsoft Office Suite! Do you people really have that kind of money to burn? I paid about $50 for Mandrake 8.0 on CD a month or two ago, and it includes an office suite.

Why do Linux users always feel they have to belittle non-technical people?  
<BR>

<BR>
Sure you may have time to write your own software or whatever.  And so you think you're pretty smart.  The rest of us don't have so much free time as you and so we don't keep upto date on all this technical stuff.  We just want to get work done.

If this Linus stuff can't run windows applications then that's valuable information for us know.  
<BR>

<BR>
Your sarcastic attitude is a little bit upsetting.  My mother always used to say that, "If you don't have anything good to say then you shouldn't say anything at all."  This seems like a good piece of advice to me.  You should consider it before the next time when you want to say something sarcastic and hurtful to someone who doesn't know everything about computers like you do.

I am not by ANY strech of the imagination a "technical" person. I am a garbage man. and I am Linux user. I don't write programs. I don't know how to write a script file. I rarely use the command line in Linux. and I get work done.

If the author wrote a similar article about Microsoft software, you can bet that he would get an email directly from Microsoft thanking him.  These kind of articles are a marketting departments dream because they tell exactly what things need to be worked on for the next version.

<BR>

<BR>
Or in your mind, would Eistein try to hax0r into the interweb?
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps you imagine Eistein reading Slashdot for 14 hours a day every day?
<BR>

<BR>
You're free to think whatever you want but personally I have far too much respect for Eistein to think he'd use Linux.

<i>The Linux operating system was born in 1991 and was created by one man, a Finnish student coincidentally named Linux Torvalds.</i>
<br><br>
The man's name is LINUS.  The operating system is called Linux because Linus+UNIX=Linux.  No coincidence here, it's all on purpose.
<br><br>
<i>Linux is shareware, meaning that it can be freely redistributed without fear of a visit by the Business Software Alliance.</i>
<br><br>
Linux is not "shareware," it is distributed under the GNU general public license.  Very different from shareware.
<br><br>
<i>I was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on Pentium processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old Gateway 486 were dashed. Furthermore, a whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Linux!</i>
<br><br>
The kernel can be recompiled to run on just about anything, including a 486.  The 32mb memory requirement is a recommendation.  You can certainly run it with 16, just expect lots of paging.  Take a look at your WinXP memory requirements sometime.
<br><br>
<i>For example, why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?</i>
<br><br>The fact that you have to ask that shows how little you know.  If Mandrake tried to include IE in their distro, they would be sued into the stone age.  I won't even try to explain the difference between win32 programs and Linux apps you compile from source.
<br><br>
<i>It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux.</i>
<br><br>
Actually, all of those work using a program called win4lin, which gives you a virtual windows desktop under Linux.  Try it before you say it's impossible.
<br><br>
<i>In these times when hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux.</i>
<br><br>
That's because there aren't really any viruses for Linux.  That, and the basic design of Linux makes it difficult for viruses to do any damage unless you're logged in as root all the time.
<br><br>
<i>To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Linux, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet.</i>
<br><br>
Mandrake includes several firewalls BUILT-IN to the distro, most of which are better than ZoneAlarm.  If there's another one that you like better, just download it since most Linux software is free to use.  Mandrake is more secure out of the box than any version of Windows.
<br><br>
<i>...rather than foolishly wasting their time, effort and money on Linux.</i>
<br><br>
I'll give you that working with Linux might take some additional time and effort for a newbie user, but price?  Please.  Compare the cost of downloading Mandrake and burning it to a cd with buying WinXP at your local CompUSA.
<br><br>
There are a few more errors in this terrible "review" of Mandrake, but I'm too tired to refute them right now.  It's OK to dislike Mandrake or Linux in general, but please, have your facts straight first.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<br><br>
Shareware has limited functionality in order to encourage purchase of the complete product, Linux's limited functionality is as limited as any other operating system: if something hasn't been written for it yet then yes I suppose it is limited because it cant perform the task that you ask of it. The two "limited functionalities" are very, very different. Furthermore, the difference between licenses is that under the GPL (general public license) the source code is free for anyone to distribute, modify, and use in their own projects, as long as credits to the original authors are maintained and that the license is upheld in the subsequent product. The two are <i>very</i> different.
<br><br>
<i>Which means that you can't install it if you don't already have a computer running linux to recompile the kernel specifically for a 486. Duh. The article's complaint stands. He can't install Mandrake in a 486.</i>
<br><br>
Not necessarilly, there are a myriad of sources where one can find precompiled kernels and there are pretty simple methods to install said kernels without having to boot into this version of linux. Also the complaint seems to be aimed at all of Linux, and most Linux distributions allow the user the choice to choose kernels from another media (such as floppy or cd) at install time.
<br><br>
<i>I'm sorry, but if you expect to win over regular desktop users like me, you better speak to us in terms we can understand, not all this propellerspeak (like "paging"-- isn't that what the machine in my belt does?). </i><br><br>
For future reference, it's usually bad practice to criticize someone for answering a technical point (many people wont even understand how ram works, so if you're going to criticize anyone, criticize the ignorant writer of this article) with a technical answer.

<br><br>
<i>Wrong. Since the most popular Lunix distro is famous for security holes (plenty of remote root attacks discovered all the time), there have been successful worms that exploit them. Since this distribution is marketed to people who don't know how to close up the system, and it installs by default all sorts of unneeded exploitable network daemons, that means that for an average windows user like me that doesn't know the meanings of terms like "remote root attack", "network worm", "distribution", "exploit", or "daemon", the virus risk from Linux is much higher than with windows. </i><br><br>
Well even in this case an antiviral program is useless, since protecting against cracking by way of services open to the internet is prevented with firewalls and maintaining current and secure versions of the tools and services running on the system. Antiviral programs do absolutely nothing against worms, because they aren't virii! Hence, no user-level antiviral software is needed.

<br><br>
<i>

<br>

Please do some research before bringing up a point like that. As a matter of fact, the documentation <i>is</i> quite good. Furthermore the users aren't limited by whatever has been packaged with mandrake! This is especially valid since the author once again chooses to bash Linux in general instead of focussing on Mandrake. There countless firewall/packet-filtering packages available for Linux, many of them also with adequate documentation and even some exceptional ones with simple ways to implement basic protection (and zonealarm is quite basic as well).

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Instead of repeating what was said in post #77 (titled "Ha"), I would like to focus on a few points that were left uncovered.
<br><br>
<i>Why do you linux nazis have always to present this argument as if everybody knew how to program a computer (not to mention use one)? No, I don't know how to program; I've never done anything remotely related to programming, and I have no idea of how it works. So the fact that I can theoretically modify Linux makes no difference to me.</i><br><br>
I was simply stating a major difference between shareware and open source software. I was trying to say that just because they are both free, doesn't mean they are the same thing. While having access to source code may not mean a whole lot to the regular non-coding users, it can be a very powerful tool for people that would like to further develop the software or use its existing technology in their own projects. Also source code allows the entire security industry to find exploits in it, and while this may seem like a very negative thing, this open policy also allows for quick patching of holes and doesn't give the end users a false sense of security, which is far worse than to have than no security at all. <br><br>

<i>Eh, the whole distribution is compiled with Pentium optimizations, you need to recompile everything. And I'm sure Mandrake doesn't come with an automated build system such as the ones included with the BSDs, so this is not a simple matter of typing make world as under BSD.</i>
<br><br>
I concede, that is true, though the original article is still horribly flawed by bashing linux in general simply because one of the distributions which is already considered worse than many other more powerful ones (such as debian or slackware, which can in fact run on 486, and debian can even run on the PowerPC architecture as well) by experienced linux users, does not allow the user the option to run it on older systems. The faults of mandrake do not necessarilly reflect on all of Linux. 
<br><br>

<i>I'm sorry, but what's really bad is to try to use words your interlocutor doesn't understand in order to project an aura of superiority without even addressing the arguments. If you want to argue with me, you will please "lower" yourself to my level of tech ignorance.</i><br><br>
I was simply trying to say that an issue which was brought up on a technical level should be addressed on a technical level. The original article does so and I find nothing wrong with refuting it in a technical manner as well. The technical language in the reply was not, as far as I could see, used to create an aura of superiority, therefore I felt that there was nothing wrong with it and it didn't need to be brought down to a level that laymen could understand.<br><br>

Generally with Shareware announcement that after 30 days the program will cease to operate, or the program has certain functions turned off and in order to gain full use of the programs functions register at their website and pay something like 19.95 to get a code/license, enter reg # - full featured program is turned on.
<BR>

<BR>
Freeware - download of the net.  setup, read terms of use/disclaimer - install.  Full featured program.  No mandatory registration to use, can upgrade to a version with more features for a small fee, or not (AkA Zone Alarm, personal version is freeware.  Pro version is Shareware - try it for 30 days and then pay small fee for full time use).  
<BR>

<BR>
GNU public licence.  Freeware with all the source code available to modify, rewrite, tweak at leasure, impliement into what you like (in other words no funny squiggly, abstract symbols and characters that are not intelligible to humans - write in plan uncoded programming language).  Give it to who ever you want.  Basic premiss:  Just like scientific research and publications - you must give credit where credit is due.  In otherwords no plagerism.  You can't take credit for someone else invention (or coding as the case may be).  You can't hijack a program that was writing by several programmers, make a slight change, then run down to the patent office and lock out any further development or charge money for a program that others invented. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not a programmer or in the computer industry in the slightest.  I;m a registerd nurses.  I run linux because it's safe, stable, and affordable (yes i paid for it, a lot less expensive the Windows).
<BR>

<BR>
I run a duel boot system.  I use Windows to play games (though less these days since Linux games run better in most cases).  I'm not a Linux nazi, I believe you should use whatever you comfortable with.  My major contention is end-user choice.  I do believe you may find somethings distasteful in the next couple of years related to Microsoft, cost, and privacy. 
<BR>
then again, maybe not.  Windows did what Bill Gates said it would.  I put a computer in every house (that's if every house buys a computer).  However, the main focus of Microsoft is to make money for shareholders, that's fine also - not a problem!  The way I see it is that with 9 out of 10 desktop computers running Windows.  The focus is on sales - not really technology (though Microsoft does a lot of development).  The focus of Linux is on Technology, and then sales.  Seriously, Linux has become quit user friendly.  The point is that like shareware vs freeware vs proprietary is what it gives the user.  I find Linux gives me what I need, doesn't crash, and hasn't trashed by a virus/worm.  Oh and linux comes with at least 4 or 5 different firewalls, And SuSE 7.2 (running the 2.4.4-4GB kernel) came with both "Antivir" and AMaVIS (A Mail Virus Scanner).  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Oh come on, kewl d00dz like YOU should be able to come up with better than THAT.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Using your logic, nobody would be able to have an opinion on anything except what they do. &lt;
<BR>

<BR>
False. There is a qualitative difference between the uniformed opinion and the expert opinion.
<BR>

<BR>
Or do you plan on having "opinions" on how the surgeon does your by-pass should that day come?
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Therefore, we would not have a right to criticize world leaders, movies, Bill Gates (are you a CEO? No I didn't think so), etc.&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
Specious. It actually would be legitimate to question my non-CEO opinion on matters which require expertise in high level business. Meaning, I don't KNOW how to be a CEO so any opinion on such from me would be uniformed and useless.
<BR>

<BR>
That doesn't mean I can't ever criticize Gates. Not everything he does is limited to the technical realm of the CEO. There are, in fact, areas in which he has "opinions" which are as uniformed as the last homeless guy you passed.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;This is the kind of world we would live in if Linux users had anything to say about it.&lt;

Shareware is software with limited functionality that you download free off the net. Linux is a program with limited functionality that you download off the net. Thus, it follows by syllogism that Linux is shareware. </i>
<BR><BR>Quick question: Are you a Microsoft Shareholder (wouldn't that suck?) or are you having sex with someone who works at Microsoft?
<BR><BR><i>Which means that you can't install it if you don't already have a computer running linux to recompile the kernel specifically for a 486. Duh. The article's complaint stands. He can't install Mandrake in a 486.</i>
<BR><BR>Well, if the author is so grossly ignorant he doesn't know that the i586 came after the i486, and that programs compiled with 586 optimizations won't run on a 486 then maybe that is his problem. God forbid he learn how to read the minimum requirements, or grab the <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3#486">486 version</a> that is plainly available. Programs compiled for i586 or better not running on a i486 is true of programs compiled with Microsoft's Visual C++ too and not just some "Linux thing."&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;
<BR><BR><i>I'm sorry, but if you expect to win over regular desktop users like me, you better speak to us in terms we can understand, not all this propellerspeak (like "paging"-- isn't that what the machine in my belt does?). </i>
<BR><BR>'Paging' is also known to you proppeller-speaking Windows users as "using Virtual Memory." When you don't have enough memory installed in your computer to run the operating system and user programs you are running some of the memory that isn't being actively used will be copied to the harddisk to make additional room for applications and user data. You know what 'applications' and 'user data' are, right? No, I didn't think so.
<BR><BR><i>Wrong. Since the most popular Lunix distro is famous for security holes (plenty of remote root attacks discovered all the time), there have been successful worms that exploit them. Since this distribution is marketed to people who don't know how to close up the system, and it installs by default all sorts of unneeded exploitable network daemons, that means that for an average windows user like me that doesn't know the meanings of terms like "remote root attack", "network worm", "distribution", "exploit", or "daemon", the virus risk from Linux is much higher than with windows.</i>
<BR><BR>There is a point and click interface to add and remove daemons that are needed or not used. During the install you are told not to run daemons you do not use. About 80 or so Windows users on the same network segment with me have their C:\ drives shared with the world c/o Windows 98's tight security. If I were so inclined I could leave notes on their desktops. Thank you Microsoft! Would you care to perhaps NAME A REMOTE ROOT HOLE? You know, or perhaps recount for me all the many virii that have hit Linux in the past 5 years. Then, you can try recounting all the Windows virii in the past 5 years but you may have FBI at your door for launching a Denial of Service attack if you list >5% of them.
<BR><BR><i>Are they point-and-click? How good of an interface? How good are the help files? Do they have wizards that guide you through choosing the right configuration? 
</i> 
<BR><BR>Yes, they are point and click. They have beautiful and fully functional interfaces. They offer from a simple wizard that a novice could use all the way up to a powerful and flexible wizard for the pros. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

The version number 8.1 has no meaning in the context of Linux, it only refers to MandrakeLinux, other distros are at different version numbers.

Perhaps you should try to get your facts right before yu criticize others

Less than 40$ for the most part.  The reason for this is that the major manufacturers agree to pick up support costs for the operating system + hardware.  When they do this, Microsoft saves a huge amount of cash on support costs and passes the savings along to the vendor. (despite charging for phone support, Microsoft does not make money on tech support.) 
<BR><BR>If the major manufacturers sold computers with Lunix preinstalled, they'd still have to pick up the tab for support, and the usability problems with Lunix would incur greater support charges than the $35 or so they pay to MS.

In my younger days, I believed that software was an art; It could be elegant and clear or it could be a clumsy hack.  Perhaps that's still true, but it doesn't affect the vast majority of computer users out there.  99% of computer users are only concerned about getting the job done.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, the battle has been raging for years over whose operating system can beat the snot out of the other operating systems.
<BR>

<BR>
Win32: I have the most market share and applications!
<BR>

<BR>
Linux: Yeah, but I don't have to reboot every hour!
<BR>

<BR>
Mac: I'm more secure and user friendly than you guys!
<BR>

<BR>
And on and on it goes.  I am a firm believer that each operating system has its strengths and weaknesses, and that there will always be zealots from the various camps.
<BR>

<BR>
Ultimately, I don't think there will ever be a unanimous consent on which is the "Best" operating system, because different people have different needs and agendas.  Choice is a good thing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I just wandered here & read a couple of stories & comments.  Adequacy indeed.  Maybe that should be changed to barelyadequate.org.  In this story alone I've read maybe one *almost* factually correct comment.  Almost nothing in the parent story is correct.  Since I'm bored, and you guys obviously need a little education, I'll correct a few items:
<BR>

<BR>
1.  The person who created the Linux kernel is Linus Torvalds, not Linux Torvalds.  Linux is the operating system, Linus is the person.
<BR>
2.  Mandrake, Red Hat, Slack Ware (slackware), Storm and Coral (Corel) are all different distributions of Linux, similar to the different types of Windows (NT, 95, 98, 2000).  They are all different, but have much in common.
<BR>
3.  Mandrake is a particular distribution tailored to Pentium computers.  Other distros are not.  I run slack happily on several 486s with 8-32mb RAM.  Each distro has it's strengths & weaknesses, and it's own target audience.  So does Windows.  95 might run on a 486, but I bet he won't run 2000 on it.
<BR>
4.  Internet Explorer is *not* a standard.  It is a proprietary piece of software written by MS.  It mostly follows the standards, which a few extensions.  All browsers extend the HTML standard, so I won't knock them too much on that.  The reason there is no Linux version is because MS doesn't want to write a compatible version.  If it were open source, someone else could port it to Linux.  (that being said, is one of the biggest arguments in favor of open source software such as Linux).  However, most distributions ship with Netscape, at least, and usually 4-10 other browsers.  http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ is the place to learn about HTML standards.
<BR>
5.  There are several Office suites available on Linux, and not a few games.  However, if you want to run mostly MS software, you should be running Windows.  And yes, currently Windows is a better gaming platform.  Not as good as a Playstation, but better than Linux.  Linux is good for a lot of things, but not everything.  As to the unreliability of the software, if he actually installed Linux, he'd find out that the free beta (testing) software is much more stable & reliable than Windows.  I reboot windows at work daily.  I reboot my Linux machines when I feel like it, some of them only get rebooted when the power goes out.
<BR>
6.  As for security, there is a good reason why there are few virus scanners for Linux (I've heard of one or two, used for mail servers that serve Windows PCs), almost all viruses run only on Windows PCs.  You *can't* get them on Linux.  And many commercial firewal products (linksys, dlink, etc) are based on a Linux core.  Just because you don't see Linux doesn't mean it's not there.  Every current Linux distribution offers firewalling, the version in Mandrake 8.1 is supposed to be one of the most user-friendly.  I don't know, I have an old 486 running a Slackware based firewall for my entire network, and it also acts as a web server, a file server, and a mail server.  It's so reliable in it's tasks that I don't even have a monitor or keyboard for it, it'll email me if it's having problems & automatically lock out any "hackers" trying to break in.  Code Red, Nimda?  Both only run on Windows servers.  They cause so many problems because most people don't even know they have it.
<BR>
7.  Windows does *not* come free with new PCs.  You pay for it in the cost of the computer.  Bill Gates did not become a billionaire by giving away his products.
<BR>

<BR>
In closing, Linux is not for everyone, but neither is Windows.  There are many instances where I would not recommend Linux, where Windows is a better choice.  Linux is making incredible progress in the arena of user friendliness, but I'll give it a year or so before I'll tell my grandmother to install it.  Still, I'll use it, and many other people will start using it when they realize how expensive it will be to run WinXP, and the fact that MS will soon after start operating on a lease basis, where you have to pay a monthly fee to use it or it stops working.

<b>It's Linus Not Linux</b><br>

It's Linus not Linux;  <br>
Linux is the kern[e]l;<br>

Linux ( the O.S. ) <br>
Was original[l]y<br>
 Called Freeix.<br>

Don't use it.    I don't like <br>
Windows but that's my opinion.<br>
And I respect your opinion <br>
Of liking Windows and <br>
I won't try to ins[u]lt<br> 
Windows, not that I couldn't.<br> 
It's just [that], if you like Windows<br>
You won't like Linux.<br>
 <br>
 'Nuf[f] said.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- --<BR><BR>
See?  Now, I know some poets these days still reject standard punctuation and capitalization, and I can respect that if you really feel more comfortable writing that way.  In this case, I showed my preference for a return to standard English.  The whole all-lowercase, no punctuation thing is just so... well, so <i>1985</i>, you know?  It's really been done so much that it hardly has the effect it once did, so why not take advantage of the contrast you get with standard English, vis a vis your radical ideas and your traditional form?  But really, that's up to you.  If you want to take out the punctuation and put it all back in lowercase, go ahead.  You'll still have a pretty good poem, either way.
<BR><BR>
Good work.  I hope to see more of your writing here!

Well, you're half right. As I've stated before they're not all GNU/Linux, but that's a technicallity. Though he's more correct in calling them distributions, because the types of windows that he mentioned <i>are</i> different versions of Windows, not different distributions.
<br><br>
<i>3. Windows 2000 is a server operating system. 486s are not server hardware. Your point is irrelevant.</i>
<br><br>
A nice thing about linux however is that the distributions that can run on older hardware can effectively make it a server. There are tons of people that are using old 486s among other types of hardware as the gateway machines on their networks, to share internet access and firewall the rest of the network. His point remains valid.
<br><br>
<i>
4. Standards are defined by marketshare. 90% of computer users use IE. Therefore, IE is the standard. You must be a netscape apologist.</i>
<br><br>
He was referring to protocol standards, determined by standards groups such as the International Organization for Standards (ISO). Any web browser can be coded to comply with these standards, therefore IE is not a standard on its own. It may be a benchmark for web browsers, but that's not the same issue.
<br><br>
<i>
5. Thank you for admitting the superiority of Windows. It helps to excuse your other fallacies.</i>
<br><br>
That's mature... Don't throw away the basket just because one egg is bad.
<br><br>
<i>
6. As someone else pointed out in another comment, viruses do exist for Linux. The reason why you haven't heard much about them can only be because Linux users and traderags that cater to Linux users don't want to burst the bubble of Linux's perceived invulnerability.
</i>
<br><br>
That person was incorrect in assuming that worms and exploits were the same as virii, and I have already replied to their post to correct this. There is no massive conspiracy in the Linux community to cover up the dangers of virii, in fact the Linux and open source community is a big opponent of security through obscurity and is generally quite open on all issues.
<br><br>
<i>7. IE is given away for free. Why would Bill Gates be giving IE away for free if he weren't already in the habit of giving his software away for free? Hmmmm? </i>
Internet Explorer was created and given away in an attempt (a successful one at that) to grab internet market share when they realized that they were being passed by in this field. Other than patches and similar small attempts to gain market share (such as windows media player), and patches, what else does he give away? His operating system? Heck no! Oh and the things that are given away, their source code isn't released to the public either.

I would agree, if it wasn't for the fact that standards also need to be maintained by a standards body with some sort of inertia so that we don't have Microsoft users complaining perpetually to computer mags about "Office 2000 doesn't play with my Office 97 files", etc ad infinitum, ad nauseam ...  Also, what is wrong with being a "netscape apologist", please tell?  If competition is part of capitalism, why do you personally have a downer on netscape, one of Microsoft's erstwhile competitors?

Market share!  Do they teach you nothing at college these days?  Market share in this case is generated by giving away the sausage and selling the sizzle.  And by making sure that Internet Explorer runs on practically every desktop, Bill Gates makes sure that Netscape won't make any money.  That's a long, long way from giving away the source code so that the product can be independently reviewed and debugged.
<BR>

In short, the review was atrocious, a joke in bad taste, and yes, if the reviewer had bothered to pay any attention, he would've noticed that Mandrake is also available for 486s.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I can't believe how wrong this article is .. calling that guy ignorant is really the most charitable thing I can say. So I'll leave it at that. However just replying to what you said:
<BR>

<BR>
1. The guy's first name is LINUS not Linux. Check it out its not a secret.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Different distributions of Linux may still have exactly the same kernel they are not different versions. Version has a very specific meaning in software development. And anyway the current Mandrake is based on the current RedHat.
<BR>

<BR>
3. I am writing this from work on my Win 2000 WORKSTATION not server. And I use it to run an xclient to the server which runs RedHat.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Standards are open. IE is usually the default browser but since IE is not open perhaps by standard you mean typical.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Windows is good for gaming. And Office is better than comparable suites on Linux ... at the moment. Linux evolves MUCH faster than Windows. 10 years ago Linux was at the level of Dos 1. 3 years ago it was at the level of Windows 3. Today I prefer it to windows.
<BR>

<BR>
6. There are FOUR known viruses for Linux, and they are rare, don't do much damage and one in fact has an anti-virus written for it. New Windows virii come out daily. Fact of life. Most people in the linux community just laugh at all the damage done by SirCam and CodeRed and Nimda. Doesn't affect us at all.
<BR>

<BR>
7. IE was given away free to destroy Netscape .. which it has succeeded in doing. Read the judgement of fact in the monopoly case against MS. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Maybe this is all still a troll ... surely people aren't that clueless ?

Close, but not quite right.  Normally I would ignore such an obvious typo, but since this article is geared towards computer "newbies" I think it is important to have all the facts correct.
<BR><BR>
The question of what is the correct name for "Linux" has been a hotly debated topic amongst its users and developers.  Fortunately, at the 2001 Linux World Convention, a name was agreed on by all participants (Including such luminaries as Linux Thorvalds, Richard Stallman, Bruce Perens, Eric Raymonds, Commander Taco, and Jack Briggs).
<BR><BR>
The correct, full name of "Linux" is in fact GUN/LINUX.  Furthermore, GUN/LINUX is now a registered trademark of Linux Thorvalds and is also an ISO and IETF standard.  Thank goodness this debate can finally end!  Now if we can just decide on the <a href="http://www.linuxfreak.org/linus.au">proper pronunciation</a>!
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
<i>NT, 95, 98, 2000 and XP are different versions of Windows. By your admission, they stand in essentially the same relation to each other as the versions of Linux listed.</i>
<BR><BR>
Those are all different versions of Microsoft Windows.  Technically, Linux is only a kernel (the liason between the application and the hardware.)  As such, you can't do much with just a kernel.  You need applications on top of it and a suitable operating environment.  Natually, there are numerous options available for the POSIX (UNIX and Linux-like) operating system.  This is what marks the difference between the different distributions (not versions) of Linux.  Mandrake has created a collection of applications and operating environments ON TOP OF the linux kernel.  They are similiar, but it would not be entirely accurate to say that Red Hat, Slackware, etc are different version of the Linux Operating System.
<BR><BR>
<i>Sorry, but just looking at the logs from the various web servers I manage contradicts this. IE *is* the standard web browser.</i>
<BR><BR>
It is true that Internet Explorer is the most popular web browser in the world.  As such, any web developer is going to make sure that his work is rendered correctly in IE.  This is not to say that IE or Microsoft defines the standards.  The standards are defined by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org">W3C</a> (World Wide Web Consortium), an international organization devoted to standardizing HTML, CSS, DOM, and every other imaginiable aspect of the Web.  So far, no browser is fully compliant with these standards.  The closest I've seen is the Gecko-based browsers (Netscape 6, Mozilla, and Galeon.)  IE6 supposedly supports both W3C standards as well as previous (non-W3C) code, and you can choose which mode to view in.
<BR><BR>
<i>No, none of the versions of Office run on Linux. This is a plain falsehood.</i>
<BR><BR>
I really don't know what you were thinking when you wrote this.  Of course Microsoft Office doesn't run on Linux (at least, when it's not emulating Windows) but to suggest that there are no alternatives is pure fallacy.  StarOffice, KOffice, and various others are all perfectly acceptable substitutes for the vast majority of MS Office functions.

"Office" is used for defining a group Office Productivity Applications NOT a Microsoft Product! And most people refer to it as "MS Office" or "Microsoft Office".

Also if I remeber correctly StarOffice (which runs on Linux & Windows amoung other platforms) was created in 1985 long before, MS Office became "Office"<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Red Hat linux is made by Red Hat, Inc. (www.redhat.com)  it is at version 7.1
<BR>

<BR>
Mandrake Linux is at very 8.1 and in made by MandrakeSoft (www.mandrake.com).
<BR>

<BR>
SlackWare Linux is at version 8.0 (i think) and was made by Walnut Creek Software, but is now made by others (www.slackware.com).
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is a *commodity* it is made by several _different_ companys (unlike windows which is made by only one). You reviewed the Mandrake _brand_ of linux.  The comparison ot XP, ME, NT is fails completely on its face since linux is an entirely different brand of best. This gives you the ability to try out different versions if you don't like the service or direction of your current distrubution.
<BR>

<BR>
There are office productivity suites availible for linux.  KOffice, OpenOffice, HancomOffice and Corel Office are all examples. A quick search on "office for linux" on google would have cleared this up.
<BR>

<BR>
Further, IE is not a standard in the IT sense of the word, while it is the most commonly used browser no standards commitee has blessed it as standard.
<BR>

<BR>
All of this information is plainly availible from non-linux sites such as C|Net, ZDNet and others.  Please if you are going to review something, please take the time to research it. Your ignorance is alarming.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

1) A review is printed thrashing linux pretty soundly based on misunderstandings and just plain wrong "facts".
<BR>

<BR>
2) A group of people point out that the article is wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
3) A small portion of the readship here jumps down their throat, and re-stating their original (and mostly wrong) facts.
<BR>

<BR>
4) THEN, the people trying to correct the article (whom you blanketly declare to be linux zealots) get rude.

all the computer animated effects in TITANIC were done in Linux.

hell, Linux can run the Windows98 desktop (OS) in
<BR>
a window and run Internet Explorer AND Office at the same time in win98 running in a linux window.
<BR>

<BR>
don't get too confused now.
<BR>

<BR>
LUCASFILM/ILM, DREAMWORKS, SONY PICTURES to name a few use LINUX, not MS products (they cannot handle the load) 
<BR>

<BR>
TiVO uses LINUX.
<BR>
THE SONY PLAYSTATION 2 uses LINUX!!
<BR>

<BR>
get the picture?
<BR>

<BR>
LINUX is versatle, portable, powerful.
<BR>

<BR>
it is used in supercomputers all the way down to embedded devices.
<BR>

<BR>
The NSA uses LINUX and contributes security patches to linux as well as having thier own Linux distribution
<BR>

<BR>
The U.S. NAVY uses LINUX. they needed somthing more secure than Windows. 
<BR>

<BR>
So before I hear anything more about how UN-AMERICAN using Linux is remember, you accuse THE U.S. Military as well as the NSA and a bunch of U.S.Corporations.  (this was for another poster)
<BR>

<BR>
and when he said Office suit he didn't mean MS Office. an Office suit is a generic term NOT owned by Microsoft. Star office is an office suit
<BR>
OPEN OFFICE is an office suit, K OFFICE is an office suit.
<BR>

<BR>
you are such an ingrained Microsoft user that you don't even know that other products exist.
<BR>

<BR>
I bet that you are one of those people who asked if thier was a linux will run in windows.

<BR><BR><i>all the rendering was done with linux in Shrek. all the computer animated effects in TITANIC were done in Linux. ANY version of windows would not be able to handle the workload.</i>
<BR><BR>Wrong.  In the case of Titanic, the reason Linux was used was not because they couldn't have done it with Windows; it was because they were overbudget by the time they had to render, and couldn't afford to pay for the Windows licenses.  If they had spent their money more wisely they would have chosen Windows.

that fact that you consider ALL cinema but european "bad" is your opinion.

&lt;cite&gt;Previous versions of Linux have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral. 
<BR>
NT, 95, 98, 2000 and XP are different versions of Windows. By your admission, they stand in essentially the same relation to each other as the versions of Linux listed. Thus, your "correction" has the exact same content as the article! &lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Windows 1.0 to WinME are successor version of a Graphics Shell (Windows) on top of a DOS kernel.  In the earlier versions, DOS was the entire kernel.  In the latest versions - Win98 onwards specifically - most of the kernel functions have been taken over after booting by the some of Windows' own code.  Windows NT to Windows XP are successors to MS OS/2, built on the same original source code.  Eg, you install Windows NT 3.51 by typing winnt in the i386 directory - you install windows 2k by typing the self-same command.  You have to make the same choices for both in identical situations if you want identical setups.  &lt;b&gt;I know this - I've done this.&lt;/b&gt;  Have you?
<BR>

<BR>
Whereas Red Hat is a distribution of Linux published by the Red Hat company.  Linux-Mandrake is a distribution of Linux published by the Linux-Mandrake company.  Corel Linux was a distribution of Linux published by the Corel company.  Debian is a distribution of Linux published by a group of individuals connected via the Internet.  I could go on ... but what's the point.  Dumber and dumber is the message I'm getting from the Microsoft Taleban on this web site.

Since you don't care to answer the points I raised about either the Windows 1.0 to WinME family or the Windows NT to Windows XP family I presume that means you haven't got all that much experience of any of those operating systems.  Let alone installing them.

MandrakeSoft is one company that makes Linux-based operating systems.  Their Linux is geared towards the newbie, and the home user.  It is a <i>flavor</i> for people just getting into it, and for people who want to do things like surf the Internet, play mp3s, play Quake, etc.  Another distribution is RedHat.  This company makes Linux geared mainly for servers, offices, business use.  They have several office suites, ftp, just about any business product that you use.  Debian is another distribution.  This one, however, is the GNU distribution.  It is geared for "true believers" and hackers (hacker in the sense of computer experts, not in the sense of breaking into other computers).  This is basically difficult to use, but makes up for it by being VERY customizable.  There are countless distros around.  I would say that RedHat is more like the Big Mac from McDonalds, Mandrake is the Whopper from Burder King, and Debian is a fancy burger from some high priced restaurant.<BR><BR>In a nutshell, distros are made by different companies, and are entirely separate from other distributions.  Distributions have their own versions.  So while Mandrake and RedHat are technically the same OS, they are produced by entirely different companies, and are in competition with each other, the same way MS Office is in competition with Corel Office.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Different companies have released different distrobutions. They have released versions of these distributions.

Windows 3.0 to 3.1 to 95 to 98  to 98B to ME to XP home edition.

Windows NT 3.5 to 4.0 to 2000 to XP professional edition.

The only difference is that microsoft has released the windows operationg systems, and other companies have released their own distributions of Linux.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Sorry, but just looking at the logs from the various web servers I manage contradicts this. IE *is* the standard web browser
<BR>
It is an ad hoc standard. Noone except Microsoft has stated that it was a full standard.
<BR>

<BR>
Unless you are a high-level executive at Microsoft, I see no reason to believe this claim from you. Perhaps Linux is not technologically advanced enough to run IE? 
<BR>
As has been stated before, unless you are a programmer, you wouldn't understand the explanation of libraries, calls, API's and compilation. The main business reason they don't is because that would be supporting their rival. If they ported IE over to linux, then they would be giving people one more reason to use linux on the desktop.
<BR>

<BR>
No, none of the versions of Office run on Linux. This is a plain falsehood. Your rhetorical bag of tricks is running empty, eh?

Office suites do not equal microsoft office. Microsoft office is an office suite, but it is not the be-all, end-all of office suites. StarOffice is an office suite that was designed for linux.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There are major differences between Red Hat, Mandrake, etc.  First of all, let me tell you that Linux is not Windows, not even close.  The Linux philosophy is ENTIRELY different from Microsoft philosophy.  You are very full of FUD.  I was once a person that spread FUD, but then I realized that I liked the Linux philosophy better.  
<BR>

<BR>
As for your first comment, you need to realize that Red Hat, Debian, SlackWare, and Mandrake are not "versions".  They are all different companies that produce their own version of Linux.  Go to www.linux-mandrake.com and www.redhat.com, and unless you are blind or utterly stupid, this will be obvious.  Mandrake has versions 6.0, 6.2, 7.0. 7.1, 7.2, 8.0, and now 8.1.  Redhat has versions running up tp 7.1  Redhat and Mandrake are similar, but they are produced by two entirely different companies.  Besides, if you want to know what version of Linux you are really using, look at the version of the Kernel.  The latest version of Linux is 2.4.10.  Mandrake, Redhat, and other distributions are suites.  They are software packages.  
<BR>

<BR>
Internet Explorer is currently the de-facto standard web browser.  And he is right.  Microsoft does NOT want to create IE for Linux.  Just in case you haven't noticed, M$ declared a holy war against Linux.  And if you doubt that Linux is advanced enough, I CHALLENGE you to try the Konqueror and Mozilla and Opera web browsers for Linux.  And also, Netscape 6.1 is available for Linux.  Linux is definitely advanced enough to run IE.  Not only that, but I can do anything on my Linux system that I can on Windows.  I can play Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, mp3s, video, you name, and I am doing it on Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
No Office?  Microsoft is NOT the Alpha and the Omega of office!  Maybe you should try Star Office 5.2.  It is available for both Windows AND Linux.  http://www.sun.com/products/staroffice/ It is a free download.  Try it!  You might be impressed!!
<BR>

<BR>
You have a lot of misinformation about Linux, and that is understandable.  Microsoft has been spreading so much false propaganda that almost every software organization has blasted them.  Yes, I am a Linux evangelist.  Do I think Linux is a better system?  Yes.  But the choice is up to you.  I do not care what OS you like.  Many people tried Linux, and decided that they wanted to stay with Windows.  But what I AM against is the spread of entirely false information, and that is what this comment is about.  So for all of you who have "preconceptions" about Linux, I CHALLENGE you to try it.  If you have about 5 GBs left on your HD, you can install Linux on it.  There are many distributions, but I would recommend Mandrake because you would be total newbies.  The OS costs only $20 when you buy it at the store.  The OS is free (as in free beer) when you download it, but I would advise against this unless you have a broadband (cable, DSL, Satellite, T1, T3) Internet connection.  You can burn the ISOs on CDs.  And best of all, you can easily have Linux and Windows on the same machine.  I run a dual boot OS.  You can have both on the same HD, or better, you can easily buy a new HD and install Linux on that.  So this is a challenge to those who hate Linux.  Give it a try.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

I'm a linux fan, and I 'waste' a lot of time learning about my computer. To me open source, means the opportunity for a greater understanding. While the code is free, it certainly costs me a great deal in time.
<BR>

<BR>
As someone else pointed out, the reason that the commercial applications the reviewer mentioned (IE, Office and some firewall package) aren't available on linux, is because their owners choose not to make them available. Apple Mac owners have struggled with the same thing.
<BR>

<BR>
I suspect we'll see most Linux users will have a moderate response to this article. Linux is out there, and for a lot of users it works just fine. If people choose not to use it, that's fine too. 
<BR>

<BR>
Yes you need a bit more knowledge to use it, because it has historically used by a market which had above average computer literacy. I personally wouldn't recommend linux for any of my friend who describe themselves as 'computer dummies'. Not yet anyway!

<BR>
Yeah, Mandrake is specifically compiled and built for Pentium class (and higher) CPU's.  It is one of the few with most others supporting the 386 and 486.
<BR>

<BR>
For the record, I have installed and run Mandrake 8.1.  I enjoy it and think it is one of the better distributions out there (just my opinion of course).
<BR>

<BR>
I enjoy looking for better ways to do things and ultimately this leads to readings some documentation.  Anybody, no matter what the chosen OS, that wants to get sthe most out of their system or take their knowledge further must ultimately read the topic in depth.
<BR>

<BR>
Just my 2 cents worth.

I would like to point out that the action in question is not hacking, nor is it breaching any sort of security, nor is it compromising any system of any kind.  Rather, it is obtaining a signature from the server.  The server is gladly providing an indication that it <b>is</b> indeed an Apache server.

However, I think it is plain to me (and to everybody else) that this action is not a precursor to an attack.  Rather it obtaining a web server signature as evidence for an argument.  I sincerely doubt that adequacy.org is going to sic their lawyers on him for obtaining something that is prominently displayed in the HTTP response.

On a side note, as an apache administrator, I know that you can even turn off the server signature if you like.  Adequacy.org chose not to do so, probably because they realize that it is a minor security hazard.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As you have said, HTTP is a protocol whose design criteria is communication between HTTP servers and clients, not between servers and nosy users.

You mean they don't?  Already?  At their stage of psychological development, anything's worth it.  Anyone can find out what sort of operating system someone's running, with a little digging.  It's not that difficult.  Most operating systems have some sort of digital signature that is in their executables.

I see.  You're an expert on security now.  You know all the holes in Linux's source code, I take it.  You know Microsoft's source code back to front and can quote me chapter and verse.  You know why a buffer overflow is dangerous and how to deal with that.  You know why an open review process might work with keeping politicians passably honest, but of course it won't work when we're dealing with software - or science of course ...

Well, it clearly states in Adequacy.org's Terms of Service:
<BR><BR>
<i>Adequacy.org gives permission for its servers to be accessed by any program specifically designed to be a legitimate HTTP client, by mail transport agents legitimately transporting email relevant to the site. Any other means of accessing Adequacy.org, including, but not limited to, telnet access to any port, port scans, and such, are not allowed, and constitute unauthorized access (a.k.a. "hacking").</i>
<BR><BR>
I think it's pretty clear that using telnet to get the HTTP header violates this agreement.
<BR><BR>
Wait a minute, did I say agreement?  I didn't agree to anything.  Lemme take a look here...*Scrolls through front page, article page, etc.*  I don't see anything in here saying anything about Terms of Service.  How am I supposed to abide by it if I can't even find it? Usually there's some very fine print at the bottom saying something like "By accessing this site, you agree to our <a href="../../special/tos.html">Terms of Service</a>"

<BR><BR>Interesting. Care to give a legally enforceable definition of a legitimate HTTP client?

If displaying ads is so important to the livelihood of this website, it's administrators should look into text based ads.<br>

What you are all are failing to realize is that Telnet, SSH, lynx, box cutters, etc. are all tools that can be used for legitimate as well as illigitimate uses.  Even your beloved IE can be used to exploit back doors installed on computers by the Code Red II virus.  I'll patiently wait for a reply saying that all the tools listed should be illegalized.<br>

This republic we live in (And to the Republic for which it stands. (note does not say Democracy)) was based on freedoms. As a soldier that premise is all that matters. Based on that I would like to  know what Capitalisim has to do with anything.  I do not understand how attempting to give the people the freedom of manipulating a piece of software to conform it to standards they may specifically require undermines the basis of the Constitution.  It is all about freedom.  Capitalism has nothing to do with what I as a soldier stood (and stand) for with the possible exception that you should have the freedom to be part of it if you choose to do so.  I personally believe that capitalisim is nothing more than the greed of others using what ever it is that they may have at their disposal taking away the rights of others to further their own gains.
<BR>

<BR>
Now at what point do you percieve the removal of rights to be furthering your freedoms.  I do not see any accuracy to your statement.  To say that undermining capitalisim is stomping on a Vet or Fireman is truely ignorant.  The soldier is there to preserve your freedom not to find new ways to remove it. Capitalism has nothing to do with freedom and it damn well had nothing to do with the reasons for founding this great country we live in.
<BR>

<BR>
P.S. I also find Linux to be the better and more stable OS but as a soldier I give you the freedom to choose if it or something else is best for you. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>For one, it needs to be known that people do not use Lynx exclusively to skip banner ads. People typically use Lynx whenever other alternatives are not available. <b>THIS CAN BE THE CASE, AND STILL IS FOR MANY PEOPLE</b>. And telling them to "go upgrade" is not always an option; in the case of one couple I know who has to use a 'shell account' (a 'net connection of a type that limits you to Lynx and similar text-only browsers), no other internet services are offered that are available to them.

<BR><BR>For my other point... capitalisim fetishists always hate me for pointing this next bit out, but <b>America was not founded on Capitalism</b>. The Founding Fathers, for the most part, were people with heavy backgrounds in scientific thought (not just Benjamin Franklin; many of them were) and advocates of learning and public sharing of information. Pure capitalism tends to induce eventual totalitarian domination over those under same, and the Founding Fathers did not want that - they were trying to get OUT from such a system and PREVENT one from happening again. Encouraging thoughts similar to Capitalism and other means of driving the individual to excel is just a means of keeping the populace educated so they can make smart decisions when it comes to participating in their government, nothing more. (Disclaimer: I am not a socialist. I am not a Marxist-Leninist. I am not a capitalist. I am not anything resembling any of these. I do not subscribe to any 'pure' economic theory, because no economic theory has ever survived contact with the market.)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Obviously you take the register seriously, since you offer it as a source of information. The only people who consider the register a useful source of information are those who share the same bias as the registers "journalists".

For instance a worm written for Solaris 8 on Sparc is not even going to bother systems running Linux on Sparcs, Solaris on i386's, or Win 2K on i386 except for maybe taking up bandwidth.
<BR>

<BR>
The Morris worm only affected DEC's VAX and Sun Microsystems's Sun 3 systems. The bad thing was though in 1988 VAX's and Sun 3's made up almost the entire internet so it pretty much took the internet out.  
<BR>

<BR>
If "Wintel" achieve their goal of everyone running some kind of Windows on some kind of i386, the internet is doomed. There has to be some varity or one worm could take everything out.

Your little communist free software fantasy world is about to fall apart, by the way. I took a look at netcraft, and it seems that IIS just took a huge bite out of apache's market share.

<BR><BR>
To suggest that obtaining an HTTP server signature is of the same degree as breaking a cryptographic scheme to expose copyrighted material is completely inaccurate.  Under the DMCA, it is illegal to circumvent copy-protection of copyrighted material.  That's a far cry from looking at the server's signature.
<BR><BR>
<i>What matters is the damage wreaked upon the victim by the transgressor's plainly illegal acts.</i>

Damage?  What damage?  That signature is spewed out thousands of times an hour.  No damage is being done, the server's doing what it should.

If people like you were in charge, "legal" Web use would proabably be with IE and Communicatior, while all other use (uh, last I checked, Konqueror wasn't IE || Communicator, nor are any proxy servers) would be considered "hacking," which, soon, in the U.S., will be punishable with a lifetime jail sentence.

He was not stealing information. He was simply looking at what the HTTP transaction was. (sorry if this is too technical for you) This is actually the same thing you would do if you would enter http://www.adequacy.org in your web browser.

A decent webmail system?  The Tulane University IT dept (of which it receives $13M annually) uses telnet and SSH (an encrypted version of telnet) to access their servers.  Not only the sysadmins, but the students (undergrad and grad) regularly log in via these tools to accomplish their tasks, including using shell email clients.  Last time I checked, Tulane University was ranked in the top 50 National Universities in America.  Hardly a skinflint regional degree mill. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Pure speculation, which is completely unfounded.  Get some facts.

<BR><BR>
Tulane is not a place, it's a school, founded in 1834 in New Orleans, LA.  It's the second-higest ranked Medical school in the South.  Just because you haven't heard of it doesn't mean it's worthless.

<BR><BR>
Once again, speculation.  And once again, unfounded.  I might also point out that a talented hacker can break into a system on a dial-up from a pay phone.  The only reason I can think of that you would need significant bandwidth would be for a DOS attack.
<BR><BR>
<i>I'm sure most of the undergraduates, and all of the post-graduates, would prefer a clean, usable email interface, such as that found at hotmail.</i>
<BR><BR>
Many of the non-CS students do use a <a href="http://webmail.tulane.edu">web-based email system</a> (as well as POP3) but the CS students find it more convenient to use the shell with its added functionality and security than a web-based email exchange.

This proves that even a school as backward and ignorant as Harvard uses Unix systems and allows people to hack, sorry telnet, their email.

More laughter.  I would hardly call hotmail a clean and usable e-mail interface.  I have used several internet e-mail services, of which I have found hotmail to be the most annoying and perturbing.  I admit to liking clean interfaces, but I'd wouldn't decry people who use telnet to check their mail.  Nor would I seriously call it a "hacker tool" since its main purposes are not for hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
This whole conversation is very funny while somewhat disheartening.  The great lack of education I see here is astounding, and saddens me greatly.  Apparently we need a lot more computer education in our newspapers and our school systems right now, since so many people have muddled ideas about hackers and about internet tools and about Linux.  Sigh.
<BR>

<BR>
Heh, and I'll probably get flamed.  Hooray for me!  I've never "hacked" a machine in my life, nor do I intend to.  I just wish that people would become more educated about what they speak about before they spend pages ranting.

The statement was "All hacking tools communicate over the internet".
<BR>

<BR>
NOT
<BR>

<BR>
"All hacking tools that enable you to access a system communicate over the internet".
<BR>

<BR>
Let's build a logical chain here...
<BR>

<BR>
1) vi can be used maliciously by hackers. It is thus a "hacking tool". 
<BR>

<BR>
2) It does not use the internet. Thus it is a hacking tool that does not communicate over the internet. 
<BR>

<BR>
3) Thus the initial statement ("All hacker tools communicate over the internet") was proven incorrect.
<BR>

<BR>
Despite your seeming inability to discern sarcasm, the logic is still impeccable.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Where have I said that vi can be used to "break into" somebody's computer? I haven't. What I have said - more than once, yet still you seem unable to comprehend - is that once you have accessed the system vi can then be used to alter vital configuration files. These files, once altered, can then be used to subvert the normal functionality of the computer.
<BR>

<BR>
In other words, vi can be used as a "hackers tool". Refer to my previous article regarding the logic chain to demonstrate that "every hackers tool communicates over the internet" is patently false.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and since I'm an Oracle dba let me give you an example using a config file I'm particularly familiar with: If I can gain access to an oracle account and vi I can do PLENTY of unpleasant stuff to the init.ora of a database. Including placing events in there that can dump EVERY sql statement going through that database. Said sql statement MIGHT include credit card or user details...
<BR>

<BR>
 (and if the database uses cold backups, I don't even need access to server manager or sqlplus... I can just wait for the next backup for the init changes to take effect)
<BR>

<BR>
Just a couple of questions:
<BR>

<BR>
1) Have you figured out yet that I'm being sarcastic?
<BR>

<BR>
and 
<BR>

<BR>
2) Have you figured out that a TEXT EDITOR can be extremely useful to a hacker once he's gained access to an account on a remote computer? If not, read the following:
<BR>

<BR>
a) Use telnet, or ssh, or some other remote access tool to access an account on a remote computer.
<BR>

<BR>
b) Use VI over the previously established connection to edit whatever the hell you like, bubba. Since vi is running locally on the remote machine it is NOT running "over the internet", but it's still being used to hack a config file to disasterous effect.
<BR>

<BR>
There, has that explained things to you yet? <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Oh, and from <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/jargon.html#hacker">The New Hacker's Dictionary</a>:
<BR><BR><b>hacker n. </b>
<BR><BR>[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. A person capable of appreciating hack value. 4. A person who is good at programming quickly. 5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term for this sense is cracker. 
<BR><BR>Also, from <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com:</a>
<BR><BR><b>hacker (hkr) n. Informal</b><br> 
One who is proficient at using or programming a computer; a computer buff.<br> 
One who uses programming skills to gain illegal access to a computer network or <b>file</b>.<br> 
One who enthusiastically pursues a game or sport: a weekend tennis hacker.<BR><BR>And more from dictionary.com....
<BR><BR><b>hack (hk)</b>
v. hacked, hack�ing, hacks v. tr.<br>
To cut or chop with repeated and irregular blows: hacked down the saplings.<br>
To break up the surface of (soil).<br> 
Informal. To <b>alter (a computer program): hacked her text editor to read HTML</b></br> 
To gain access to (a computer <b>file</b> or network) illegally or without authorization: hacked the firm's personnel database.<br> 
Slang. To cut or mutilate as if by hacking: hacked millions off the budget.<br> 
Slang. To cope with successfully; manage: couldn't hack a second job. 
<BR><BR>Hey, look, looks like your definition isn't enough. Hmmm.... now, what could be used to access a computer file illegally? Hey, <b>vi</b> could do that! It's a hacker tool after all!<b>(yet more sarcasm)</b>

Don't make unfounded accusations, do you know where telnet comes from?  No, not from any hacker site, not from any secret file server for the elite, it is a basic program that comes with windows install.  It's uses are wide and varied, and less than 1% of this list of uses is for hacking.  Telnet can be used to remote control quake servers, cable companies use it to reset and adjust routers on their networks like road runner, admins use it to reboot servers, http consoles can be brought back online.  Telnet was developed, and then later foillowed a messenger service, running by default on windows nt/2k/xp.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't like the fact that it is used for hacking 1/100 times, deal with it.  As for the person who posted that he stole information by getting the certificate, no he didn't.  He simply viewed what is sent to EACH and EVERY person who uses this server, yes, that includes you who are reading this, just go to view source in your web browser.  He "stole" nothing, if you think he did, every poster and reader here is responsible for the same, and no one can even look at a singel page on this server without stealing somthing.
<BR>

<BR>
The kinds of hacker attacks today are mainly denila of service, which would bring this site down before you could type blah and hit post.  They can use fat internet pipes and f5 networks with multiple ip's across the net, and cause a server to overload by simply feeding it too much to handle....and it doesn't take a certificate.
<BR>

<BR>
For those of you who think that he was really trying to hack the website, any kid with copy paste can show you that, because every connection to this server makes it.  As for hackers, DOS attacks and simply shutting the server down are not that hard with apache 1.30.  It seems that most of the people posting here do not know what they are talking about, or breaking into servers.  It is in this sites best intrest to close this topic.  This is the kind of topic that attracts real hackers, a challenge to one or many of us is not something a site admin should make.

<BR>
&gt;&gt; countries, precisely because people like you
<BR>
&gt;&gt; do not have the developed moral sense not to
<BR>
&gt;&gt; use it. In America, the DMCA explicitly 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; prohibits the use of circumvention devices, 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; such as telnet. Whether or not the act of 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; circumvention was easy or difficult does not 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; enter into it. If you leave your car unlocked, 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; with the keys in the ignition, that does not 
<BR>
&gt;&gt; give me the right to steal it, d0000d. 
<BR>

<BR>
Telnet is not a hacker tool.  It is used to
<BR>
remotely access a computer from another computer
<BR>
or terminal.  (eg. Your lab has a mainframe and
<BR>
several terminals and you access your account
<BR>
on the mainframe from your terminal using telnet).
<BR>

<BR>
I seriously doubt that telnet has been banned
<BR>
anywhere.  Microsoft windows comes with telnet.
<BR>
Just go to your windows directory in a dos box
<BR>
and type "telnet" if you don't believe me.  In
<BR>
fact windows comes with all the standard
<BR>
networking tools; telnet, ftp, ping, route,
<BR>
tracert, netstat, and arp.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt; You seem to think that actions you take on
<BR>
&gt;&gt; your computer do not affect the outside world.
<BR>
&gt;&gt; Stealing information via computer is just the
<BR>
&gt;&gt; same as stealing in real life. You should have
<BR>
&gt;&gt; thought before doing this, d0000000000d.
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry, I think I missed something here...what
<BR>
information was stolen again?
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, telnet was being used long before the
<BR>
world wide web ever existed on the internet.

There are two problems with your argument:
<BR><BR>
1) It was <b>NOT</b> and attempt to crash the server by sending an illegal command; it was a (successful) attempt to find out what server Adequacy.org was running.  Why?  So he could make a point, not to attack the server.
<BR><BR>
2) The W3C <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2616.txt">specification</a>  on HTTP/1.1 clearly states that in the event of an unknown request by the client, an Error 400 shall be returned.  Apache conforms to this specification by generating an error page.
<BR><BR>
Additionally, if security is such an issue, I would like to point out that the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/core.html#serversignature">ServerSignature</a> variable is easily modifiable and you can turn it off.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you check the server logs, you will see that every connection from Internet Explorer sends that request.  Without that form, the web server will not respond.  That is the initiator of the HTTP protocol.

And you know what you are talking about.  I hope.
<BR>

<BR>
That must be why your reviewer couldn't get Linux to install - though he was presumably using Win95 to write his article.  The which program having telnet installed by default.
<BR>

<BR>
The problem is that anyone who knows anything about computers knows about telnet and the &lt;ul&gt;V&lt;/ul&gt;iew Sour&lt;ul&gt;c&lt;/ul&gt;e command in Internet Explorer.  They even know about the fact that using telnet exposes you to losing your security because telnet doesn't encrypt anything it sends over the Internet.  Unlike SSH and OpenSSH which encrypt it for you.
<BR>

<BR>
Now which would you prefer to have - knowledge about vulnerabilities that could hurt you, or to remain blissfully ignorant?  Didn't Jefferson say the price of liberty is eternal vigilance?  And you're decrying it!

There are so many mistakes in it, that it actually caused me physical pain to read through it.  I'm going to take a minute to point out mistakes I caught in one read of the article.<br>

<blockquote>
...a Finnish student coincidentally named Linux Torvalds.
</blockquote>
His name is Linus, not Linux.<br>

<blockquote>
...including BSD which is based on Sun's server-grade Solaris operating system...
</blockquote>
This is backwards.  BSD was developed years before Solaris was made.  Just take a look at <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/history/unix.htm">this</a> for an outline of the history of Unix and it's variants.<br>

<blockquote>
Previous versions of Linux have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral.
</blockquote>
You are listing other distributions  of Linux.  The first two are still under active developement and should not be referred to as "previous versions" when compared to Mandrake.<br>

<blockquote>
Linux is shareware...
</blockquote>
Wrong again.  Linux is not <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=shareware">shareware</a>.  It's is software copyrighted with the GPL, which allows for free distribution and gaurantees the right to modify it as you see fit.  Notice I said "allows for free distribution", which leads to the next mistake...<br>

<blockquote>
...self-styled anti-capitalist hackers.
</blockquote>
If you had just said this without making it a link to the FSF home page, I wouldn't have had any qualms.  I can't argue that there aren't supporters of Linux who happen to be anti-capatalist.  I can argue, however, that the FSF <a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/selling.html">is not part of that group</a>.  As that page clearly explains, they have absolutely no problem with making money via open source software.<br>

<blockquote>
Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95, it seems that Linux requires far more powerful, and more expensive, computer hardware.
</blockquote>
Once again, you failed to research your topic and limited yourself to only one distribution of Linux.  There are many distributions of Linux, including Mandrake, Debian, Redhat, Slackware, etc.  Each distribution is made by a different group of people, with each group making different design decisions.  Mandrake happened to compile their distribution for Pentium and above processors becuase it provides a slight performance gain.  Mandrake, however, does not represent Linux as a whole.  There distributions which are compiled so that you can use it on a 386, 486, IA-64, Power PC, Alpha and more.  Just from that list alone, it's obvious that Linux provides a lot more flexibility than Windows ever has.<br>

<blockquote>
...why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?
</blockquote>
Because it is owned and developed by Microsoft.  If Microsoft does not port it to Linux, it is not the fault of Linux developers.  The fact that you even posed this question proves beyond a doubt that you know next to nothing about software developement.  You complain that Linux does not adhere to open standards!  This has got to be a joke.  Linux is nothing but open.  Head over to <a href="www.kernel.org">kernel.org</a> and help yourself to the Linux kernel.  For free, you are able to peruse the heart of this operating system and you can use it however you like (as long as you don't deny that right to others).  What more can you ask for?<br>
<br>
You go on to list other proprietary software that doesn't run in Linux with the same exasperation.  Once again, I point out to you that that software is owned and developed solely by their respective companies.  If the companies do not decide to support Linux, the companies are at fault.<br>

<blockquote>
To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Linux, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet.
</blockquote>
You prove once again that you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  Firewall capabilities are built into Linux at the kernel level.  That means, no matter what distribution you decide on, you will be able to filter network access in and out of your computer to your hearts content.  And there are frontends to the filtering system that allow you to setup a firewall with the braindead ease you seem to require.<br>

<blockquote>
Without even installing Linux Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws.
</blockquote>
Thank you for putting the final nail into your own coffin.  You freely admit that you never even tried out the software you are supposedly "reviewing".  I couldn't imagine holding myself to such low standards, and it makes me shudder that you do.  Especially while trying to inform people about something you are so blatently ignorant of.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this article is way off base.  I'm not arguing that Linux is taking over or that Microsoft is controlled by Satan or anything of that sort.  The only thing I wanted to say was that this article is wrong.  Obviously so.  Painfully so.<br>
<br>
In the computing world today, Linux fills a small niche.  I don't even use it exclusively.  I use it as router and server on my home network.  On my desktop computer I use Windows 2000.  Both OS'es fulfill the role I assign to them.  If you don't want to take the time to become familiar with Linux, that's fine.  Just please don't stand up on a pedestal and denounce something which you know nothing about.<br>
<br>
If any of you would like to know more about the Linux operating system, I would highly recommend that you find a credible source of information on the topic.  Feel free to email me if you would like to find out a bit more.<br>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'll refrain from making use of exaggeration again (the "actual physical pain" bit was the only time I used it in the original post.  I was completely serious about everything else.)  Also, I'll get my medical advice elsewhere, but thanks for the recommendation.<br>
<br>
Regarding the FSF, let me first say that I am in no way an official representative of them or their ideas.  However, using the information presented on the page and expanding upon your analogy, I will try to clear this up.<br>
<br>
The FSF is calling for developers to free their software in the sense that users of the software are given maximum flexibility in how they use it.<br>
<br>
They want people (users) to be free to swim.  They are definitely not asking to outlaw swimming pools (software).  The FSF fully supports owners of swimming pools providing and charging for access to the pool (This is where capatilism is kept intact, which directly contradicts the anti-capatalist reference made in the original article).<br>
<br>
The request that the FSF makes is that the swimming pool owner should not keep secret how they run the pool.  The swimmers should be kept aware about when it's open, when a lifeguard is on duty, that the pool is properly treated with chlorine, etc. etc. (This is the equivalent to the source of the software).<br>
<br>
Please remember, this is only an analogy.  I only used it becuase you introduced it and it also happened to explain the situation pretty well after thinking about it.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to use "rhetorical tricks" to avoid arguments.  I seriously thought the above was  readily apparent from the web page I linked to.<br>
<br>
Regardless of the FSF point, my original posts main point still stands.  The "review" that was posted to this site was horrible.  The reviewer had no idea what he was talking about and even admitted so himself when he stated he never installed the software in the first place.  Once again, if anybody takes that review seriously, I'm sorry for them becuase they have been grossly misinformed.<br>
<br>
One last point, don't resort to calling me an open source fanatic.  That's what most posters on here seem to be doing with everybody who is criticizing this article.  When I first started reading this article I expected it to be a negative review.  I didn't, however, expect it to be so obviously inaccurate.  That's why I made that post in the first place, becuase the article is just <b>wrong</b>.<br>

 If you thought it was a negative view without him installing, then you would've just loathed the review if he installed it. I sadly did, and it turns out that the new version of Linux is as buggy as Netscape 6. It even messed up partitions beyond my F drive!

You say that they are inherently against capatalism because the GPL insures freedom of use and distribution.  Wrong again.  There are <a href="http://www.redhat.com">companies</a> that distribute free software, it just involves a different business model.  The said company is supported by the FSF.  The FSF supports capatilism, they're just calling for software developers to implement a different business model.  Therefore, <b>your second and third sentences are wrong</b>.<br>
<br>
You then go on to say I would have loathed the review had he actually isntalled the software.  That isn't the case.  I was expecting a negative review.  I openly admit, <b>Linux is not ready for the average consumer's desktop</b>.  I wasn't expecting a completely misinformed mess posing as a review.  Had the reviewer actually taken the time to get his facts straight, I would have enjoyed the review.  So, <b>your third sentence is also wrong</b>.<br>
<br>
The last bit I cannot contest.  You're actually sticking to something you know about, your experiences with Linux.  It's true, if you don't install the OS correctly, you do risk corrupting your partitions.  I'm sorry that happened to you.  If you ever decide to try installing another OS again, I recommend you read all the pertinent documenation.  There are numerous resources for help on getting partitions setup correctly for a Linux install.<br>

I read that article in total shock and amazement.
<BR>

<BR>
I happen to use both linux AND Windows, side by side, daily. Both have their ups and downs...as a professional systems administrator AND systems programmer, I've written software for both systems, and in fact, have written software that's capable of running on BOTH platforms unmodified (thanks to the good offices of such multi-platform languages as perl, PHP, Java, Ruby, Python, and Gnu C/C++ (most of which happen to be open-source)). I have to say, that as a PROFESSIONAL programmer (11+ years of experience at that) that the above article was one that revealed a complete and total lack of research, and an absolute deficit of any knowledge whatsoever concerning how software is produced. 
<BR>

<BR>
I find it interesting that a person would say "But it doesn't run IE!". Sure it doesn't. Microsoft would rather commit ritual suicide than produce a version of IE to run on Linux...and there are some very good TECHNICAL reasons why IE won't be seen on linux as well. I could explain all about API differences, libraries, etc, but I would be wasting my time. Instead, I might point out that the humble reviewer, instead of crowing about his "bug finding prowess", might INSTEAD consider the very simple fact that he's completely ignorant of his subject.

I'm not really sure what standard I would apply to claim that "dufus" is not the correct spelling.  While neither my unabridged Webster's, nor my <i>Oxford Dictionary of Slang</i> list the word at all, the aforementioned <i>Dictionary of American Slang</i> offers both spellings, as well as "duffus."  While my source insists that the word is <i>not</i> of Yiddish origin, it can only offer comparisons with "goofus" and "doof" (Scot.) for clues to this interesting word's history.
<BR><BR>
So.  What can you do?  If you think "dufus" feels more right to you than "doofus", then "dufus" it is!  Or why not try "duffus" for a while and see if that suits you better?

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">OK, overall, I appreciate the detail into which your article delves.  But I have to take issue with some of the facts as you present them.
<BR><BR>
<i>While there
are many other alternatives to Windows, including BSD which is based on Sun's server-grade Solaris operating system,
none have commanded the same level of media attention as Linux.</i>
<BR><BR>
This is plainly wrong, as anyone worth their salt in systems administration (such as me, as I have an MCSE) knows that BSD is descended from SunOS, which is Sun Microsystem's standard operating system on their mid to high-range servers currently.  Obviously, with an operating system this powerful out on the web, Linux won't be able to compete for long.
<BR><BR>
<i>Before installing new software, it is always advisable to read the documentation.</i>
<BR><BR>
This in and of itself ought to be a black mark against Linux.  After all, how many Windows computers do you see with a manual?  None, because it doesn't need to come with one.  When you can say the same of a Linux distro, come back and tell me all about it. 
<BR><BR>
<i> After all,  
Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need  
to replace it, particularly not with a product of inferior quality.</i>
<BR><BR>
If that's true, then how come there are a bunch of computers out there with MacOS installed?  Why would they remove Windows, anyway?  Perhaps you should re-examine the facts before you write your next story.

Actually, the BSDs are based off the original UNIX which the University of California at Berkely were the first to play with the original UNIX code.  The BSDs were actually based on Unix 4.4

&lt;&lt;Linux Mandrake is just the latest in a long line of quirkily christened versions of Linux.  Previous versions of Linux have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral. In stark contrast to the mundane names such as 98, ME or NT preferred by Microsoft, the crazy names of each Linux release hint at its renegade nature.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Previous!?!  What the hell do you mean PREVIOUS!?!  These are names of CURRENT distributions.
<BR>

<BR>
Distribution     Company
<BR>
---------------------------
<BR>
Mandrake Linux   MacMillan
<BR>
Red Hat Linux    Red Hat
<BR>
OpenLinux        Caldera
<BR>

<BR>
Also, Red Hat 7.2 will be more highly welcomed because Red Hat is a multi-BILLION dollar company that has done much for the advancement of Linux.  It's also the most popular distro.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;The free availability of Linux is a major reason for its popularity among cash-strapped students and self-styled anti-capitalist hackers.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
So I guess that means the guys at Industrial Light and Magic and Pixar are all college students and anti-capitalist hackers?  They run Linux on the graphic rendering servers.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on Pentium processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old Gateway 486 were dashed. Furthermore, a whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Linux!&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you should have downloaded the right ISOs then shouldn't you have?
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Kinda like how you can't take programs from any other OS and run them on Windows?  Why don't you try running some Mac software under Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;Although a wide range of software is freely available for Linux, these pitiful offerings are mostly unfinished, unreliable and do not bear comparison to their commercial counterparts.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Obviously you have never read the halloween documents where MS stated that Open Source Software and Linux software were just as good if not BETTER than their stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
Note:  MS confessed to the authenticity of these documents.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;The shortcomings of Linux are obvious. Without even installing Linux Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws. Surely it is not too much to expect that, after ten years of development, the creators of Linux would have addressed these problems? The real question that the prospective Linux user must ask himself is, "Why bother?" After all, Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need to replace it, particularly not with a product of inferior quality.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
First off Windows took much longer than 10 years.  Microsoft was WELL funded by many other companies from BASIC (Altair) to DOS (which was just a recoded QDOS which was a sloppily backwards engineered version of CP/M-86) to Windows NT (which "borrows" much of its code from OS/2) all the way to XP which uses the NT kernel.
<BR>

<BR>
Second I point you back to the halloween docs.
<BR>

<BR>
Third, Linux was started by one man back in 1991 with version 0.01 and didn't become 1.0 until awhile later.  Linux is a kernel.  Using to make a OS didn't come until later still.  And for a kernel that's now only at version 2.4.10 (DO NOT confuse this with 8.1 or 7.2) the Linux kernel hasn't done too damn bad.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"
<BR>

<BR>
Windows, the operating SHELL was first developed by Microsoft in the middle of 84. the first real full release of Windows (windows 3.0) was in 85,86 or around there. Note that this is still a shell. it REQUIRES DOS to start and operate within (Exactly how X is on Linux/Unix).
<BR>

<BR>
Now, the first Windows Operating system was WIndows 95. which came out in what, 96 ?
<BR>

<BR>
second. DOS was not recoded QDOS which was a backwards engineered CPM/-86 or whatever. Marketing genius bill gates sold(licensed) IBM an operating system for their new computer (The PS/2) for 50,000$. the problem was that the only thing they had was a friend who was hacking his own operating system in seattle. it was NOT a hacked/backwards engineered port of CPM. it was a from scratch Command Line OS. Gates bought the source from the guy outright for 50k.
<BR>

<BR>
and DOS was born.
<BR>

<BR>
third, Altair, or ANY OTHER company has EVER given funds to Microsoft. BASIC is a programming language that Bill Gates and Paul Allen coded for the Altair Personal Computer  (which was sold as a project kit in an electronics cataloge that i used to subscribe to).
<BR>

<BR>
Alllllllllllllllll of microsofts money is from either selling stock or selling software. they have no accounts payable, they have no money that is owed to people. they have no debts.
<BR>

<BR>
fourth. IBM and Microsoft teamed up together for about 3 years and worked on a project called, OS/2. They both wanted different directions so they abondoned the project, but both kept the source code to OS/2. IBM developed it its own way, and Microsoft theres. there are very few things different, other than NT 3.5 was marketed better than IBM did with OS/2, and the GUI interface.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
The Windows XP operating system is the first REAL, TRUE 32-bit Home multimedia enhanced operating system from Microsoft.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows 95,98,98se, ME where all built around the  old 16 bit DOS kernel. This is to maintain compatibility with ANY old hardware/software.
<BR>

<BR>
Them throwing the 16 bit layer out breaks any of those old apps in windows 2000/XP, but i think no one cares one they  realize how much stabiler/faster true,full 32bit kernels are.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
oh ya, Redhat is NOT a multi-billion dollar company. they barely turned a measly 600k profit after 5 full years in business. 
<BR>
if you look at their stock (http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=RHAT&d=t), you'll see that they're only worth about 3.50 a share (10/2/2001)
<BR>

<BR>
major money there. :)

Go take a nap. Microsoft doesn't care about hardware issues.  Windows9x kernel was coded by a completely different set of people, built around Multi-Media.. While it is true that Windows9x kernel had good support for old hardware, stating that it's only purpose of being 16 bit because of the hardware is just plain foolish.

According to ComputerJobs.com's 2000 <a href="http://www.computerjobs.com/salary2000/index.asp?display=certification&emptype=perm">Salary Survey</a>, MCSEs make the least full-time salary at $42K / yr.  On Monster.com's <a href=""http://technology.monster.com/articles/salaryguide/">Tech Salary Guide</a> a UNIX administrator makes almost $62K / yr.

If you read the latest <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">Netcraft Survey</a> you would see that Microsoft, while having a significant majority of physical computers running web servers, still lags far behind Apache in the number of domains.  It is also interesting to note that the Gartner Group released an <a href=""http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=101034">Advisory</a> warning against using IIS for security reasons.
<BR><BR>
<i>This MCSE bashing is part of the Unix 'I'm so fucking 133t' that caused businesses to reject it in the first place.</i>
<BR><BR>
On the contrary, business already use UNIX in a wide variety of <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2797645,00.html">mission-critical applications</a>.  Chances are, your ISP uses a some flavor of UNIX.  Sun Solaris is still used by a large number of businesses for their computing needs.

<i>Microsoft OWNS you.</i>

Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that Microsoft owns you, Mr MCSE.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Let me see if I can't dissect this little treatise one mindless comment at a time
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;Why are you all so jealous of MCSEs?&gt;
<BR>
Uhhh....if I wanted an MCSE I would have majored in CIS and not Computer Science. But I guess someone has to dig the digital ditches.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;Could it be because we make more $$$s than you ?&gt;
<BR>
Heh, not likeley. Ditch digging only feels like it pays more because everyone else feels pretty bad for you, average starting pay for a perl coder in the right environment is usually about 60,000 to start.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;This MCSE bashing is part of the Unix 'I'm so fucking 133t' that caused businesses to reject it in the first place.&gt;
<BR>
Hehe, you don't read the news do ya?  I just delivered a full featured cXML business system written in perl on Linux that cost 1/5th the amount of a commercial solution, I got paid twice as much and still came in under that figure, its 10 times faster than Trading Networks, and if they don't like me, they can hire someone else to work on the codebase.  I don't know any business that would pass that up given the present state of the economy.  Businesses only rejeced the *NIX solutions because they needed a multi-thousand dollar server to run the OS on.  The cxml system I wrote operates at full speed on a P-133.  And yes, we are so fucking 133t.
<BR>

<BR>
I've loved watching the tech economy fall from all angles.  Almost every single MCSE I know is scrambling to find another job right now, but I and all of my Open-Source friends have more work than we can shake a stick at.  Know why?  Because we don't tie the client down to anything.  Because I don't have to preface what I sell with:"well this will work if we buy this $10,000 package from MicroSoft first".

Ever try building a cross platform gui app with it? Not just a wizard or applet but a real app? I think you'll find that swing is a dog and it's API isn't that great.

Now, perl may not be the fastest thing on the planet, it's interpreted after all, but it talks to almost every database and api around. It has it's place after all; and the performance and memory savings are largely in the coding. I've seen java programs that were slower and more memory intensive than their perl counterparts and vice versa.

Unix has been around long before Bill Gates ever had his first ejaculation...alright. Maybe not quite that long. But a long time. It is a far superior OS. It is legendary in statute that has been trusted by many for a long time. I have used EVERY MS based OS that has come out since 1985...with the exception of Windows XP, which I will NOT bother with. NONE compares with the sheer power of Unix/Linux based OSs. NONE.

The author of this article is more than entitled to his views. But it certainly would be nice to have somebody cover this subject that had a remote clue of what he was talking about (which this person clearly does not). Fact of the matter is, MS wants very much to obtain the share of the mission critical market, and what I find delight in is the fact that XP will again fail to accomplish this goal. So sorry little MSCEs. You will never know the true fruit of true mission critical applications. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Microsoft never pushed XENIX because the company didn't want to "build a long-term strategy around an operating system they'd have to pay royalties to AT&T for" (<a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=561154&lastnode_id=46100">source</a>). XENIX is still around; it's changed hands and names several times, from "XENIX" to "SCO UnixWare" and now <a href="http://www.caldera.com/images/openunix/open_unix_home.gif">Open UNIX&reg; 8</a>. Caldera positions Open UNIX 8 as a server OS that can also run Linux binaries.

<BR>
Good evening
<BR>
 
<BR>
 I'll make a few comments on your review at:
<BR>
 
<BR>
    'http://www.adequacy.org/?op=displaystory;sid=2001/9/30/83943/2736'
<BR>
 
<BR>
 I'm sure you know by now that you've got the wrong end of the stick.
<BR>
 But I'll go through the article and see if I can provide the
<BR>
 perspective that might be missing. I don't have an axe to grind - I
<BR>
 don't use mandrake and won't use mandrake, since I'm not interested in
<BR>
 that kind of frilly stuff, but I may be able to point out what it is
<BR>
 you've figured wrong. The article is really quite funny, by the way!
<BR>
 It's like seeing an aboriginal tribesman reviewing a mobile telephone,
<BR>
 and telling all his friends that it makes an absolutely terrible
<BR>
 drumstick!
<BR>
 
<BR>
    se of the latest and greatest version of the Linux operating system,
<BR>
    Linux Mandrake 8.1.  Although �lternative" operating systems are not
<BR>
    usually of interest to Adequacy's readership, who prefer to trust us
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Mandrake is NOT a version of linux.  Linux is a unix kernel: "linus'
<BR>
 unix".  Mandrake is an operating system that uses the linux kernel and
<BR>
 adds its own user and system applications to provide what we normally
<BR>
 think of as the system.  Mandrake is commonly called a "distribution"
<BR>
 of linux.  There are many such distributions - all more or less
<BR>
 incompatible with each other, just as there are many distributions of
<BR>
 windows (windows me, windows 2000, windows 98, windows 3.1, windows NT,
<BR>
 windows whatever ..., I'm not an expert on windows distros).  Each
<BR>
 distro will have its distinct target audience/market, just like the
<BR>
 windows distros.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Of the commercially motivated linux-based distros, mandrake is one
<BR>
 which originally based itself on redhat (I think redhat is up to
<BR>
 version 7.1 or 7.2 nowadays) round about version 5 or 6.  They added
<BR>
 some user-friendly frills which I don't like at all.  I don't like
<BR>
 redhat either.  Mandrake like to number themselves about 1 more than the
<BR>
 corresponding redhat release number, I suppose for commercial reasons.
<BR>
 Oh ..  and mandrake's original gimmick was that it was "compiled for
<BR>
 pentium" - a nonsense statement in itself, but many suckers for
<BR>
 technobabble like to buy it.  It fact the code alignments they
<BR>
 performed might amount to a couple of percent performance improvement
<BR>
 over being compiled with more generic optimizations, but nobody runs a
<BR>
 pentium nowadays - we run i686 or better - so it was just "washes
<BR>
 whiter" adspeak.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Perhaps that'll orient you a bit.  Oh - and mandrakes pentium
<BR>
 optimizations were sufficiently light that it shouldn't actually stop
<BR>
 you booting on a 486.  At least, that certainly was the case in earlier
<BR>
 versions of mandrake, but of course I don't know how their kernel is
<BR>
 compiled nowadays. They do have an i486 compilation available.
<BR>
 
<BR>
    For the release of Linux Mandrake 8.1, aggressively timed to
<BR>
    coincide with that of Microsoft's much vaunted Windows XP, marks the
<BR>
    start of
<BR>
 
<BR>
 I don't think it's timed for that, but what would I know?  I imagine
<BR>
 it's timed to beat redhat to the next punch.
<BR>
 
<BR>
    Considering the enormous significance of this release,
<BR>
 
<BR>
 I don't see any significance in it at all!  8.1 is not a big step up
<BR>
 over 8.0.  It should, according to the version numbering, be just a
<BR>
 patch release, although many people seem to be complaining that it
<BR>
 indroduces more bugs than it fixes.  That's not surprising if what I
<BR>
 hear is true: they're a small operation, with a QA team of one or two.
<BR>
 redhat has at least 25, and they make bigger and better fubars too!
<BR>
 
<BR>
     The Linux operating system was born in 1991 and was created by one
<BR>
     man, a Finnish student coincidentally named Linux Torvalds.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Fail.  Linus (note the s) published his kernel, and it was taken up by
<BR>
 a cast of hundreds of programmers who transformed it into the basis of
<BR>
 an o/s.  Many such o/s's were put together, notably by sls, slackware,
<BR>
 redhat, and others.  The whole point of linux is that it is NOT the
<BR>
 work of any one man or group.
<BR>
 
<BR>
     While there are many other alternatives to Windows, including BSD
<BR>
     which is based on SUN's (Stanford University Network - correction
<BR>
     by bc) server-grade Solar
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Again, hilariously wrong.  The BSDs (openbsd, freebsd, netbsd ..) are
<BR>
 the descendents of the original unix kernel and o/s philosophies.
<BR>
 Sun's original offerings were based on BSD unix, not the other way
<BR>
 round!  Sun later helped develop system V unix, a radical departure and
<BR>
 fork, and later those unix forks merged together again in Suns solaris
<BR>
 system, while other unix os'es such as irix (sgi) or aix (ibm) pursued
<BR>
 their own lines.  Linux was originally BSD-like, because a lot of the
<BR>
 system utility codes came from there, being open code, but has grown
<BR>
 more system-V like since.  And these are not "alternatives to windows";
<BR>
 no, windows is a (poor) alternative to them, historically - windows has
<BR>
 been the poor mans choice, because the other systems either required
<BR>
 lots of money or lots of knowhow.  I mean, when a Sun machine landed in
<BR>
 my office in 1986, I put it together and got it all going and started
<BR>
 using it without any trouble, but when the engineers came round a few
<BR>
 weeks later, they told me that they were supposed to do that, because
<BR>
 it didn't come with instructions, and I was the first person to manage
<BR>
 it in the UK at least.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
       Linux Mandrake is just the latest in a long line of quirkily
<BR>
       christened versions of Linux.  Previous versions of Linux have
<BR>
       been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral.  In stark co
<BR>
       
<BR>
       
<BR>
 
<BR>
 No it isn't. Wrong.  These aren't versions of linux.  They're each
<BR>
 their own commercial operation, and their names are the names of their
<BR>
 own company.  Each is a distinct operating system.  There is no relation
<BR>
 between them apart from the fact that each is based on the linux
<BR>
 kernel, and each has access to the same sources, so they can all build
<BR>
 variants of the same applications and system stuff, if they wish.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 But we know that by now, eh?
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
      My foray into the world of Linux began by downloading a "CD image"
<BR>
      from the Linux web site.  But don't worry, this isn't software
<BR>
      piracy, it's perfectly legal!  Linux is shareware, meaning that it
<BR>
      can be freely redistributed without fear of a visit by the
<BR>
      Business Software Alliance.  The free availability of Linux is a
<BR>
      major reason for its popularity among cash-strapped students and
<BR>
      self-styled anti-capitalist hackers.
<BR>
      
<BR>
      
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Well, thanks for trying to make a literary story out of it, but no,
<BR>
 each distro costs money if you buy it.  It's the code that not only
<BR>
 MUST be freely available, by licencing, but also IS freely available,
<BR>
 and that's what you are downloading as a minimum.  On top of that, each
<BR>
 distro makes its boot isos available (I've never installed by iso, I
<BR>
 prefer to use the net), hmm ..  much as BG's enterprise tacitly
<BR>
 welcomes the copying and piracy of their supposedly costly product.
<BR>
 When was the last time you paid directly for windows?  You didn't.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
        documentation.  Unfortunately, an unpleasant surprise was in
<BR>
        store for me in the "required configuration" section of the
<BR>
        manual.  I was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on
<BR>
        Pentium processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water
<BR>
        with my old Gateway 486
<BR>
        
<BR>
        
<BR>
        
<BR>
        
<BR>
 
<BR>
 That's their major selling point!  It's what their advertising guys
<BR>
 dreamed up to make them MORE ATTRACTIVE over the other distros.  It's
<BR>
 just advert, of course.  They have a 486 version.  Go and download the
<BR>
 OTHER iso image.
<BR>
 
<BR>
        Furthermore, a whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to
<BR>
        run Linux
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Wrong.  Substitute "mandrake" for linux, and you may be nearer the
<BR>
 mark.  Of course, let's not mention this to my ibm thinkpad 500, a
<BR>
 486sx50 with 8MB of ram on which I have run linux since forever.
<BR>
 Perhaps we shouldn't believe what we read, or at least realize the
<BR>
 context of what we are reading!
<BR>
 
<BR>
 And I would have imagined that 64MB and at least a P200 was the minimum
<BR>
 sensible requirement for mandrake.  It's reputedly a frilly, topheavy
<BR>
 distro that needs a lot of gasoline.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
       many complaints.  A brief perusal of the features of Linux
<BR>
       Mandrake reveals that Linux is sorely lacking many crucial
<BR>
       productivity applications.  For example, why isn't the industry
<BR>
       standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?
<BR>
       Despite the best
<BR>
       
<BR>
       
<BR>
       
<BR>
       
<BR>
 
<BR>
 Well, apart form the lawsuit from microsoft that would result, there's
<BR>
 the little matter that microsoft haven't made the code available for
<BR>
 their NONstandard browser (see the findings of fact in the case won by
<BR>
 the DOJ), so nobody can recompile it or port it to linux.  Isn't this a
<BR>
 bit of a tyro's mistake?  Besides that, their code probably requires
<BR>
 windows support libraries!  Well, if you really wanted to you could run
<BR>
 Internet Exploder under a windows emulator in linux, but why oh why?
<BR>
 
<BR>

       efforts of the experts at the Internet Engineering Task Force to

 Errm.  Have you received the letter from the IETF yet?  They were
<BR>
 formed originally with people from netscape on!  You are severely
<BR>
 misinformed if you think that microsofts offering is the result of and
<BR>
 favoured son of the IETF.  That's as inverted a view of reality as I
<BR>
 have heard.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
       Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used
<BR>
       software is completely incompatible with Linux!  It may surprise
<BR>
       you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express,
<BR>
       or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux.  T

<BR>
       
<BR>
       
<BR>
 
<BR>
 It wouldn't surprise me at all!  Why would you expect them to?  Surely
<BR>
 you don't expect a chinese bestseller to go be comprehensible to the
<BR>
 inhabitants of birmingham, or diesel to work in a petrol car?  Whyt
<BR>
 then do you expect codes written and comipled for a winodws o/s
<BR>
 (which?) to work on solaris, irix, aix, linux, macos, netbsd, openbsd,
<BR>
 ...  blah blah???  Sure, you can run them in a windows emulator inside
<BR>
 linux, if that's what turns you on.
<BR>
 
<BR>
      Computer security is also an area that seems to have been
<BR>
      overlooked by the developers of Linux.  In these times when
<BR>
      hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn
<BR>
      that no anti-virus software is available for Linux.  To add insult
<BR>
      to
<BR>
 
<BR>
 This is embarrassingly ignorant.  Viruses can only target windows based
<BR>
 o/s's, essentially because of their lack of build in security.  There
<BR>
 is no such thing as a virus for unix based o/s's.  It's a meaningless
<BR>
 concept.  What would a virus do?  The best one could hope for is a
<BR>
 trojan that some ignorant user could be persuaded to run and which
<BR>
 might hurt his own files.  By definition it couldn't hurt anyone else's
<BR>
 or the system's files.  The things that are of concern in the unix
<BR>
 world are known as cracks and worms.  The combination of the two can be
<BR>
 dangerous.  But viruses!  No.  Hacks, cracks and worms, yes.  That's
<BR>
 what bugtraq and cert are for - to issue warnings of such things and
<BR>
 ensure that the cure is published.  Occasionally there are real
<BR>
 concerns.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
      is available for Linux.  To add insult to injury, there is no
<BR>
      Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall.  By using Linux,
<BR>
      you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne
<BR>
      
<BR>
      
<BR>
      
<BR>
      
<BR>
 
<BR>
 The linux kernel is a firewall.  You don't need additional software.
<BR>
 Mandrake comes with several fancy frilly userspace tools to configure
<BR>
 it.
<BR>
 
<BR>
 
<BR>
      The shortcomings of Linux are obvious.  Without even installing
<BR>
      Linux Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws.  Surely
<BR>
      it is not too much to expect that, after ten years of development,
<BR>
      the c
<BR>

<BR>
You have input and output chains, which you can define for each network interface. In the middle of these is the forward chain, which forwards packets between input and output. Disable the forward and no traffic goes from one network interface to the other.
<BR>

<BR>
I have a linux firewall in my home, with two network cards. Internet traffic moves in on one card, and only approved traffic goes to the other network card, which connects to my home network. Note that this doesn't simply block some traffic streams, it only accepts those streams I explicitly allow. Ofcourse, if you want to, you can also confdigure it the other way around, where it only blocks some streams, and allows everything else, because that's easier to do.
<BR>

<BR>
Ofcourse, if I had to do all of this in a business, I'd just buy one of those ready-made firewall boxes. Relatively cheap, quicker to setup, and less maintenance.

"On the Internet, a router is a device or, in some cases, software in a computer, that determines the next network point to which a packet should be forwarded toward its destination. The router is connected to at least two networks and decides which way to send each information packet based on its current understanding of the state of the networks it is connected to. A router is located at any gateway (where one network meets another), including each Internet point-of-presence."<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I would stick my neck out and suggest that several thousand Linux and BSD boxes are acting as medium level routers carrying your Internet traffic right now.  I expect it wouldn't be used for more than about 100MBit links, but then that's what specialised hardware is for.   How do I know this?  Because I set many of them up several years ago and after I finished constructing the networks several years ago no one has replaced them after several IT audits.

I'm also going to risk suggesting that all the windows-advocate flame bait is coming from people that knew this too, and they're just having fun with the nerds being outraged :-)

Haven't had this much of a laugh reading the article and reponses for a long time, good to see people still have a sense of subtle humour.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No ISP is so poor that it can't afford low end ciscos that do a better job than a hacked up linux box. Cisco routers, by the way, are based on Mac OS 4, of all things.

What you have just described is a network configuration called a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone). The idea is to have an outside firewall, that protects certain machines such as mail or web servers, that need to communicate with both the outside world and the company's intranet (internal network). The intranet then sits behind yet another firewall that is itself behind the first firewall. What results is a network in which there is an outside world, and inside world, and a zone in between separated by firewalls from both the inside and the outside. You could use linux boxes to provide both of the firewalls if you wished.

<BR>

<BR>
Using IPF (or now PF or whatever they use as their IPFilter replacement) on OpenBSD or FreeBSD, you can in fact firewall a network without using a router-- you just configure the box to filter all traffic while bridging its interfaces, so the box doesn't have any IP addresses on the networks its protecting. If you manage to compile IPF on GNU/Linux, you can in fact have a GNU/Linux box do the same thing. You can get more information on this at the OpenBSD Packet Filter HOWTO (http://www.inebriated.demon.nl/pf-howto/html/), section 3.
<BR>

<BR>
Technically, a firewall is just a software or hardare solution to filter access to a computer system. Your rigid definition isn't complete in that sense that you can FIREWALL access to a multifunction machine and it can still be considered a firewall. Granted, a seperate device that does nothing but firewalling is your best bet, but that is not a solid requirement for a machine to be called a firewall. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

You're almost right, but a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.  You need 3 DEVICES to create a physical separation between internal and external nets, and a decisionmaking 'host' to decide what can jump the void.
<BR>

<BR>
This is what a Linux firewall configuration is:
<BR>
1 NIC for external
<BR>
1 NIC for internal
<BR>
inside 1 computer HOST to route them.
<BR>

<BR>
The latest Linux kernel provides stateful packet inspection as well, which seriously improves it's standing and ability as an enterprise class firewall, but I'm sure even mentioning this has caused your eyes to glaze over and you've no doubt returned to Solitaire by now.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
A little knowledge is indeed a dangerous thing.  I should like to think
<BR>
I have a little bit more knowledge than that, so I'll share...
<BR>

<BR>
A router is a process.  A router, as most people use the term, is a little
<BR>
box with a bunch of rj-45 plugs in it, but inside, it's a small
<BR>
system permanently stuck to a hub/switch.  It takes incoming packets 
<BR>
from the WAN link port, inspects them, and routes them to the appropriate 
<BR>
internal IPs.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, check this out.  Linux box with two NICs.  NIC 1 gets an incoming 
<BR>
packet from the ISP'S ROUTER, and it goes to the HOST PROCESS for examination.
<BR>
From there it heads to the second ROUTER PROCESS, which sends it out NIC 2
<BR>
to whatever hub it's connected to.  Incoming router, firewall, 
<BR>
outgoing router.  Dang, I believe that makes your definitive firewall in
<BR>
ONE BOX, doesn't it?  Wow.
<BR>

<BR>
But that's not a very streamlined way of doing things, is it?  I mean,
<BR>
it gets the last two things done, certainly, but now that you've got them
<BR>
happening inside one box, you can streamline code like you've streamlined 
<BR>
hardware.  You can take the whole process, and 
<BR>
tighten it up a bit, make 
<BR>
it less exertion for your system.
<BR>

<BR>
You might consider adding a linux cert to your current MCSE, Alex.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyone else, feel free to correct me.

&gt;Here's a start: IP stands for Internet Protocol.
<BR>

<BR>
Here's another: TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and allows several transmissions to share one IP connection. Each conversation goes over a separate "port"; clients connect to different ports on a server depending on which service they wish to access.  For instance, HTTP normally runs over port 80, and telnet runs over port 23.

Most Linux software is written to POSIX API, which Solaris also implements. If you want free software, go to <a href="http://freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat II</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>'t, search for what you want, ./configure, make, make install, and you're off.

<BR>

<BR>
"This is plainly wrong, as anyone worth their salt in systems administration (such as me, as I have an MCSE) knows that BSD is descended from SunOS, which is Sun Microsystem's standard operating system on their mid to high-range servers currently. Obviously, with an operating system this powerful out on the web, Linux won't be able to compete for long."
<BR>

<BR>
Why do you think this makes such a powerful OS?  I mean Solaris is cool and all, but it has already lost the server war to linux. It has been around for a while now and linux is already out doing it. Not to dis you or anything, but you are an MCSE, not a UNIX guru.  As we speak, SUN is downsizing.  Its number of servers ordered has dropped dramatically, and a lot of it has to do with linux.  You can run linux on all Sun boxes, but most people don't because SUN hardware costs money.  The other thing people always forget, is that Linux is open source.  It doesn't have to compete with SUN or Windows.  It will always win, because it is free.  Now, Mandrake or Redhat might not be able to compete, but linux itself doesn't have to worry about such things.  Redhat has done quite a number on SUN though, I must say.

<BR>

<BR>
http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2816323,00.html
<BR>

<BR>
here is a netcraft study that clearly states 30% of webservers are linux and 7% are solaris, BSD holds 6%, and 2% are other Unix.
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.netcraft.com/survey/
<BR>

<BR>
If you check out the older studies, you can see Solaris losing more and more market share, where linux is gaining more and more.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't blame this on SUN, or think that SUN makes an inferior product.  I am just stating that Linux is kicking some ass in the UNIX market, and they are eating up SUN's market share.  It is hard to compete with a free OS that runs on cheap hardware.
<BR>

<BR>
I just saw something on CNN the other night about how SUN isn't selling much hardware these days, and are in real trouble.  Infact they just had some major layoffs.
<BR>

<BR>
If you would really like me to research this further, and include charts showing database servers and such I can.  I know that Linux has taken the second place spot in file servers passing Novell... I don't believe Solaris has a significant number there though.

As for the whole article written, try to run WinXP on your 486 Gateway(ha-ha), and then try to install linux on it as a server (Pentium requirement is misunderstanding by the author, it runs on Intel x86 architecture, alpha, PPC, Sparc, etc.), or a firewall router and you'll be amaze what linux can bring you.

<BR>

<BR>
RESPONSE TO PARAGRAPH 6 : 
<BR>
1. Of course its 'incompatible' you dumbass, its a WIN32 BINARY! Get a linux application 
<BR>

<BR>
2. Uh I seriously doubt youve ever heard of the Wine ( WINdows Emulator project ) nor 
<BR>
   StarOffice, or ABIWord 
<BR>

<BR>
3. It is your 'defination' of popular that is very misleading in your attempt to be an objective

reporter on this subject. As views will vary, so will your Mileage! I suggest you look into 
<BR>
LOKI GAMES for Linux, Oh ya I almost forgot, Return To Castle Wolfenstien hmmm and the
<BR>
performance specs are better UNDER LINUX than Windows... 
<BR>

<BR>
4. Wide Range of software is freely available... Ya theres that damn opensource thing again

<BR>
FINAL SUMMARY 
<BR>
You obviously have no clue as to what your talking about let alone have any information
<BR>
to prove any of the claims that you make in this posting. Its persons like you whom should
<BR>
just unplug your computer and ship it back for a full refund, Im sure your money would be 
<BR>
better invested in something like napkin folding lessons or something of that nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
I normally will not respond to posts like this from some petty-ass'd website, but I felt 
<BR>
it necessary in this particular case. This person obviously did no homework, didnt even 
<BR>
install Mandrake 8.1 nor any other Linux distro for that matter, let alone has any clue 
<BR>
as to what hes spouting off about. Nice review dumbass!

It pains me to see such misinformation in this article, though. I am not going to point out errors, as many people have already beat me to it.

You are perfectly entitled to continue using windows, but if you want the real truth about linux, come and talk to the www.arstechnica.com linux community about it on the forums there or on the arstechnica irc server (irc.arstechnica.com channel:#linux).

The sheer fact that you say this screams you are an idiot.  UNIX is older than DOS therefore it is NOT in anyway based on DOS.  Infact here's the history.
<BR>

<BR>
1.  Proprietary Software
<BR>
2.  UNIX
<BR>
3.  PL/M (Program Language for Microcomputers)
<BR>
4.  CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) 1.1
<BR>
5   CP/M 2.2
<BR>
6   BASIC
<BR>
7.  QDOS (sloppily backwards engineered version of CP/M wriiten for Intel Processors which Ms bought for $50,000 after they promised IBM an OS they didn't have)
<BR>
8.  MSDOS 1.0 (slightly recoded QDOS but with an MS label)
<BR>
9.  CP/M-86 (Sorry but since DOS, was released on IBM PCs using Intel processors the popularity marginalized this great OS)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I've heard a lot about this Linux, and at first glance it seems just the ticket for a poor parochial school. But one question I've never seen answered, does this Linux have internet filters? 
<BR>

To answer your question, Yes. Most of your internet proxy services are ran on a Linux or UNIX based system. Moreso on UNIX. But for mere sakes of supporting GNU and the free software community, take a look at Dansguardian. It is a content based filter that works with Squid to filter out bad language, sites and IP addresses. There are many others out there to use as well, but I prefer the Dansguardian.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<br><br>
I have been using Linux since 1993, 90% for 5 years, 100% for 18 months.  At work, I use Microsoft NT/2000/95 exclusively (version depends on the client).  The reason I hate, (and I admit that), Microsoft is the quality of the software.  I write software for a living, and for my personal benefit (<a href="http://sacash.sourceforge.net">sacash</a> for example).  I therefore feel like I can judge software in that manner.  BTW, This response is being written in a Mozilla 0.9.4 browser 
window, running on Mandrake 8.0 .   I prefer Linux, because I use Windows.  I fight problems in Windows, that I can never get answers to.  I've fought problems in Linux, but if need be I can always look deeper.<br> <br>
One previous message said office suites were available for linux.  This message 
was rebuked, by saying Office is a Microsoft product.  "Office" is Microsoft.  However an office suite is a collection of programs, such as KOffice, or Siag office.  Most of these programs import and export many "Office" documents.
<br><br>
Another message made a comment about firewalls.  If the author had installed Mandrake, he would have found that part of the install allows you to setup a firewall.  Point-and-click as well.<br><br>
Viruses:  There have been "worms" (I'll leave the definition to other sites) however they are completely different than windows viruses.  The fundamental difference, is that on Linux a normal user wouldn't have the ability to destroy the en
tire operating system.  On Windows 95,98,ME, and NT/2000 (without NTFS) the logged in user can delete the \windows (or \winnt etc..) directory.  On linux, unless logged on as root, this is not possible. <br><br>
To error27, this review is not objective.  Failing to actually install the operating system makes it so. <br><br>
To the author who attempted to compare Mandrake to XP:  The minium requirement for Mandrake is a 586.  However, that is because the default download is compiled to take advantage of the Pentium processor.  None of the software itself requires a Pentium.  It COULD be recompiled for a 486.  If you want to try it on a 486, try RedHat instead.  Redhat by default compiles the code for 386, making it available for older hardware but not taking full advantage of the CPU. (My install
 of Mandrake 8.0, fit the OS in 500meg<br><br>
Compare that to XP requirements. (http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/howtobu
y/upgrading/sysreqs.asp). 1.5gig for just OS.  300 Mhz processor, 64meg(limited performance)/128 meg.  So as others pointed out, XP could NEVER run on the author's 486, although one of a dozen other linux distros would.<br><br>

Is linux right for everyone?  No.  Is it getting close yes.  Was Windows, and Windows software always as it is today? No. It got more useful.  <br><br>
And I think I need to say what Open-Source is to me.  It is not having to reinvent the wheel.  It is finding an existing solution to a problem, without having to write it myself.  If that solution doesn't quite fit my problem, I can make the change, and release my change.  Now someone else may benefit as well.  An analogy would be if drug companies found new drugs and just released all the info.  How many more people could afford the drug? How many more people might live?  This isn't a perfect analogy, but it gives a feel.<br><br>
I know that not everyone is capable of changing code.  That isn't the issue.  The issue that it is out there.  In 1995, as an intern, I found a problem with a Microsoft API.  I felt it had to be a bug, and months after I left they admitted 
it was.  If the code would have been available I wouldn't have wasted a week on the problem.  If the code was open-source I could have made the change (something Microsoft's Shared-Source license doesn't allow).  There is a lot of open-source code out there that I would never dig into.  However, it makes me much happier to know someone can.<br><br>
And last to the Anonymous Coward who said "Especially in light of recent events,
 using Linux is quickly becoming indefensible. ... Linux bigotry in this context essentially equates to hatred of freedom and America." First, I didn't really understand where this comment came from.  Maybe that Linux is available free?  Second, if that is it, I completely disagree.  Open-source software allows businesses not to have to re-invent the wheel yet again.  To focus on solving business problems, instead of dealing with yet another Outlook-email virus.  To not be forced into expensive license changes, yet again. (http://www.usatoday.com/money/tech/2001-09-27-msoft-software.htm) .  Linux is the ultimate example of freedom. <br><br>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><blockquote>While there are many other alternatives to Windows, including BSD which is based on Sun's server-grade Solaris operating system, none have commanded the same level of media attention as Linux.</blockquote>
Actually, BSD was out first.  SunOS was based on BSD and Solaris is based on a different 'flavour' of Unix - SVR4 which incorporates some parts of BSD in it.

<blockquote>Previous versions of Linux have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral.</blockquote>
These are not previous versions.  They're all current versions.  A lot of vendors get the basic Linux system and package it with extra bits and pieces.  check out <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a> for their current distribution of Linux.

<blockquote>The Linux operating system was born in 1991 and was created by one man, a Finnish student coincidentally named Linux Torvalds.</blockquote>
His name is Linus Torvalds

<blockquote>I was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on Pentium processors</blockquote>
The Mandrake distribution of Linux only runs on pentiums.  However, you could have downloaded a copy of RedHat Linux which is also free and it runs on anything from a 386 up.

<blockquote>For example, why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?</blockquote>
This is a good question for Microsoft!  I'm sure if they released IE for Linux a lot of people would run it.  Anyway, there are a stack of browsers available for Linux including Netscape 6.1, Opera and Mozilla.  All are fully functional browsers - you don't lose anything by not being able to run IE.

<blockquote>Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software is completely incompatible with Linux! It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux.</blockquote>
Again, ask Microsoft.  Remember that MS see Linux as the competition so they do not release their software for it.  I think that IBM is working on a Notes client for Linux incidentally.  There are stacks of alternatives to the Office suite available.  StarOffice is the most fully functional (and it's what I use day to day).  Also, gnome-office and koffice are suites that are being developed (although they're not really ready for prime time just yet).

<blockquote>Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by the developers of Linux. In these times when hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux. To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall.
</blockquote>
Believe it or not, viruses are impossible to write under Linux.  This is because when you log in, you don't have complete priveleges to the system so you can't do stuff like format your hard drive.  You need to go into a privileged mode to do this kind of stuff and you can't go privileged without explicitly asking to do so.  So, bye bye viruses.  Also, as Linux can't run Outlook Express, that eliminates the major source of viruses being transmitted these days.  As for firewalls, well you'll find that Linux comes bundled with a firewall called 'iptables'.  It's not as easy to setup as ZoneAlarm but it's much more powerful.  I think you'll also find that Linux is pretty secure out of the box.  There aren't any C$ or Admin$ shares open to the world.  Most services are turned off (eg: telnet, ftp, file sharing) and you need to explicitly turn them on if you want them.

<blockquote>"Why bother?" After all, Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need to replace it,</blockquote>
Actually, you are paying a couple of hundred bucks hidden in the price of your PC for your 'free' copy of Windows.  Unfortunately Microsoft force your vendor to sell you windows regardless of whether you want it or not (try calling Compaq and ask for a PC but without Windows - see how far you get).  So, if I want to run Linux on a new PC, I am forced to buy the copy of windows that comes with it.

<blockquote>Although it is always tempting to support the underdog, Windows XP will be the deserved victor in the battle ahead. I recommend that those Adequacy readers who are hoping to upgrade their operating system patiently wait for the release of Windows XP, rather than foolishly wasting their time, effort and money on Linux.  
</blockquote>
I agree with you here.  I think that XP will consolidate Microsoft's position on the desktop (can it be more secure).  This is primarily for one reason - Microsoft Office.  The operating system is not as important as most people think.  The one thing that you can do on a windows PC that you can't do on any other (Macs aside - for now) is reliably edit Word documents.  Microsoft refuses to develop Word for any other platform except for Macs - and that's their privilege to do so.  But I can read my e-mail, surf the web, send instant messages - just about anything except for reliably editing a Word file on my Linux PC.  So, XP will succeed.  Not necessarily because it is better but because Microsoft back it up with an application suite that is a greater monopoly than Windows itself - Microsoft Office.

Finally, it would have been interesting to see what you thought of Mandrake had you actually installed it.  Surely you have a pentium system somewhere?  Also, a comparison of XP and RedHat Linux on your 486 would have been interesting also.

It is nothing like a serious review nor anything like an objective review.
<BR>

<BR>
To be a serious objective review the author would have had to firstly know what he was talking about. None of that capacity was demonstrated. 
<BR>

<BR>
He would also have had to have knowledge about the operating system he was thinking of installing so that he could describe any problems he found. No indication of that was seen.
<BR>

<BR>
To be objective he needed to have some background knowledge of the computer industry just slightly above the average user so that he could speak with some knowledge. Nothing like that was seen.
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry. The review wasn't serious nor objective. 
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;CITE&gt; It's not his fault linux sux so bad.&lt;/CITE&gt; 
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry. Wrong. Linux has a lot going for it no matter which distribution you decide meets your needs. Many govenrment and community bodies are adopting Linux and StarOffice as their default computer specifications. They are getting sick of the constant virus/trojan/hacking attacks and moving to something that will be stable and seriously prevent disruption to their business needs. 
<BR>

<BR>
The abuse heaped on open source prgramming is silly and self-defeating. The Internet simply could not operate at its present level without the open source community that has written the software and the protocols for it to operate. Even this site operates because they use open source software as the base of the web server as do a great many sites around the world. The cost to run the web server software's nearest Microsoft equivalent could cost well over 5 or even 10 thousand dollars depending on the configuration. Do you think that too many sites could afford to make payments like that and survive on banner fees? 
<BR>

<BR>
Please, find out more information before running down Linux and open source. There is much more out there than what Microsoft would have you believe and it is good news.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

...but apparently not above the playground grammar level.
<BR><BR>
But seriously, this review and the accompanying discussion deserve scorn.  The reviewer didn't even INSTALL the operating system for crying out loud!  From what I read, it sounds like he barely even tried.  (And I won't even get into the wisdom of trying to install an OS on a system that old without researching the requirements first.)  What kind of review is that?
<BR><BR>
And the discussion was just a total farce.  As though it wasn't bad enough that the author misspelled Linus, people actually had the nerve to <i>argue that he was right</i>!  I think that fact alone speaks very poorly of some of the people here.  All they had to do to check was go to <a href="'http://www.linux./org'">linux.org</a>.  It's right there in the first paragraph.  But no, it's much easier to blindly defend the position you like than to actually check the facts.

<BR><BR>I really hope this site is just one big joke.

I have seen some bovine-generated organic effluent posted. Some real stinky stuff. But without a doubt, starting with the article, I have never seen so much gratuitous flamebait posted anywhere in my life.
<BR><BR> 
Now, if said flamebait was the least bit informed or had a scintilla of intelligence behind it, I could almost find some redeeming qualities in it, but the anti-Linux stuff I have read here is some of the most mis-informed, mal-informed and uninformed stuff I have ever read in my life, and I have seen a bit of that stuff.
<BR><BR>
I am a Linux Newbie. Started out on Amiga, went to Windows for a while, fixed Windows machines and sold them(still do) and recently loaded Mandrake 8.0. AFter a few weeks, I wiped my HDD of Windows, reinstalled Mandrake and have not looked back. It's good. Real good. None of the security concernson has with Windows, and the apps are great,
<BR><BR>
Now, before some of you Linux Critics get found out for who you really are, and have to face the laughing and pointing you so desperately deserve, I would suggest that you give Linux a try. I did, and I am really happy for it.
<BR><BR>
Note to Mr. "Em": Before you go wasting a hour of billable time charges on that gentleman who telnetted into your server, only to see your server's banner, I would suggest you take a pill or something. You will be wasting your time, the lawyer's time and the company's money. If you cannot document any damage, or the connection, you are out of luck. Besides, why would you attempt to prosecute anything so penny-ante? SImply in the name of comparitive penile demensions?

I personally feel that this article was a joke. It was so incorrect in so many statements, that it has to be. He complains about requiring a Pentium class machine to run Mandrake Linux 8.1.. If he had read the requirements, he would have known that upfront. (Mandrake also puts out a 486 version that work on his machine, more difficult to find, but its there).. This article was written like someone buying a stereo, bringing it home, only to find out that they didn't get speakers with it. If they had only researched before, they would have known.......<BR><BR></FONT></td>

For proof: Go to microsoft.com. Search for "bsd".. Scroll through the entries till you see one label  "The WinSock API", with the following text:

If you follow the link, it'll put you to a page describing it. I won't direct link it, as it requires you to have a Passport/Hotmail account.. But since most people here seem to be Microsoft supporters, they shouldn't have a problem following the link.

<BR>

<BR>
However if you don't i'd like to point out some things.
<BR>
1. Mandrake Linux is a distrobution not a version, Mandrake releases many versions as do redhat etc.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Mandrake is aimed at pentiums, others are aimed at 486s. Also you yourself said that you use an outdated version of windows, isn't that because current versions are too resource hungry?
<BR>

<BR>
3.Internet Explorer is not the internet standard and often goes against the standard, however there are many browsers available for Linux that are more standards compliant and often just better.
<BR>

<BR>
4.MS Office for win will not work with Mac either. Linux is no different, infact there are office sweats like StarOffice that are more compatible, load MS files and are completely FREE, not hundreds of dollars.
<BR>

<BR>
5.Security, Linux is in no way as vulnerable as windows, infact there are almost no viruses in Linux, thus no reason for anti-virus software, Linux is open-source which means that anyone who finds a worm can correct it quickly and they do.
<BR>

<BR>
There are other issues with your article that I don't have time to correct, however this article should be withdrawn until you install Linux, read up on it's liscencing and learn that just because it isn't MS it isn't inferior.

A similar computer article had the discussion "crashed" by an unruly crowd of devil-may-care technological junkies, hell-bent on disrupting the otherwise orderly and useful Internet with their wild sort of "frontier" methods.  
<BR><BR>
Because this 'Linux' inhabits a legal gray area, it seems to draw in a crowd from the other side of the line -- the so-called "hackers" who, as we can see from their verbally abusive and violent mode of debate, recognize few rules, if any.  Yet they are not entirely feral.  On some level, rational discouse means something to them, and when they feel themselves losing ground aganinst those with greater education in this Liberal Art, they become angry, and their urge to violence is redoubled.  
<BR><BR>
So the last time such "Hell's Angels" of the computing world invited themselves to The Adequacy, they acted out their embarrasment by trying to wreck the place.   A devastating co-ordinated Denial Of Service Attack was launched, and Adequacy was out of communication with the rest of the world for a full year.  I was one of those <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/8/20/19500/8682">most affected</a> by this loss, but many, many people were devastatd as well.
<BR><BR>
You "Hackers" may not realize this, but this site serves a great many purposes beyond just this one article.   The Diary section, for example, is a lifeline to an entire community of us, from enthusiasts in an obscure form of recreation imported from Japan (I won't detail it here) to a thriving nymphette artist patronage system.  The Adequacy's heroic response to the recent WTC attack is well-known across both the Internet and the World Wide Web.  This last item is perhaps the one you are  most likely to have heard of.  Please, think about these things.
<BR><BR>
If you do stop and think, you will, I hope, choose not to act on your anger.  Don't copy and paste that script.  Don't run it.  Please.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">And it is probably unenforcable.  One basic reason that Linux and GPL software in general haven't moved beyond the narrow hobbyist niche is that the legal status of the so-called Copyleft is fraught with risk for any serious business venture.  What happens if it turns out that, if the GPL is ever tested in court, it proves invalid?  By it's very nature, it contradicts the basic intent of copyright law and the accepted standard for doing business in the Western world.  You may pat yourself on the back all you want for the cleversness of speciously perverting the intent of the law, but you will find that real judges in real courtrooms have no time for such Sophism.  They use simple common sense, and  common sense tells you that the GPL has twisted the intent of Copyright so far that it is unrecognizable.
<BR><BR>
So, Linux is most definitely in a "gray area."  It is like some recreational drug that is so new that the FDA hasn't yet added it to its schedule of controlled substances.  You couldn't realistically go into business selling such a drug, since you could expect to have it banned soon enough.   In the same way, Linux has so far gone under the radar of legitimate business, but for how much longer?  The smart prediction is that when Linux and/or the GPL is adjudicated in a real court of law, it will be found illegal, and so will be banned.
<BR><BR>
This doesn't even take into account the recklessness of releasing the "source code" to the irresponsible masses.  Users can do anything they want with Linux and it's (few) applications.  Thus, any instance of Linux is a potential cracker's tool.   Unlike the responsibly binary-only releases by Micro-Soft, Linux is virtually guranteed to be used to violate the law sooner or later.  It just makes it too easy.  Linux is like giving away loaded guns with no safety.  How long do you expect a civilized nation of laws to tolerate this situation?  
<BR><BR>
This is exacerbated by the <i>type</i> of wild-eyed maniac who is the typical Linux junkie.  In practical terms, each and every installation of Linux <i>is</i> being used for cracking.  The Linux fiend can't help himself, and among his gang respect for law, or for property, or for even the basics of civil discourse are utterly alien.  
<BR><BR>
Simply glance at the Linux response to this article.  Numerous threats against the Adequacy server, and at least two documented cases of hacking.  Several threats of physical violence.  Uncounted cases of verbal assault, insults, and some of the most foul and obscene language I have <i>ever</i> read on this site.  We know how you are, you Linux hackers!  You yourselves bear witness to your crimes and perversions.  How can you deny what is plainly evident here in this very discussion?
<BR><BR>
I don't know what to make of your two "cases" that you mention.  It seems a banality to me.  You can read any article and surmise that the piece either is or is not a satire.  How does that have any bearing on whether or not you believe the facts presented?  If you think one of the statements in this article is not entirely accurate, post your criticism of that.  So far I've seen nothing that credibly supports this odd accusation.   Neither the general conclusions, nor the specifics of this piece have been refuted in the least.  The author and this site have been insulted, they have been threatened, and numerous four-letter words have been hurled.  But refuted?  Where?
<BR><BR>
As far as <i>when</i> you may move on, I have no idea what they power structure of a cracker gang is.  I suppose you have a leader of some kind, and that the gang will move on when he tells you to.  Unless one of you wants to challenge his authority in some sort of "rumble."  I sometimes wish Adequacy was not so courageous in taking on topics like this.  Any discussion of Linux always attracts a dangerously violent and lawless element to the site, and it takes days for a sense of security to return after they have moved on.  I just hope that this time they will not wreck the site before they move on to other crimes.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">"And it is probably unenforcable. One basic reason that Linux and GPL software in
<BR>
general haven't moved beyond the narrow hobbyist niche is that the legal status of the
<BR>
so-called Copyleft is fraught with risk for any serious business venture. What happens if it
<BR>
turns out that, if the GPL is ever tested in court, it proves invalid? By it's very nature, it
<BR>
contradicts the basic intent of copyright law and the accepted standard for doing business
<BR>
in the Western world. You may pat yourself on the back all you want for the cleversness
<BR>
of speciously perverting the intent of the law, but you will find that real judges in real
<BR>
courtrooms have no time for such Sophism. They use simple common sense, and common
<BR>
sense tells you that the GPL has twisted the intent of Copyright so far that it is
<BR>
unrecognizable."
<BR>
You are right that the GPL has never been tested in court. But you are wrong about what
<BR>
you say about the GPL, and copyright.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Actually the main purpose for a copyright is not profit, it's control.
<BR>

<BR>
This is exactly what the GPL provides, only the author wants other people to see the code,
<BR>
but he does not want them to modify his work without releasing the source code.  
<BR>

<BR>
It's a lot more comparable to voluntary charity than to a communist police state.  
<BR>

<BR>
"So, Linux is most definitely in a "gray area." It is like some recreational drug that is so
<BR>
new that the FDA hasn't yet added it to its schedule of controlled substances. You couldn't
<BR>
realistically go into business selling such a drug, since you could expect to have it banned
<BR>
soon enough. In the same way, Linux has so far gone under the radar of legitimate
<BR>
business, but for how much longer? The smart prediction is that when Linux and/or the
<BR>
GPL is adjudicated in a real court of law, it will be found illegal, and so will be banned."
<BR>
Can you please explain how it could be legally banned. It contains no parts which would
<BR>
constitute an illegal contract.
<BR>

<BR>
It does contain something's, when it comes to keeping the derived code opensource which
<BR>
could be constituted as invalid though.
<BR>

<BR>
This is why some people are afraid about what will happen when the GPL goes to court.
<BR>

<BR>
"This doesn't even take into account the recklessness of releasing the "source code" to the
<BR>
irresponsible masses. Users can do anything they want with Linux and it's (few)
<BR>
applications. Thus, any instance of Linux is a potential cracker's tool. Unlike the
<BR>
responsibly binary-only releases by Micro-Soft, Linux is virtually guranteed to be used to
<BR>
violate the law sooner or later. It just makes it too easy. Linux is like giving away loaded
<BR>
guns with no safety. How long do you expect a civilized nation of laws to tolerate this
<BR>
situation?"
<BR>
Have you ever tried BSD. It releases the code in a much more liberal manner. Even
<BR>
Micro-Soft uses code which is released under it's extremely unrestricted license.  
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"This is exacerbated by the type of wild-eyed maniac who is the typical Linux junkie. In
<BR>
practical terms, each and every installation of Linux is being used for cracking. The Linux
<BR>
fiend can't help himself, and among his gang respect for law, or for property, or for even
<BR>
the basics of civil discourse are utterly alien."
<BR>
I do agree that Linux and BSD are common OS for crackers. I think this is mostly because
<BR>
Linux and BSD cheap, it would simply cost more to legally attain an equally powerful OS
<BR>
from Micro-Soft, or Sun. Most people would probably try to bootleg them. Have you ever
<BR>
been in China? I was there on a business trip. I was offered Windows 2000 Advanced
<BR>
Server, on the street, for about $50.
<BR>

<BR>
But his does not make "practically" every Linux and BSD user a cracker. I use both BSD
<BR>
and Linux at work, where I set up servers for legitimate business. I also use Linux at
<BR>
home, as an excellent software developing platform. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not a cracker and I know tons people who are not crackers who use Linux and BSD.   
<BR>

<BR>
"Simply glance at the Linux response to this article. Numerous threats against the
<BR>
Adequacy server, and at least two documented cases of hacking. Several threats of
<BR>
physical violence. Uncounted cases of verbal assault, insults, and some of the most foul
<BR>
and obscene language I have ever read on this site. We know how you are, you Linux
<BR>
hackers! You yourselves bear witness to your crimes and perversions. How can you deny
<BR>
what is plainly evident here in this very discussion?"
<BR>
I do agree that there is a very vocal minority of Linux Users who don't really know how to
<BR>
act.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"I don't know what to make of your two "cases" that you mention. It seems a banality to
<BR>
me. You can read any article and surmise that the piece either is or is not a satire. How
<BR>
does that have any bearing on whether or not you believe the facts presented? If you think
<BR>
one of the statements in this article is not entirely accurate, post your criticism of that. So
<BR>
far I've seen nothing that credibly supports this odd accusation. Neither the general
<BR>
conclusions, nor the specifics of this piece have been refuted in the least. The author and
<BR>
this site have been insulted, they have been threatened, and numerous four-letter words
<BR>
have been hurled. But refuted? Where?"
<BR>
I disagree. I have seen several post here who have really pointed out valid points of major
<BR>
factual errors in this article. And who have done so in a nice way. 
<BR>

<BR>
"As far as when you may move on, I have no idea what they power structure of a cracker
<BR>
gang is. I suppose you have a leader of some kind, and that the gang will move on when
<BR>
he tells you to. Unless one of you wants to challenge his authority in some sort of
<BR>
"rumble." I sometimes wish Adequacy was not so courageous in taking on topics like this.
<BR>
Any discussion of Linux always attracts a dangerously violent and lawless element to the
<BR>
site, and it takes days for a sense of security to return after they have moved on. I just
<BR>
hope that this time they will not wreck the site before they move on to other crimes." 
<BR>

<BR>
I have seen a port scan that was posted on this site. I usually only do these on clients,
<BR>
since some people get angry if you scan them without their knowledge. Although it is
<BR>
technically not illegal.
<BR>

<BR>
As a systemadmin I can tell you that this site either has an extremely exotic and
<BR>
uncommon network setup, or this sites sysadmin is just as clue less as the guy who wrote
<BR>
this article.
<BR>

<BR>
I have to say, I have seen a lot of unfounded arguments from people who defend this site. Including you. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

The whole scientific community is making a big mistake by releasing the human genome sequence because this information is virtually guranteed to be used to violate the law sooner or later (may be by producing biological weapons or human clones?).

If you want to talk about gray areas...
<BR>

<BR>
Microsoft itself is the world's BIGGEST legal gray area. You may not have noticed, but the Federal Goverment want to put the smackdown on Microsoft. A number of states want to bitchslap Bill Gates. The European Union are looking into Microsoft's affairs. Novell are suing them. And so on ad infinitum. They're the cigarette manufacturers of computer software.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the GPL being a "legal gray area"... well, the "Terms And Conditions" on this very site are more of a legal gray area. They're about as enforceable as a total ban on breathing.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the so-called "facts" in this article, they're nonsense. The reviewer cannot even get right the NAME of the guy who originated Linux. Oh dear, Linux is rubbish because it doesn't run Microsoft Software. Where does it claim anywhere that Linux does? You might as well claim that a DVD players is rubbish because you can't watch your favourite VHS tapes on it. 
<BR>

<BR>
btw, I work as an Oracle DBA (and yes, I use telnet daily) on a rather large Sun Unix box. It doesn't run Windows. I guess I ought to get my company to ditch it and run our banking systems on a Windows XP box, because any OS which doesn't run Windows software can't be much cop according to the article...
<BR>

<BR>
This article is in no wise a considered review of "Mandrake, the latest version of Linux" (another fundamental factual error) and anyone who SERIOUSLY considers it anything other than humourous are deluding themselves. Adequacy are to be commended on producing a fine piece of comedy, but that can hardly be considered courageous.

<BR>

<BR>
Linux and GPL software has moved way beyond the narrow hobbyist niche.  You can see my post above.  I have worked at many companies and they couldn't function without GPL software.  I am positive that every company that is on the web, in some way uses atleast one piece of GPL'ed software.  So it just isn't true... You probably use GPL'd software and you don't even know it.  You obviously aren't in the biz (not that even matters, there is more to life than computers), so I don't think you could comment on that.

<BR>

<BR>
What is wrong with giving away the source to software?  What better way is there to develop a piece of software and to find bugs in it.  This is a free country (US) and almost a free world.  A butter knife, hammer, even puddle of water is a potential murder weapon.  Should they all be outlawed, even though they all have practical uses?  It is just unbelievable that you think opensource should be outlawed...  Should credit cards and screw drivers be outlawed because they can be used to jimmy open locks?  I think I made my point.  
<BR>

<BR>
Linux has a bit more than a "few" applications.  I am starting to believe you are about as knoledgable as the writer of this original aticle.  The point is, Windows can and is used as a cracker tool... You are misinformed if you think that all "hackers" and "crackers" are linux users.  Not to mention you don't really understand the meaning of the word hacker, but I am not openning that can of worms.

<BR>
Fist off, it is just Microsoft, no hyphen.  I don't think that MS was thinking, "let's be responsible and only release binary versions of our software."  I am sure if there was more money in open source, then that is the way they would have gone.  I think it is more greed that made up Bill Gate's mind.  Linux is already used to violate the law... NEWS FLASH!!! So is widows.  You think all the little script kiddies flooding Yahoo and such are running linux?  Nah... most of those idiots are using MS windows.  They do make "cracker" tools for windows you know?  For the most part, the kids that do that crap never touched the source code except to compile it into a binary.  That is why they are called "script kiddes."  They take other people's software, and use it to attack servers... They have no knowledge of writing code, or tweaking the linux kernel.  If the scripts they used were available as a close binary, they would use those instead of having to compile some other persons code.  For some reason you have it stuck in your head that these kinds of attacks wouldn't be possible without linux and opensource.  The sad truth is that they really have nothing to do with it, and if it wasn't for opensource software, most of the targets they hit wouldn't even be available.  Do you really think that the internet and software in general would be anywhere near where it is today without opensource?  You do understand that virtually all e-mail travels at some point through an opensource mailserver (sendmail, postfix, qmail...).  You do also know that apache is the most widespread webserver in the world right?  You do also understand that no Microsoft product(s) come anywhere close to the status that these opensource servers have at this time. right?
<BR>

<BR>
Another thing I find you are mistaken on is that Microsoft is  doing the companies that use them good by keeping thier software closed in a binary.  My personal belief is quite the opposite.  Why do you think that microsoft computers are the target of such attacks on a regular basis?  Because it is EASY to crack MS products!  Why?  Because they don't let more than a few hundred eyes look at the source code for mistakes.  Proven servers like Apache Web server have been looked by thousands and thousands of people.  If a bug or hole is found, you can bet there is a patch available within hours.  Usually people that find these bugs are other programmers that are looking at the code and not malicious users.  With closed source code like MS the people that find your bug and security flaws are "crackers" and often malicious users.  Who do you think is more likely to write a patch and publish it and who do you think is more likely to write a script for all the script kiddies to use and attack corporate sites?  My bet is the programmer that works on Apache is going to submit a bug report or even go one step further and write the code out for the Apache dev team themselves.  You know why? Cause opensource hackers do it for that warm fuzzy feeling they get inside when they write something that people need or fix something that needs to be fixed.  Script Kiddies that care little about advancing computer technology get that feeling from watching Yahoo and ebay go down in flames after launching a DDoS.  You get the idea?  The bad guys aren't using the ability to see the code, so if you take away opensource, they will still exist and still attack sites.  Linux doesn't hack websites, lusers (luser=end user, not loser) hack websites.

"This is exacerbated by the type of wild-eyed maniac who is the typical Linux junkie. In practical terms, each and every installation of Linux is being used for cracking. The Linux fiend can't help himself, and among his gang respect for law, or for property, or for even the basics of civil discourse are utterly alien." 
<BR>

<BR>
Generalize much?  You seemed to be an intelligent even educated person until you hit this point.  How many linux "junkies" do you really know?  I mean personally.  Are their eyes infact wild?  Are they all maniacs?  How do you know that each and every installation of Linux is being used for cracking?  I personally have install hundreds if not thousands of linux boxes, and only a few of them have been used for cracking.  Most of them deliver e-mail, serve webpages, store data, and answer dns requests.  I admit that I am a linux "junkie", and I love it.  It is a lot of fun to hack, crack, whatever you want to call it.  I don't do it to hurt other people though.  That is the key point.  I do it to advance the computer industry, and to look for security flaws for I am a network security specialist.  Wait a second... Bill is that you?  The point is, I am a linux junkie and you know nothing about me, but claim to.

"I don't know what to make of your two "cases" that you mention. It seems a banality to me. You can read any article and surmise that the piece either is or is not a satire. How does that have any bearing on whether or not you believe the facts presented? If you think one of the statements in this article is not entirely accurate, post your criticism of that. So far I've seen nothing that credibly supports this odd accusation. Neither the general conclusions, nor the specifics of this piece have been refuted in the least. The author and this site have been insulted, they have been threatened, and numerous four-letter words have been hurled. But refuted? Where?"
<BR>

<BR>
Look up above... I tore the article a new one, and backed it up pretty well I think... I am not here to give a linux lesson though, so I won't.

"Any discussion of Linux always attracts a dangerously violent and lawless element to the site, and it takes days for a sense of security to return after they have moved on. I just hope that this time they will not wreck the site before they move on to other crimes."
<BR>

<BR>
Well... I may actually agree with you on some of this.  I don't know about violence, most of the people that give that kind of response are 15 and stupid.  I mean I am an adult, and would never respond that way, yet I still use linux... amazing... I just want to know, what did a GNU Linux user ever do to you?  Did they break your heart?  Leave you at the alter?  It just seems like something really bad happened to you.
<BR>

<BR>
"Beyond keeping this dangerous information out of the hands of the lonely teenagers and the frustrated desktop-support help-line workers that make up the Free Software Underground, I worry that it is too dangerous for the typical university as well. Here in USia, Ivan, university faculties are lousy with hippies, anarchists and COMMUNISTS, who ride bicycles to work, refuse to eat meat, and collaborate with such entities as the GREEN PARTY. You can imagine the kind of reckless stunts they will pull with the Human Genome in their hands. Can you imagine the kind of "demonstrations" or "direct actions" (code words that simply mean "terrorism") they would cook up?"
<BR>

<BR>
hehe... I'm a vegetarian too.  You must really HATE me!  I am starting to catch on to you now though... You fear what you can't explain, and what you know little about.  Tell me now why it is wrong to be vegetarian and care about the environment...  Should I consume with wreckless abandone as well as use binary software.  The very fact that you use the words dangerous when explaining linux, and comparing it to druggies and whatnot, now even talking about hippies a little and the Green Party.  Hmmm... conservative republican right?  I see where this is all going, and when you decide to open a book, or go to a website and read up a little on the topics being discussed, then get back to me sometime.  I think what your problem is that you base your idea of the GNU/Linux community on what you read on message boards and forums...  These are not actual linux guru's but little kids doing what they do to piss you off, and it is obvious that they have succeeded.  How does that feel?  The little kiddies are really getting to you.
<BR>

<BR>
For the record, GPL is not the only opensource license out there, one of my favorites is the BSD license.  There are actually probably over a hundred licenses besides the GNU GPL that could be considered opensource.
<BR>

<BR>
Its progress, and you can't stop that.

<i>What happens if it turns out that, if the GPL is ever tested in court, it proves invalid?</i>

<i>common sense tells you that the GPL has twisted the intent of Copyright so far that it is unrecognizable</i>
<BR><BR>
The intent of the copyright monopoly, as set out by the framers of the United States Constitution, is "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" by giving authors a time-limited window in which to dictate terms under which a work may be used. (However, the entertainment industry has been <a href="http://everything2.com/?node=sonny+bono+copyright+extension+act">slowly compromising the "time-limited window" part</a>.) A contract called a "license agreement", such as the GNU GPL, spells out those terms.

It seems to me that adequacy.com is trying to get its hit count up so they publish a story like this.  Publishing a story like this will absolutely get the hit count up on your server and very quickly.  You could also publish a religious story bashing other religions and that would work too.

<BR>

<BR>
Windows is intended for the basic user. People who simply want to surf the net,check e-mail and play games and are happy with and have no desire to change or fine tune their O/S.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is for more advanced users. People who want *FULL* control of their environment. Linux allows you full access to the source code. If you don't like anything (yes anything!) you can edit it and make it the way you like and re-compile it. Linux is a networking operating system,and as far as security goes......if your linux box isn't secure it's your own fault. Linux is not a company linux is just the name of the kernel that runs the operating system. RedHat is a company/organization that has an opinion on what they think is the best combination of apps and daemons that should be controled by the Linux kernel. Slackware,SuSe,and Mandrake have their own opinions/ideas as well. Linux itself is not user friendly and has never been. The diffrent companies are trying to provide technical support to help ease the pain of the average user and help them slide more comfortably into the bigger picture.&lt;/rant&gt; My point is once again Linux and Windows are completely diffrent. If you don't understand it don't bash it. -=&lt;cyplex&gt;=-

  We recently changed ISP's and decided to upgrade our whole infrastructure at the same time since our machines were getting quite old. Not to mention the problems with Code Red and Macro-viruses and such. A few of our techies got together and decided to use linux. We are quite pleased with the results and saved alot! Our apache servers our suiting our needs. The imap mail and apache combined with an open source product called phpGroupware does everything exchanged did for us for free. Our firewall was quite easy to set up a private LAN and a DMZ, it's an open source project called shorewall. It works for us. But do what you like! We did hire an administrator, we chose an MCSE who also loves linux and is currently a senior working on his computer science degree. That degree will allow him to grow in our company. We write software for NASA satellites, pretty much all of it is science applications running on linux beowulf clusters. It's our thing, and we like it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ok, lets see.  You couldn't get Linux to run on you 486 - hmmm!  Well, there are a few variants of the kernel.  The common version is for cpu's at 568/686 types - regardless of manufacturer, that being Intel or AMD.  Then there's the kernel that's generally labeled as a "386" specific kernel.  I can't tell you how many people turn there formally only good as a doorstop old 386/486 computers into very capable gateway/router computers for their home lan setup.  And the damn things are like the ever ready bunny - they keep going, and going,...
<BR>

<BR>
Now, lets consider the the "ppc" kernel?!  You know "PPC" aka Power PC!  Gee, Linux runs on the MAC?  Sure does, and quit well.  So lets quickly review.  we have Linux for i386, Alpha, PowerPC, SPARC, S/390, AXP and more.  
<BR>

<BR>
Now, lets deal with another issue.  I'm an R.N. I have no programming experience or knowledge.  I have no system or network administration experience.  I am running SuSE 7.2 Pro.  It has the 2.4.4-4GB kernel. I am running an Nvidia GForce-2 MX card with the lastest, 1251 series nVidia drivers.  I get about an average of 60 FPS in games like Unreal Tournament, Quake3A, Rune, Tribes2, Heretic,and....  I have a Celeron 800, I have 360MB ram.  a nic, Ensonic/SB sound card, cdrw and cd, an adaptec scsi card for an "old" style zip drive, and HPT 370 on-board ATA-100 IDE controller on an Abit BE6-II, rev2.0 mobo.  The First time I put in the CD for 7.1 It recognized and set everytyhing up "everything".  Then when I upgraded to 7.2 it went flawlessly (wish I could say that when I went from 98 to 98SE).  My friend (a masters candidate in Comp Engineering at a big ten school) has an Abit AMD board with a thunderbird 900.  His set up flawlessly as well. I got 6 CD's with my disto and a DVD (my friend used this - nice, no switching cd during install).  It came with Apache, Sendmail, Postfix. It comes with so many programs that I could set up a complete network and all the desktop terminals for a complete corporation.  
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
So the only conclusion that might be arrived at is that you A) did something grossly wrong, B) have some very exotic hardware, C) had a corrupted or outdate ISO of a Linux distro, 0r D) have an ulterior motive for posting this article.  Your facts are grossly inaccurate.  And, If I were to believe you I would be further baffled as to why places like "The White House", Korean Air Lines, SIAC (you know the people that run the servers and databases for the NYSE and AMEX) have all switched to Linux exclusively.  There are quit a few more large Corporation that have switched to Linux (like large automobile manufacturers and oil companies) that have also have switched to Linux.  
<BR>

<BR>
I got a couple viruses in my email.  I executed them for fun. I laughed as they chewed up a few cpu cycles and then fell on thier face - no .vbs to exploit.  No, buffer overflows to take control.  The truth be known.  Most hackers use Windows.  The script kiddies the run the trojans love windows.  They can slip in these programs and subtly change the registy and file types in order to hide.  In Wisconsin, a 13 year old hacker that brought down several networks with DDoS attacks states he relies on Windows - since he can't crack Unix systems. Unlike present Unix systems with udp, tcp, icmp, and igmp protocals.  Windows systems don't allow full protocal implentations of all these types.  XP will allow this - so look forward to an avalange of attacks, cracks and data theft.  Look for more network latancy and failures.  Code Red and Nimda will seem like a weak prelude to whats coming. 
<BR>

<BR>
I have to wonder what you quailifications for writing this article are.  You seem to have a very limited ablility to say the least.  This isn't an MCSE/Unix issue.  Any MCSE could set up Linux in a heartbeat.  And if they ran into a problem - there's a plethora of info and man pages installed by default with the distro - they would learn and have it up and running shortly.  
<BR>

<BR>
Frankly, I find this article dubious to say the least.  Please, get the facts straight and try getting the right image file.  Or, if you really want to see what Linux is like and have problems try buying a boxed set.  Personal edition run about $30 U.S. and Pro versions (with more code then you can load on a stock system) run about $70 U.S.  All with 60 - 90 days completed support (often much longer, I've heard people getting prompt answers over two years afterwards).

<BR>

<BR>
If however you need flexibility and you are willing to put up with the initial learning curve of a unix like os then that is for you. If you like to know how the "innards" work and how you can change that to suite your particular needs then I think most flavours of Unix will suit one fine. Granted most people do not need/want to do this, so then Windows or Mac is avialable.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not going to go into the rational behind the reviewers statements but my point is that there is not one OS to satisfy all needs.
<BR>

<BR>
I would say Linux at this stage is good server OS  but given time it could gain a place on the desktop, many use it this way already.
<BR>

<BR>
For now I would give my users Windows desktops so because they don't need the added flexibility of Linux/Unix in general.
<BR>

<BR>
For my servers I would use a flavour of Unix because I like the flexibility it offers.
<BR>

<BR>
Hopefully someone will read this and agree with me.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If only your reviewer had spent a just little time in research he may not have posted in public giving everybody to opportunity to point out his shortcomings.
<BR>

<BR>
"the latest and greatest version of the Linux operating system, Linux Mandrake 8.1."
<BR>
Nope, just the release of the next version of Linux put out by the Mandrake people. Not timed against anything of MS. It was due, had been updated, checked, beta tested, released. A full cycle of production with the next release on its way.
<BR>

<BR>
"The Linux operating system was .. created by ... coincidentally named Linux Torvalds."  How hard is it to do research and find the guy's name is Linus? Linux is a play on the words, "Linus's Unix" as he originally wrote his kernel program to be a easily accessible version of Unix.
<BR>

<BR>
"until recently Linux has eluded mainstream acceptance." Kidding us aren't you? In the server market Linux derivatives such as Apache and others make up a goodly majority of the server market, better than 60%. MS has less than 30% and only last week Gartner Group strongly advised companies to drop their MS Servers and move to iPlanet or Apache because of the security problems of the MS Products. Linux is also doing very well in desktops and may beat MS there within a year or so especially with free Office products out like StarOffice and OpenOffice.
<BR>

<BR>
"Linux Mandrake is just the latest in a long line of quirkily christened versions of Linux. Previous versions of Linux have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral". OK, as you obviously don't understand it, Linux is the basic kernel, the nuts and bolts, and every distribution (distro) uses the same kernel as its base. They add in other components, configuration, utilities, graphic engines, office tools etc to make up their own distribution. The different names reflect the companies or groups that have prepared and produced the distribution. BTW, Corel is the name of the last distro that you were thinking of, not Coral &lt;sigh&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
"its popularity among cash-strapped students and self-styled anti-capitalist hackers." Linux is part of some of the world's biggest companies and it is free for them too. Don't be making silly remarks to cover up your ignorance of the computing industry.
<BR>

<BR>
"Before installing new software, it is always advisable to read the documentation." Had you read the requirements you would have read that Mandrake is a distro that has been optimised for Pentiums and above. Red Hat and FreeBSD and many other distros contain components for systems running on 386 chips and above to Athlon or Itanium and can handle up to 8 processors well, 256 with special hardware.
<BR>

<BR>
"blatantly incorrect." The only thing incorrect and blatantly so has been the reviewer but wait more mistakes await us dear reader.
<BR>

<BR>
"sorely lacking many crucial productivity applications." Now you have to be joking. There are many hundreds of applications available for Linux systems and in many cases they are free to be downloaded and used. SQL servers, Office suites, CAD systems, graphic design, web servers, the list is too long but wait, these are nearly all with unlimited seats so it doesn't matter how big or small your company is, the same program runs for as many seats as needed without licensing problems. Try that, free programs and unlimited licenses, sure I bet MS has dozens of programs like that.
<BR>

<BR>
"the Internet Explorer standard". Joke. With Linux you can use Netscape, Opera, Lynx, Konquorer and other browsers depending on your needs. These by the way are standard, they comply much closer with W3C HTML standards than IE ever has.
<BR>

<BR>
"It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux." And it may surprise the reviewer that under WINE or Win4Lin even those programs may soon be able to run under Linux though whether you would want their bloatware and hefty licensing costs is debatable. Alternatives are available and less likely to fail or bloat your system.
<BR>

<BR>
"Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by the developers of Linux." Another Joke? Linux is based on Unix and has, out of the box, higher security than anything that MS has to offer. And has been offering high security from the early days. Very few hacks and trojans have been written for Linux as it has had only very few vulnerabilities discovered. You see, it is tested to destruction by a large contributor and testing team. Not just in the office at Redmond but across the world on a range of machines and systems that MS can only dream about as a test bench. Linux is secure where MS is far from it. Linux has a firewall available and on by default in every distro. It doesn't need ZoneAlarm, like Windows does, because it hasn't the open doors brought about by sloppy programming like Windows does.
<BR>

<BR>
"Windows XP will be the deserved victor in the battle ahead." BUT at what cost? How much to upgrade to handle it?  How much to add a decent firewall and Antivirus program? How much to add in Office XP? When all you need is a download of Linux and the supporting disks and a download of StarOffice to have pretty well the same and all it has cost you has been either the time or buying the CDs from a dealer for a few dollars? Sorry, your reviewer has no idea what he is talking about.

The original article was, of course, poor, but that is irrelevant: from the posts, not only can one find technical accuracy (or get within spitting distance of it) but more complete answers to issues such as the character of Linux/MS advocates and thus of Linux/MS software.
<BR>
  The truth is that any modern OS distribution (and XP is rather like a distribution of Linux in that it includes a lot of supplementary software) is teetering on the brink of "complexity", of being an incomprehensible system.  The contents of Red Hat Linux 7.1 standard edition, it has been estimated, took 8000 man years of effort to create in total*.  It is therefore beyond the scope of any individual's comprehension.  That a modern OS isn't far, far worse is necessarily the triumph of division of labour, but any "guiding vision" is impossible to implement in any detail (and when coding, detail matters).  That's why Open Source is good - it just acknowledges the way things actually have to happen now and provides a mechanism for this Mongol Hordes approach to work.  Linux (and I mean the whole software/cultural phenomenon), as someone pointed out, sucks, but less than the Windows equivalent.  It's incredible how a (rather amorphous) thing that will make a computer do anything you want has evolved as if it has a hive mind, some strange force pushing it in certain directions at certain crucial times - now concentrating on the interface, for instance.  Internal competion, amateurish and professional fiddling and *massively* inefficient, often awful, often beautiful coding is sifted by a hundred distributions, by magazine cover disks and in borrowed CD burns, and over the infinity of pathways between developer/users across the internet.  
<BR>
That's why the angry posts by understandably annoyed Linux zealots are a facet of what make Linux so good: communication, however ill-considered; quick and dirty evaluation that, multiplied a millionfold, forms the hive mind, and it's beautiful.
<BR>
Amusingly, after writing this, the Adequacy server (apache - open source) crashed, spoiling my post.  Ho hum.

But I know for instance that Mandrake, Slack Ware, Redhat  et.al are not release names ah la Windows Chicago an so on.  These are in fact different distributions.  A bit like different brands of beer.  Mandrake is just one such embodiment of Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
And it is possible to run Linux on 486 machines as well as many other types of hardware.  You just have to download the correct software.  I do not think Mandrake has released anything but 586 ISO image files but you could download the Mandrake source files and build Mandrake for you platform of choice.  Try this with MS Windows sometime.  I will grant you this is probably beyond the capabilities of this reviewer.  This is no real slam... it is beyond me too at my present newbie state.
<BR>

<BR>
The reviewer complains that Linux does not run MS Internet Explorer.  Now do you think Microsoft is planing to release a versionof IE that runs in Linux?  Fat Chance.  This comment of course applies to the reviewers other wants MS Office, Outlook (alias the virus lure).  This is not Linux's fault.  It just show Microsofst bias and vertual hold on what you are likely to see in the software world.  Hum, but this isn't noncompetitive behavior???   Netscape Communicator and Netscape 6.1 both run under linux and Communicator 4.78 is included with the Mandrake release that this reviewer could not run.  A whole host of other browsers run as well.
<BR>

<BR>
Anti-virus is not really necessary in Linux.  It tends to protect itself by its vary nature and structure.  Only the root user (system manager) can do any real damage to the system so it is relatively virus immune (at least while you are working with it on a day to day basis).
<BR>

<BR>
Actually, I have been impressed at the amount of software available and the support that is easily found.  But please be aware running Linux in all of its current flavors is much more work and requires a higher level of computer savvy than does Windows.  Something that this reviewer did not come to find out since they never ran it but felt inclined to review it anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
As to why anyone would even bother running Linux...the answer is Windows XP itself and Microsoft new pay-as-you-go philosophy.  I guess the reviewer has no problem letting Microsoft charge his credit card monthly as they are soon going to want to do.  I for one am drawing the line at this particular encroachment on my liberty.

<BR>
Here are some issues:
<BR>

<BR>
1.  Linux Torvalds &gt;&gt; His name is LINUS not Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  References to Red Hat, Caldera, etc as being PREVIOUS version of the Linux kernel.  They are names of various distros not versions.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  While there are many other alternatives to Windows, including BSD which is based on SUN's (Stanford University Network - correction by bc) server-grade Solaris operating system, none have commanded the same level of media attention as Linux.  &gt;&gt;  True but the BSDs are based on Unix 4.4 not SunOS.  Also SUN is not a reference to Stanford.  It's a reference to Sun Microsystems.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Linux is NOT shareware.  It's more closely related to FREEWARE if you still want to make the idiotic comparison.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  There are quite a few more screw ups on the FACTS that I will not bother wasting my time with.  Let's see if the other editors can spot them.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There are more than 1 on the installation CD's and you can download several others if you prefer free of charge.  Can't get Office running ?  Try Wine or Win4lin, you can run it with either.  Linux is shareware ?  This to shows you have no clue what your even talking about.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I caught the "oops we screwed up" line at the top of the article; you still have only about 2 facts correct:
<BR>
1. There is an operating system called Linux Mandrake 8.1
<BR>
2. Yes, Linux Mandrake 8.1 only runs on Pentium or higher chips.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux runs on just about anything, and if you want to run it on your old 486 you can download Suse or Red Hat (note: they are not PREVIOUS distributions) and do that.  Yes, the High End GUI's take some serious RAM, but then again, so did Windows 95 (16MB my foot, I had that on a 486 and it crawled like a slug).  On the other hand, system admins of cash-strapped, mostly volunteer, organizations can take that same 486 and use it for things like firewalling (you don't need extra software you idiot, it's built in to the kernel, and besides, Mandrake comes with Bastille which it about the tightest firewall I've seen, and it's included for ADDED protection, like I said, NAT is built into the kernel).  Oh, they could also use it for a web server or even a light mail-server.  With whatever RAM it has; though, admittedly, you'll have to add some more for a high traffic site.  Can as MS product be a server with that flexibility on a 486?  Nope, don't even try.
<BR>

<BR>
As for software.  No Internet Explorer?  Yup.  Because MS won't port it to Linux.  You blame that on Mandrake?  Do you blame rape victims as well?  Mandrake comes with Konqueror, built into the KDE desktop.  It also has the latest Mozilla and Opera can also be used.  If you're nostalgic you can use Netscape 4.x, or even text-based web browsers.  Konqueror and Mozilla are tops, Opera is commericial or "ad ware".  Quite frankly, if you would have actually taken the time to INSTALL the OS before reviewing it, you would have found this out.
<BR>

<BR>
As for not being able to run MS Office in Linux, yes...you typically can't run software from OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS in any OS.  However, Office 97 runs fine in Linux useing the WINE execution layer; as do many other programs.  Even so, Star Office a FREE suite, can translate MS docs with varying degrees of success; and Star Office 6.0 will base their file formats on XML, makeing incompatability a thing of the past.  MS is sweating this, because their monopoly depends on other people needing their formats to work.  With Star Offic 6.0 you should be able to open a document in a web browser with no formatting loss for crying out loud.  I call this "productive".
<BR>

<BR>
As for virus protection, there are programs, but most times you don't need them because VIRUSES TEND TO NOT WORK IN LINUX.  There have been a couple of worms, but they are easily caught, patched, and destroyed.
<BR>

<BR>
You found flaws and shortcommings in Linux w/o even installing?  And they let you publish this?  Honestly, I hope your advertizing revenue drops off the scale; you won't be seeing me on this site any more.
<BR>

<BR>
And the thing is, there ARE shortcommings to using Linux on the average desktop, printing being the most notable; but you never even get mention the actual problems.  This article was crap.  And I just am amazed that it got posted at all.  Do us all a favor and be quiet until you use the product your are reviewing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR><cite>[editor's note, by bc] Due to enormous user feedback, we have done our best to correct some errors in this article. Hopefully it should be 100% correct now.</cite>

<BR><BR>It isn't.

<BR><BR><cite>a Finnish student coincidentally named Linux Torvalds.</cite>

<BR><BR>(1) Not a coincidence
<BR><BR>(2) His name is Linus

<BR><BR><cite>Linux Mandrake is just the latest in a long line of quirkily christened versions of Linux. </cite>

<BR><BR>No, Linux version numbers have taken purely numerical form. The examples given are <b>different companies</b> efforts to package Linux with a bunch of applications.

<BR><BR><cite>Linux is shareware</cite>

<BR><BR>No it isn't. It is published under the GPL. Shareware is commercial software that generally requires payment after a trial period expires. Linux doesn't.

<BR><BR><cite>I was shocked to learn that Linux Mandrake only runs on Pentium processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old Gateway 486 were dashed.</cite>

<BR><BR>Which is why its a good idea to read the product requirements FIRST. Other distributions of Linux will run on a 386, and still others on a Mac, and Amiga, and numerous other systems.

<BR><BR><cite>Furthermore, a whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Linux!</cite>

<BR><BR>No, to install Mandrake Linux 8.1. Other distros need smaller ammounts. I have a very happy system with 16MB of RAM and it will easily fit in to even less memory.

<BR><BR><cite>In these times when hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux.</cite>

<BR><BR>Anti-virus software IS available for Linux. However Linux is not a system which is threatened by viruses due to its high level of built in security.

<BR><BR><cite>To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall.</cite>

<BR><BR>IP Tables comes with Mandrake 8.1 and most other distros built on the 2.4 series of kernels. Older systems based on the 2.2 series use IP Chains.

<BR><BR><cite>Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs</cite>

<BR><BR>No, the cost of Windows is included in the price of most PC packages - it isn't free, and none of the machines I own came with it.

<BR><BR>I bother becuase it does everything I want it to do better then windows, more securly then windows, more convientiently then windows, and cheeper then windows.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Microsoft's pure bleak idea of internet domination will never be able to happen. There is no way that is going to happen. Microsoft's many attempts to eradicate such people pirating will never be possible, what can Microsoft do to try and dominate? It never will happen. As among Linux, one of the cheapest (yet free to download) operating software has shown one of the most greatest potentials yet in the market for Microsoft to dominate. Hence the fact that Linux out there is not battling Microsoft alone, there are many other businesses out there that will want to see Microsoft fall into somewhat smaller type business. 
<BR>
Microsoft for over the years have boasted and has stolen other people's ideas, programs, would you think that this is fair? They boasted on how good the windows operating systems are. Yet the fact is that first, the operating system costed heaps and second it wasn't powerful enough. Microsoft has tried to make it powerful and more GUI like, it has never worked out and in fact had created woes on things such as blue screen of death, pc freezing and too much stacks..
<BR>
Microsoft's products were never stable, not even the Microsoft SQL server, Last year, in windows 2000 magazine I read an article about the CEO of Oracle wants to pay someone 1 million dollars for both making the oracle website and proving that Microsoft's SQL is way better than Oracle. The outcome was when in the test, they had tried to run db server, Oracle's db software worked over the tests despite the fact that something went wrong in the cluster. The same performance was done on Microsoft's SQL server, this time the SQL server had troubles over and over again.
<BR>
Microsoft's products show the ease of easeability for new users but for much more advanced users who wants to do more, none of the Microsoft's product will ever be able to claim that they offer ease of use.
<BR>
Another fine example of this is that with programming, which in overall showed better to use.. (you decide) one is Microsoft's C++ or take visual basic, go compete that with Borland's Delphi, which is better? which is easier to use? Delphi has more GUI oriented interfaces which could allow programmers to design things with ease. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm a Linux user, without being a techie.
In 1999 I looked for some software that ran a few old programs written in Fortran for UNIX and that ran in an old 486 I had.  A friend of mine reccomended Linux and gave a copy of RedHat 6.1. There were some glitches in the install but I had an operating computer with many applications in UNIX text mode (like old DOS computers) and ran what I needed.
Later on tried to upgrade my Windows PC to Win98 and found out that it was slower than a snail so I wnet out and bought new PC with win 98.  I won't upgrade windows as it full of bugs and for what I need MS Office 97 is more than enough.

The linux computer worked great until it gave up the ghost a couple of months ago (due to a power surge).  So I decided to install Linux in my PC alongside windows, using a 2nd HDD.
I decided to try a newer version of Linux, based on the kernel 2.4.xx and downloaded RedHat 7.2 and LinuxMandrake 8.0.  
The names are not related to the version of the OS, RedHat produced 6.xx, and now is in the 7.xx family.  mandrake is in the 8.xx family using the SAME kernel as RedHat 7.xx, and many other companies are doing their own distributions.  This may sound confusing to a newbie in the computer world such as the writer of the article or the editor of this forum, but it only means that the company XXXX is making that package, pretty much what happens with computers, you buy a Dell or a Gateway or an IBM but they are all based on the same processor with more or less bells and whistles.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the installation of mandrake was fast and friendly, recognized ALL my hardware and installed a lot of programs I WANTED in my PC.  I had it running in less than 2 hours.  I installed Star Office and since then I'm using windows less and less because I have a nice Graphical Interface highly customizable, many programs I want and an FTP, HTTP server built in with firewalls.

I don't need IExplorer as Netscape, Nautilus or Opera give me better functionality.  Star Office gives me everything I had in MS Office, except fr VISIO and I have compatibility between both so I can email/receive files to everyone else.

I believe that the guy that wrote this article, besides being a newbie in the cmputer world is someone that doesn't even take time to read the installation instructions that were found in the web site of mandrake (I read them while downloading the product), so that he downloaded the wrong program and had problems in the install.  That person certainly need to inform himself better before making such negative comments of a product that myself as a non-techie user find great.
To the editor, looking for the Apache signature is not hacking or anything, it comes out when you click on no-yet built pages or broken links.  I understand you're an editor only, not a techie.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

And another thing, If you want to run Linux on a 486 try to pick a distribution that is not optimised for pentium class processors...
<BR>
I run Linux on a 386 with 4Mb ram and a 100Mb HDD. (It is the computer in the above example)
<BR>
There are other choices out there.. Redhat, Caldera, Debian, Peanut, Slackware. 
<BR>
They are not "Release Names" but diffrent flavors of the same thing, They all do the same thing they just fell diffrent.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh BTW dont forget:
<BR>
** The NSA (National Security Agency) SE Linux (Security Enhanced). **
<BR>
If it's secure enough for them I think you'll manage. NB. SE Linux is released as patches to existing programs not an entire start up bundle.
<BR>

<BR>
Then there are the BSD's, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. (These are NOT Linux but all of the same family.)

Please don't use these "hacker" tools such as "nslookup" to try and take down adequacy.&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
None of these are "hacking tools." You are making irresponsible and ignorant accusations, child.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, considering the illegality of "hacking" in many jurisdictions (that is, actually, "cracking" not "hacking" but beside the point here), your comments could be taken as libelous.
<BR>

<BR>
Making false accusations of "hacking" out your obvious ignorance of computing is foolish. You should cease immediately. And drop the threats of "legal action" given that attempting legal action when NOTHING has happened (except in your ignorant mind) could be construed as abuse of process. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you actually have lawyers (which I doubt), you should ask them what consequences there could be for YOU should you continue to make baseless accusations against others both in public and in writing.

Also, it isn't in any way illegal to make baseless accusations. If it was, then plaintiffs in criminal cases would be at risk of being taken to court themselves, if the defendant won. I can't imagine why you would think the government protects you from criticism.

Finally, your claims that these are not hacking tools are unconvincing. Every hacker claims to be using security tools, but they are still hacking, and they are still using hacker tools. Mincing words doesn't change reality.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

In the same spirit, I happen to be a successful Supreme Court justice and that trumps your corporate lawyer. So there!

<BR>
Specious analogy. The point being that you cannot obtain judgement without proving the accusation. Making a libelous statement is also nothing at all like filing a suit or charge in a court.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Finally, your claims that these are not hacking tools are unconvincing. &lt;
<BR>

<BR>
Unconvincing to the uniformed maybe. Tools with legitimate use are not defined by the illegitimate use(s). A box knife can be used as a weapon. That does NOT mean it IS a weapon.
<BR>

&gt;Every hacker claims to be using security tools, but they are still hacking, and they are still using hacker tools. Mincing words doesn't change reality.&lt;

From 'Craig McPherson' mod'ing down every one of my posts to 1 without actually engaging in the intelligent discourse this site is suppose to cater to, to the baseless accusations of hacking made by ignorant computer users, I just about had it with this site.<br>
<br>
But I can't help but respond to this post.  The tools used by lefty2446 <b>are not hacking tools</b>.<br>
<br>
The website www.netcraft.com is a public database used to track web server statistics.  Hacker tool?  I think not.  Please explain how you can construe it as such.<br>
<br>
nslookup?  It's not a hacker tool either.  It's a program that will query a DNS server for the IP address bound to a hostname.  <b>nslookup does not query or make use of adequacy.org resources</b>.  nslookup makes a request to the users DNS server, which is hosted by the user's ISP (Internet Service Provider (ie. AOL, Road Runner, Earthlink, etc.)).  Without the DNS servers in place, you would not be able to type in "www.adequacy.org" in your web browser and have this web site load up.  The translation from the domain name ("adequacy.org") to the IP address (63.89.124.239) would not be possible without DNS services.<br>
<br>
nslookup is a standard tool included with both Linux and MS systems.  Without it, I'd be hard pressed to do my job as tech support for the ISP I work for.  Before all you ingnorant MS zealots spout off with your "stop hacking us" requests, please take the time to inform youself on the topic at hand.<br>

This article is absolutely wrong. You cannot do anything to it to make it close to the reality, but to rewrite it. "Red Hat, Slack Ware," previous versions????? Wake up! RedHat, SlackWare and others are different DISTRIBUTIONS of Linux. Also RedHat for example runs on 85% of the Linux servers all over the world and is the most famous Linux distribution.  By the way is Linus Torvalds, and Linux is a registered trademark of Linus.
<BR>

<BR>
LINUX IS NOT SHAREWARE!!!!! The Gnu Public License (GPL) is a different thing. Linux is fully functional, without limitations and things like that. And may be before comparing GPL with shareware you should read the GPL and see what's the fuzz with it.(www.gnu.org/licenses.html).
<BR>
More, Linux is far less resource consuming than Windows. If you don't know, there is a project of o Linux distribution that installs on 2 floppy disks (I�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;d like to see your Windows 95 try that).
<BR>

<BR>
Try to understand the difference between a DISTRIBUTION and a version. You cannot judge the Linux OS by analyzing only one distribution that requires a Pentium compatible processor. For your information Linux runs on many processors (alpha, ia64, 
<BR>

Also, lots of Laptops are supported under Linux, for example Compaq Armada E500 and M700 are �oeRedHat Ready”. Support for Toshiba laptops exists in Linux kernel and a friend of mine just installed Linux on a Gateway 486 with no trouble.
<BR>

Internet Explorer is the industry standard web browser for Microsoft platform may be. Why IE is not on Linux, perhaps  you should ask the Microsoft guys about this. IE was one advantage of Windows platforms, but not any more. The last release of Netscape 6.1 is far better than IE. The same situation is with Microsoft Office. My opinion is that they are afraid of porting those application to Linux, because no one would pay 200$ for a license of Windows XP anymore. They would choose a far stable and secure operating system, which is Linux. 
<BR>

<BR>
Have you ever heard about SUN�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;s StarOffice? It is the office suite from SUN. It�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;s a complete solution for office applications and I wouldn�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;t consider it �oepitiful”. I don�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;t need to say more about this subject, if you never heard about it maybe you shouldn�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;t write about this subject.
<BR>

<BR>
Computer security was not overlooked by Linux developers. A very good firewall is integrated into the Linux kernel, and there are many commercial firewalls out there. 
<BR>

<BR>
Antivirus software? What for? There are no viruses for Linux!!!! Of course there are Antivirus software that work on Linux, but those give protection about Windows viruses. (i.e. you have a Linux file server for Windows machines).
<BR>
�oeMicrosoft Windows comes free”????????? Where did that come from? You pay for every license of Windows that you buy. 
<BR>

<BR>
Concluding, could you publish your bank account status and your IQ, so that one can see how reliable is this article?
<BR>

<BR>
Please rewrite this article or just take it out, it�&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;s absolutely not real.

<BR>

<BR>
and by the way - i dont use linux - although i have in the past - i need windows for certain tasks i do 
<BR>

<BR>
a few facts: 
<BR>

<BR>
mandrake is a company that distributes linux - like microsoft is company - redhat etc are all different companies
<BR>

<BR>
windows xp requires at least 64 megs to run and i wouldnt even think of installing on a 486 - in fact the best thing u can do with a 486 these days is throw it in a bin or use it as a dos box
<BR>

<BR>
IIS is terrible - i am a professional web developer and i wouldnt recommend using IIS for anything - linux makes far better servers - and much more secure - you will also find that hackers use linux as it is a much more advanced operating system - even M$ used linux apache servers for about 5 years to host their websites!
<BR>

<BR>
mandrake has at least 1 firewall built in to it - its not a games machine its a pc users machine - 
<BR>

<BR>
IE is not on linux cos M$ havent released a version!
<BR>

<BR>
im sure there is some anti-software available - but since you couldnt even be bothered to install it you wont find any will u?
<BR>

<BR>
actually u will find that Netscape 6.1 and mozilla run fine on linux - although i admit i prefer IE
<BR>

<BR>
of course windows software wont natively work on linux - they use different setups! its like saying ooh my video recorder wont play cds!
<BR>

<BR>
to be honest i am amazed that someone with such a little amount of knowledge in this area is allowed to write a review of this nature

2.)  You know why Linux doesn't need virus scanning programs?  Because of the way Linux is designed.  As long as you don't use the root account ALL THE TIME (which nobody ever should - you should create a seperate account for your daily work) there is no way a virus can infect an entire system.  File permissions will stop that (unlike Windows).  Secondly - how many virii have you heard about that infect Linux computers?  Very few, if any.  That's right.  Virii programmers want to make a splash in the news, so they program for the operating system that will give them that fame.  EX:  Windows


<BR>



<BR>
3.)  Who cares if you can't run "all the programs" under Linux.  First off, if there's a program for it in Windows, Linux has something similar.  Secondly, Linux programs are FREE.  That is correct.  You won't find an owner of Linux paying 600 dollars for a program that they'll use to type up a letter to mom at home.  Third, if a Linux user REALLY wants to run Microsoft programs under Linux - that's what we have Windows emulators for.


<BR>



<BR>
4.)  You don't need 32 megs of RAM to run Linux.  You need RAM to run KDE/Gnome.  However, have you checked your RAM count when you are under Windows.  I don't know about you, but, mine's used up almost completely.  Windows ALWAYS has to dip into my "virtual memory" (the equivalent of a SWAP file in Linux).  Linux, on the other hand, has to run for about 3 days before I even touch the swap file.  And, if you don't need a graphical interface, then, you need almost no RAM whatsoever.


<BR>



<BR>
5.)  What's this about Mandrake not being able to run under your 486?  You think Windows XP is going to do that?  HA!  You need 256 MB of RAM and at least 1 Gig on your hard drive JUST FOR WINDOWS XP!  (Don't tell me I don't know.  I sell it.)  32 Megs pales in comparison to that.  And...I have two full Linux discs installed on my computer and I am only using 800 megs.  (That's applications and EVERYTHING.)


<BR>


<BR>
6.)  "...wasting their time and money on Linux..." - What money?  I didn't pay any money...Linux is free.  Or did you forget that from the beginning of your article to the time that you got to the end?

<BR>



<BR>



<BR>
...so...before you go busting on Linux's ass...you should review your facts and not be a blind reporter with a bias on something you haven't even looked at.  I will say that Windows is very good in its hardware compatability, and it does have some nice programs and GREAT gaming support (which is why it is still on my system).  However, Linux has power and usability that Windows will never have.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Now, on to the nitpicking.
<BR>

<BR>
First, and nearly irrelevant:
<BR>
It's Linus Torvald, not Linux Torvald.
<BR>

<BR>
Second:  
<BR>
If you couldn't get Mandrake to run on your machine, why didn't you try another distribution?  I've seen Slackware running on a 386 with 8 megs of ram.  Sure, it took a REALLY long time to compile, but it worked.
<BR>

<BR>
Third:
<BR>
Viruses.  Apparently, you're grossly uninformed about this.  The only way to get a virus on a linux box is to be an idiot.  You can't install anything that would even have the potential to mess up your system unless you're running as root. And, as previously stated, if you run everything as root, you're an idiot.  That's what multi-user is for.  There is no need for antivirus software on linux because THERE ARE NO VIRUSES for linux.  Do you drink a bottle of NyQuil if you aren't sick? (Or at least Dennis Leary)
<BR>

<BR>
Fourth:
<BR>
The browser.  The reason there isn't an Internet Exploiter for linux is that Microsoft won't allow it.  They rule their sourcecode with an iron fist, which means that none of the open-source developers can get their hands on it.  Try Opera, or if you must go with something familiar from Windoze, go with Netscape.
<BR>

<BR>
Fifth:
<BR>
ZoneAlarm.  You don't need this.  Linux only allows access to the ports that you tell it to (unless you just click your way through the installation blindly).  And, if you're going to have firewall software, and you have an x86 lying around, why not make that into a firewall.  It's free, doesn't take too long to set up if you've got a good head on your shoulders, and oh yeah, it's free.
<BR>

<BR>
Sixth:
<BR>
Your assertion that "there simply isn't a need to replace" Windows is entirely laughable.  Windows needs to be reinstalled, upgraded, etc, at least once every few months if you don't want your P4 running like that 486 you've got. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now, for my points.  How long does your precious Win95 box stay up before you have to reboot?  A week?  Two?  If so, you're an expert windows user. My linux box has been up for 115 days, 4 hours, 31 minutes.  The last reboot was due to a power outage.
<BR>

<BR>
Have you ever heard of StarOffice?  It's an office-like suite that has full support of M$Office files.  It's also *gasp* free.  You don't have to pay 200 bucks to upgrade every time you turn around.  It's also got a pretty spiffy email client built-in.  Granted, I use pine for email, but if I were into the whole GUI-email thing, this would be more than sufficient.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, the bloatware issue.  If you want to turn something off in Windoze, chances are, you're out of luck.  In linux, it's easy as pie.
<BR>

<BR>
And just think, this entire response was based strictly on the comments you made.  I am not even going to go into the plethora of other useful things you can do in linux that you wouldn't even think possible under windows.
<BR>

<BR>
A tip for the future:  Next time you plan on bashing something, read a bit about it before you open your mouth and make a fool out of yourself.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

1. BSD is NOT based on SUN's OS, SUN's OS is based on BSD. Get it right.

2. Mandrake is specifically designed to run on Pentium and up. If you wanted to run Linux on a 486, many other distros could have done it. Do your homework.

3. Of course Microsoft Office, Outlook express and Internet Explorer don't run on it. Duh. If Microsoft ported those apps to Linux, a lot more people would quit using MS Windows.
<BR>
4. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is NOT trying to make Internet Explorer a standard. That is an outright lie. A really stupid one as it shows how little this author understands about the purpose of the IETF. They set standards on protocols not on which product you use.
<BR>
5. The TOS of adequacy.org says trolling will not be tolerated, but this whole article is one big troll.
<BR>
6. Linux is the most standards compliant OS there is. To argue otherwise just shows how little you understand standards.
<BR>
7. Windows does not come 'free' with every PC. You pay for it, it is just included in the price. Get some cahones and build your own system. Then Linux is definitely the cheaper way to go.
<BR>
8. The whole thread on hacking has sunk my view of the average computer use to new lows. Anyone who argues that telnetting to port 80 is hacking has.. is just ... oh god help us.

<BR>
As a security engineer on the Web Security Team of a major financial institution ( and one of the leaders in e-commerce) I can say that very few of the people posting claiming that wget, lynx or telnet are hacker tools could find their /proc with both hands.
<BR>

<BR>
Here is an idea, actually know something before posting.

Next thing you know, they will be claiming that doing Start-&gt;Run-&gt;telnet is accessing executables without permission. If MS had intended you to use telnet, they would have put it on a menu.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

How do you manage to get through a complete day without help? Are you actually trusted enough with sharp objects like pencils or do they give you crayons to work with?

Look at following bit of tripe from your fingertips....

<BR>
"It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux."
<BR>

<BR>
Holy Crap! Did you just step out of the Microsoft Waaay Back machine? Do the words monopoly, anti-trust, Sherman Act etc have any current meaning to you? Go ask Uncle Bill why his crappy shitware doesn't run in Linux.
<BR>
Heres another gem....
<BR>

<BR>
"Linux is shareware"
<BR>

<BR>
Do you even know what "shareware" is or were you just discovering the Play Station 2 when you heard the term junior?

Just noticed this on the "Post a Comment" page:
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Trolling is not tolerated here. Any comment may be &gt;deleted by a site admin, and all trolls will be &gt;deleted. This is your fair warning.
<BR>

<BR>
What the &lt;&gt;?&gt;&lt; are all the "associate editors" posts other than trolls?
<BR>

<BR>
Now...on to the main matter:
<BR>

<BR>
Telnet is a handy tool for remotely accessing other systems over a network (intra or inter).
<BR>

<BR>
Like all tools and knowledge it has NO ETHICAL LEANING. knowledeg and tools are NEUTRAL. 
<BR>

<BR>
A box cutter is a useful tool for opening boxes. It can also be used as a weapon, yet in fact it is the PERSON WIELDING THE BOXCUTTER that determines it use, not the tool (which is a bit of metal and plastic). 
<BR>

<BR>
Partical physics is real useful for understanding the universe, but it can be perverted by PEOPLE to   be a tool for mass destrcution.
<BR>

<BR>
Get the point??? Likewise TELNET is a neutral TOOL that is innocent when wielded by an innocent person for innocent purposes.
<BR>

<BR>
That it was used to make you (adequacy.org) look like hypocrits is unfortunate for you,as it showed your INADEQUATE understanding of web and system security. But again...telenet is just a tool.

<BR>

<BR>
1. Shareware? NO! Certainly not! Linux is free, and not only free, you can see the source code and change it if you feel inclined. Not a major advantage for the average user, but the comment that is shareware is wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
2. "a whopping 32MB of memory". Whopping? And then you say that you run Win95 on 32MB of memory. How many crashes do you get a day? How productive is this Win95 system? A 486/32MB RAM Win95 system is for all intents and purposes not a very productive day-to-day machine. Sure it boots up. Sure you can run stuff on. Sure it gets the job done. But the (now tiny) investment into a new machine will buy you huge amounts of productivity. Trying to test a state-of-the-art latest-version OS on a such old technology is bad practice. I want you to test Windows XP on this 486 with a whopping 32MB of RAM machine of yours. Very bad.
<BR>

<BR>
I stopped reading after spotting these blatent signs of bad journalism.
<BR>

<BR>
And for the record, I am a very happy Windows 2000 user. I am dabbling with installing Linux just because I may be forced to use the OS in the very near future for in my work, and so learning it now will probably not hurt. But such a bad article should not be let go.

If it's free, then why is mandrake charging $$$ for it?  Paying money for something you ought to get for free is the essence of shareware.

When was the last time you priced memory?  The marginal cost on ram more than 32MB is prohibitive.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm an avid user and supporter of both Linux and Windows. This puts me at odds with the more militant members in both groups. I was interested in reading this article--especially since the editor's note implied that a serious effort was being made to make a fair, accurate article.
<BR>

<BR>
I have been very dissapointed. The author clearly knows nothing about Linux--and appears to have only a dim idea on how compters work.
<BR>

<BR>
And it's still packed full of inaccurate statements.
<BR>

<BR>
First, the man's name is Linus not Linux. The software name (Linux) is a combination of his name and Unix. Linux is a Unix-like operating system.
<BR>

<BR>
Second, Red Hat is not a previous version of Linux. It is a different distribution. Distributions are kind of like flavors of ice cream. You can go into an ice cream parlor and pick out the flavor that best suits your tastes. 
<BR>

<BR>
Each distribution packages the kernel (the core operating system) with a wide variety of support software and applications. Different distributions target different markets. Mandrake and Red Hat are very similar--but Mandrake tends to focus on desktop users, while Red Hat focuses more on servers.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux does not require a pentium with 32 Megs of RAM. Those are Mandrake's requirements. There are several distributions that will run just fine on a 486. Also, unlike Windows, you can also run Linux on a wide variety of hardware--including the Mac.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is not shareware. Shareware is software that you can try out before paying for it. When you use shareware, you're still expected to pay.
<BR>

<BR>
Technically Linux is Open Source. Open Source is superficially like freeware--but it goes much beyond that. In Open Source, you're allowed to look at, study, modify or reuse the actual source code of each and every program. It provides an environment of sharing, peer review and cooperation that produces very creative, high quality software.
<BR>

<BR>
As for software, the author seems to be completely ignorant about how operating systems work. Windows and Linux are different operating systems--you cannot (and should not) expect them to run the same software.
<BR>

<BR>
Think of it this way, if I bought a brand new Mac and then tried to run my Windows Office or Windows games, everyone would laugh at me. 
<BR>

<BR>
Of course, Microsoft has released its office software and Internet Explorer for the Mac. But, Microsoft has decided not to release its software for Linux. No surprise, really. Microsoft is strongly opposing Linux at the moment.
<BR>

<BR>
But other companies, like Corel, have released Linux versions of their software. And Linux, being a Unix-like operating system, has inherited tons of applications from Unix. And Linux has a massive amount of its own software.
<BR>

<BR>
There are Linux web browsers, and the people who are writing the browsers work very hard to make them fully compliant with the W3C standards (the official standards for the world wide web). There are several different word processors, spreadsheets, graphic design programs. 
<BR>

<BR>
Compairing the software is hard. Windows software tends to have a better user interface. They also tend to have more features--which can be good or bad.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux software tends to be a collection of smaller, more powerful applications. Linux often gives you the tools to easily do things that are very difficult (or impossible) in Windows--but it usually isn't as user friendly. Some of the most powerful, and fastest, software runs from the command line, and has no graphical interface whatsoever. There are a lot of applications with graphical interfaces (or applications that act as a graphical interface for the underlying software), but the interfaces are not quite up to Windows standards yet. But it's getting better every day.
<BR>

<BR>
If you plan to use Linux, expect to spend some time reading books and on-line documentation. There's a vary steep learning curve, but it is very rewarding.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux has a much-more secure design than Windows. Virus prevention is focused on keeping the system secure, so viruses never gain a foothold, rather than just scanning for a list of known offenders.
<BR>

<BR>
Furthermore, most of the viruses out there only affect Windows systems. Sir Cam, I Love You, Anna K.--These cannot affect a Linux system.
<BR>

<BR>
Likewise, while Windows personal firewalls won't run on Linux, there are equivilant systems that can be used to protect your system. Mandrake has a few options for setting up very-secure personal firewalls.
<BR>

<BR>
But, like Linux applications, if you really want to make your system secure, you need to spend some time and do some studying.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows 95/98/Me is pretty secure, just because it was designed to be an isolated system. In many ways, it's too stupid to be dangerous. By limiting the ability to remotely access the computer's resoruces, you limit the damage a hacker can do (but don't be too relaxed, any software downloaded from the internet can hold codes that will give hackers access to your system).
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is more like Windows NT or 2000. Like other versions of Unix (and Unix is the backbone of the internet), Linux allows multiple computers to connect and work together in very powerful ways.
<BR>

<BR>
But this power comes at a cost. You need to make sure that no one is abusing the services you provide, using them to gain unauthorized access to your system.
<BR>

<BR>
All three (Linux, WinNT/200 and other Unixes) all require a good deal of study, training and dedication to secure.
<BR>

<BR>
But most experts agree that Linux is more secure than WinNT/2000. Anyone heard of Code Red or Nimda? These only affected Windows machines.
<BR>

<BR>
And, the NSA (that's the National Security Agency) has released Secure Linux. Not really a full distribution, this is an add-on that can be used with Red Hat and other distributions. It's not a finished project yet--but it is the first steps in creating a system whose security is far beyond any existing systems.
<BR>

<BR>
So, editors, if you want to print an article about Linux that would be useful to your Windows readers--please find an author who understands both worlds. And please, if you do print an article, work a bit harder to get it right.
<BR>

<BR>
You're not at 100% yet. Maybe 40%. And that's being generous.

Actually, I could even overlook the lack of reasonably well-functioning productivity suites if someone on the Linux side could come up with a decent web browser.  Mozilla sucks, Nautilus sucks, Opera sucks, Netscape TOTALLY blows dogs.  It's amazing that the same development community that came up with Apache and PHP can't do more to make the client side at least not excruciating.

Anyway, let's start witht he name Linus Torvalds... You got it wrong twice!  It would take two seconds to go to one of the hundreds of linux sites on the net today, and get the guys name right.  Damn that is bad.
<BR>

<BR>
The thing that annoys me the most about this post is that you keep calling mandrake-linux's downfalls, linux's downfalls... They are not one in the same.  Linux is a very small part of Mandrake-Linux...  The majority of Mandrake-Linux is 3rd party software.  Linux is basically just the kernel part of the OS.
<BR>

<BR>
"Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95, it seems that Linux requires far more powerful, and more expensive, computer hardware. Is this really the sign of a lean, mean operating system? Of course not."
<BR>

<BR>
There are SO many things wrong with this statement.  For starters, your humble 486 will not "happily" run Windows 95.  It would be a bit on the slow side.  But let's put things in perspective here, you say that the battle will be between Linux-Mandrake 8.1 and Windows XP.  This is a totally stupid comment in and of itself, but I will continue anyway.  Why don't you try to run Windows XP on your humble 486 and see how far that gets you.  Actually scratch that, try running Windows 2000 on your 486 and see how far you get.  Linux is a lean, mean operating system!  You can run linux off a floppy drive on a 386 with 2 megs of RAM (do that with your windows 95).  You just can't run Mandrake-Linux that way.  Linux-Mandrake isn't made to be lean, it is made to be rich in powerful software.  Linux-Mandrake is leaner and meaner than any MS OS though, IMO.  Linux is not only lean and mean, but versitile.  I can run linux on my SUN spac classic, my old macs, my SGI indy, and my tadpole 3gx.  You can't do that with windows XP/2000/NT/ME/98/95/3.11/3.1/3.0/2.0/1.0/MS-DOS, but why would you care, you don't even know what I am talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
"why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?"
<BR>

<BR>
well... because us linux users use the browser that set the standards... a little proggy called mozilla (mozzila.org).  Mozilla is the only browser that follows all the internet standards.  I know you probably haven't heard of it, but it is the code that Netscape was based on... Mozilla has gone off on its own and has passed netscape by leaps and bounds.  If aol didn't run netscape into the ground, I am sure that it would still be the #1 browser.  We also have other options and great browsers like opera, netscape, and konqueror.  I enjoy using mozilla, and for the record it is possible to run internet explorer under linux, just not desirable with all the other great choices.  The reason why you don't see ie packaged with linux is because Micro$oft doesn't license it out to OSes that compete with windows on x86 based computers.

"Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software is completely incompatible with Linux! It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux. Those who wish to use their computer for recreational purposes are also out of luck, for almost all of the most popular games are unavailable for Linux. Although a wide range of software is freely available for Linux, these pitiful offerings are mostly unfinished, unreliable and do not bear comparison to their commercial counterparts."
<BR>

<BR>
This is not nearly true... There are various emulators for linux that allow you to run any windows apps under linux.  Let me give you a few: WINE, win4lin, and VMware.  There are also good replacements for various windows software.  For MS Office we have star office.  It is completely free, and can be used to save/open in MS Office format.  You can read and edit any of your MS Office apps under Star Office.  There are various mail apps to replace Outlook... Besides, using Outlook in this day and age isn't the smartest thing anyway.  It is true that the game support for linux leaves something to be desired.  Currently many game developers are making a version of their games for linux.  With future development on the WINE projects it will someday be possible to run all your old windows games under linux.  I can't really comment on how soon this will be.  A VERY large range of FREE software is available.  Just checkout freshmeat.net.  Loads of excellent software.  I don't know how you can call them pitiful offerings, or really make any comments on them if you can't even get past the install of the OS.  I think your offerings to this site are pitiful!  Get a clue.

"Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by the developers of Linux. In these times when hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux. To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Linux, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet."
<BR>

<BR>
For starters, I don't want to hear a guy talking about security that can't even install Mandrake-Linux.  If I were you, I wouldn't go there.  I am a security expert, and windows can't touch what linux has in the way of security.  Compare the number of virii under windows to the number under linux (from that perspective, linux is currently infanitely more secure than windows this is 100% fact).  Compare the number of Apache worms to the number of IIS worms (again infanitely more secure).  There is anti-virus software for linux, but guess what!?!?!?!  we don't need it.  There aren't any virii written for linux!  You know why?!?!?  Because, linux doesn't have the same security flaws that windows does... A conventional virus is rendered useless under linux because it doesn't get permission to do the things it does under windows, under linux.  Smart right?  Yippie!  ZoneAlarm firewall?  Give me a break... If you want a real firewall, set up a linux box between your workstation(s) and the internet running a real firewall on it.  Stupid windows firewalls that run on your local box present a false sence of security.  Infact, Mandrake comes with one all set up for you, and you can easily configure it from mandrake's sytem config.  If you actually installed the software you are criticizing you would know that, and various other things.
<BR>

<BR>
Well, I have exposed enough flaws in you.  Let me finish up here.
<BR>

<BR>
I have been using linux since I was 13 years old (9 years ago).  I have seen how far it has come, and am impressed.  I did MCSE type work in high school, and for a few years after.  Guess where I ended up professionally?  With linux.  Why?  Cause I like it better.  Most MCSE style people I know end up on the linux side (if they know what is best for them j/k).  =)  I am not here to bash Windows and praise linux.  I just wanted a somewhat true story to be told.  I am sure that even you windows users can see that he is full of it.  I have never been to this site, and will probably never be back again.
<BR>

<BR>
I am not trying to convince anyone to swith OSes or anything like that.  Just use what you know/like the best.  If you want to try linux, there are various ditros out there besides Mandrake, and they all have specific applications.  I don't feel the real battle will be between Mandrake-Linux and Windows XP.  I don't know that Linux is ready for all desktops quite yet.  Most of the people that use computers are as clueless as the writer of this article, and can't really handle it.  If you run an office and have linux experts on staff, then you might have a shot at converting your once windows users to comfortable linux users.  The bottom line is, your "average" PC user is probably not going to like linux the first time they try it.  ESPECIALLY if they are one of those Windows rules everything else sucks, I can't think outside of the box, close minded fools.
<BR>

<BR>
As far as servers go, anyone that has been to a real data center (global center, exodus, globix) and looked at servers, knows that Windows is no were near where Linux/Unix is.  One of the last networks I worked on is in New Jersey's Exodus.  I used 100+ linux boxes and 2 large True64 UNIX boxes for database.  Number of windows boxes: 0.  What was the outcome?  Only one of the fastest computer networks in the world.  We were the fastest system for delivering e-mail.  We also served web pages faster than almost anyone.  Would this have been possible using windows with IIS and exchange?  Not even close. They are a NYC based company with the urls www.netcreations.com and www.postmasterdirect.com.  Chances are you have recieved e-mail from one of their servers if you were ever on a mailing list.
<BR>

<BR>
I personally feel that Mandrake-Linux is the *best* desktop OS I have ever used. As we speak I am rebooting from upgrading to 8.1. I would not personally use it as a server OS, because of all the fluff, but it is so easy and nice for the desktop.  It comes with so much great software and configure tools.  For server OSes I would check out Redhat (redhat.com) and Debian (debian.org) Linux as well as FreeBSD (freebsd.org) and NetBSD (netbsd.org).  There are various other news sources where you can get better info about linux. Check out osdn.org, linux.org, kernel.org, even cnet.com.  Anything would be better than this place.

And Slashcode got its idea from Usenet and from BBS software that has been around since the 1980s (although you're too young to remember any of this, and too indoctrinated by the open source movement's lies to believe it anyway). Although you seem to be Slashdot's greatest disciple and apologist, you'll have to take my word for it when I say that there's <b>nothing</b> novel about Slashcode.<BR><BR>
<i>that is the beauty of opensource...</i><BR><BR>
That's bullshit, and you know it. Ultimate Bulletin Board (UBB) has the functionality of Slashcode, and predates Slashcode by several years, so by your logic I have proved that proprietary software is infinitely superior to open source. Thanks for playing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Not that it matters though... I know lots about BBS's and similar things.

how much actual code did slashcode borrow from BBS systems?  zero... but many of the slashcode clones borrowed much of the code from slashcode... that is my point... I'm sure IF scoop even existed without slashcode, it wouldn't be anything like it is now.  Not that it would be worse, just different...

By trade I am a systems administrator to an exclusively Microsoft network, but I just can't let such a foul heap of mis-information as this slide by.

<BR>

<BR>
First off, isn;t it Linus Trovalds, not Linux.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
-------------------------------------------------
<BR>
"  .. . reveals that Linux is sorely lacking many crucial productivity applications"
<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>
This is not true.
<BR>

<BR>
StarOffice is a high quality office suite completely compatible with MSOffice.  Free from Sun.com.  Actually I have heard reports of Star Office being able to open corrupted Word documents that Word refuses to open.  In some ways it's a better Office than MSOffice.
<BR>

<BR>
GIMP is a proffesional free image manipulation program often compared to Adobe-photoshop
<BR>

<BR>
Blender is a really free cool 3D-manipulation program with many advanced features that runs neck and neck with the super-expensive 3D studio Max.
<BR>

<BR>
I'll admit there are a lot of garbage apps, but there are some really good one's as well.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
--------------------------------------------
<BR>
"Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software is completely incompatible with Linux! "
<BR>
--------------------------------------------
<BR>

<BR>
As a matter of fact all these programs are available on windows, linux (and other OS's as well).  They just one crash as often on Linux as they would in windows.
<BR>

<BR>
I was hoping to find an informed review of the new Mandrake 8.1, this guy really needs to do more research before he goes bashing stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>
To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Linux, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet.
<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<BR>
Woah.  And Windows is known for great security!  I know from experience that a Microsoft System is about as leak-proof as swiss cheese.  Plus there ARE firewalls available for Linux.  As a matter of fact I believe most Distros come with a couple with the installation disks.
<BR>

<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>
I recommend that those Adequacy readers who are hoping to upgrade their operating system patiently wait for the release of Windows XP, rather than foolishly wasting their time, effort and money on Linux.
<BR>
------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<BR>
Wait a second, 
<BR>

<BR>
1. Remember Linux is free.
<BR>

<BR>
2. An unstable Windows system that crashes continuously and must be constantly patched to avoid violation is not my idea of well spent time and effort.
<BR>

<BR>
So Adequacy is 'News for Grown Ups'?  Where were they when this article was written?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Well, I guess anyone can tell by now that you are (at most) but a simple computer user that can't turn on the power unless it reads "POWER".
<BR>

<BR>
First of all: the name is Linus Torvalds (with an S).
<BR>

<BR>
And I will not even bother quoting everything, because there is not a single memorable statement in your review. Try studying some computer science before saying such bullshit.
<BR>

<BR>
btw... Linux DOES NOT NEED antiviruses... ever heard of an antivirus for Irix? Solaris? don't think so. Ant that's exactly what Linux is: an UNIX-like os. Not the windows-mess.
<BR>

<BR>
and Mandrake, Slackware, Redhat are not linux VERSIONS, but DISTRIBUTIONS. Anyway, you can choose not to use either, and go build linux from scratch by yourself.
<BR>

<BR>
...and talking about "why bother"...
<BR>
maybe it's just a coincidence that the biggest servers on the internet running on PCs are not NT... always Linux, FreeBSD, and alike. Coincidence? I guess not.
<BR>

<BR>
So, the next time you get a "your program performed an llegal operation" error, remember this: TRY LINUX. But for heavens sake... go learn something about computers first, moron.<BR>

You aren't too terribly bright for an author are you?
<BR>

<BR>
You're 'article' looks like it was written in 10 minutes by someone who has never been exposed to the topic that is being written about, but picked up an article off the net written by someone who is a supporter of a competing product. 
<BR>

<BR>
You then declared yourself qualified to write an article about the product based on this article.
<BR>

<BR>
The Internet is an amazing tool.  It's too bad its soiled with content written by individuals like yourself.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, BTW...   I happen to use several operating systems and have no axe to grind with any of them.   I have Mac, Win98SE, Win2K Professional, Linux Mandrake 7.2, and Mandrake 8.0.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Ok. I can understand you having some problems with Linux. It is not for everyone, and I don't expect the world to convert tomorrow. However, Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, not Linux Torvalds. The "x" at the end is to reveal that it is a clone of UNIX. Also, your article makes it sound like Mandrake is the latest in a line of Linux versions. Mandrake is just one distribution of the Linux operating system. The others you mentioned (Red Hat, Suse, Debian, Slackware) are other distributions. They are all based on the Linux kernel and utilize many of the same utilities. Mandrake's distribution is optimized for Pentium class processors. This is not a shortcoming of Linux. This just happens to be the market that Mandrake is targeting. The memory requirements are also Mandrake-specific, not Linux-specific. You can run Linux with skimpier hardware (Yes, it will run on your old 486, but not Mandrake Linux.). No, Internet Explorer is not available for Linux, but since when is it the industry standard as you claim. Netscape Navigator 4.78 is included with Mandrake 8.1. Also included are Mozilla 0.94, Konqueror 2.2.1, and Galeon (version number escapes me). No, Microsoft Office is not on Linux, but there are other alternatives that are excellent for 80% of office productivity needs. KOffice is an integrated office suite that is included with KDE. Star Office is another integrated office suite from Sun Microsystems that can be freely downloaded and installed on Linux, and it can read and write MS Office file formats. No, you probably cannot go down to your local software store and buy the latest game for the Linux platform. However, Mandrake 8.1 comes with LOADS of very cool games that will keep you plenty distracted, and if you have a graphics card that is supported for 3D acceleration, there are even some very nice 3D games included. If you want more, then there is a company called Loki Software that ports games to the Linux platform. I have their version of Rune, and it rocks. You can check them out at http://www.lokigames.com. As to the issue of virus software, there are virus checkers out there for Linux, but you really do not need one. Why? Well, there are only about 8 viruses that affect the Linux platform as opposed to the over 50,000 viruses that could bite you on Windows. Now, if you're still worried about those 8, they cannot destroy your system as long as you do not browse the Internet or check e-mail as the root user. These are activities that should be done when logged into your user account. If you do get infected by a virus, the worst it can do is wipe out your /home/user directory. Just keep that backed up and you can always restore that. The important stuff is unreachable unless you are logged in as root. As for firewalls, Mandrake 8.1 does come with a firewall that you can configure. No, it's not called ZoneAlarm, but it is a working firewall. So, based on this new information, I sincerely hope that you will give Mandrake, or some other distribution of Linux, another try. I suggest you do some reading at a site that goes over the steps to install Linux. You might want to try Red Hat (http://www.redhat.com). Their distro is very good, and it should run on your 486 hardware.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Let's start with the most obvious points:
<BR>

<BR>
1. Linux is NOT Shareware - it is Open Source / Free Software. So are most, if not all, the various Linux distributions (compilations of Linux with many tools and applications ready to install).
<BR>

<BR>
2. Linux can run on anything from wristwatches and PDAs, to mainframes. Linux supports dozens of different processors (486 included), and with as little as 2MB of RAM (probably even less).
<BR>

<BR>
3. Internet Explorer is not an IETF standard, rather it is the most outstanding example of a browser that repeatedly fails to conform to published standards (not to mention security). That browser happens to be a Microsoft product - see note 5 below why it won't run on Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Most standards relevant to browsers are published by the W3C (WWW consotium), not by the IETF.
<BR>

<BR>
5. The "popular applications" that are not available on Linux are Microsoft products. Microsoft refuses to port their applications to Linux, because they know it will accelerate even further the migration from MS's Operating Systems to Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
6. There is anti-virus software for Linux, but there's no demand for such software because there is hardly (if any) virus that compromises Linux systems. Linux has it's origin in Unix, which is by design more secure and more robust than Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Linux has a built-in strong Firewall, that's only rivaled by full scale products such as CheckPoint's FW-1. The "personal" firewalls available for Windows desktops are no match for the standard Linux firewall capabilities.
<BR>

<BR>
I guess if I could force myself to read the article again I'd find plenty more statements that have nothing to do with facts.
<BR>

<BR>
I wonder if the author did any thinking, let alone basic research, before writing the article. I don't even use Linux and I know better than him, and he's supposed to write an article...
<BR>

<BR>
It seems the author  and the editor need to learn some basics Internet Explorer an IETF standard? You can't be more wrong!)

1 - XP requires a P3 and 128MB RAM, Mandrake requires a P1 and 32MB <b>for a graphical installer</b> - Mandrake wins that stupid argument.
2 - There are many flavours of Linux which will run on systems that even W95 chokes on.
3 - "why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux?" because it's owned by Microsoft? Are you really this stupid? Why can't you buy Pepsi in Coke machines? Damn, I am amazed that you can be this moronic. BTW, Netscape has about 50% of the browser market still "industry standard" my pink butt.
4 - "By refusing to adhere to recognised standards, Linux is simply undermining its own credibility.
" - Both Netscape and Mozilla comply with all W3 standards, which IE does not. 
5- "it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux." - show me a Linux virus that you can get onto my system. You can't, because with Linux being open sourced it means all flaws can be found and fixed immediately by thousands of expert programmers, unlike the closed and buggy MS system. I will bet your entire fortune against mine that not even 0.1% of virii out there are able to attack a Linux based system.

6- "Without even installing Linux Mandrake" enough said really. How can you review something you haven't even tried. You are a joke of a reviewer.

7-"After all, Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs" - it does not and never has. Microsoft charge a fee for exery OEM copy that is sold, which btw entitles you to <b>zero support from MS</b> even tho they are the ones charging you around $75 per win98/ME and $150 per w2k. I sell PCs, so I know this for a fact.

8 - "wait for the release of Windows XP, rather than foolishly wasting their time, effort and money on Linux." - you are amazing. Linux is <b>FREE</b>, you even say so yourself.

9 - I bet you wont post this reply.

10- to the ppl who should read this. Ignore this moron's :cough:review:cough:, try Mandrake Linux for FREE, if you dont like it, then delete it.

Good day people,
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who wrote the article has, tactfully put, numerous errors as has been pointed out in the numerous replies. This reply wont even try correct them because if the readers aren't yet convinced with the facts laid out then nothing will.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reply is a plea to all those 'evil, corrupt, and apostles-of-the-demon' linux users that have been plaguing this 'very informative and fact-filled' article (some may replace it with website but that doesnt concern me). EVIL LINUX USERS, stop leading this 'GOOD PEOPLE OF MICROSOFT' into your ways! Haven't you noticed that you are all agitating them? Have you not the common sense to feel that you are shattering what sense of normalcy these people have? This site provides an outlet for their frustrations and gives them a sense of accomplishment by publishing what is on their mind on this part of the web, no matter how twisted some may be read and interpreted.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what if you dont find this article and site informative? These people need these kind of sites. It's that plain and simple. These people have been contented with what was given to them and anything that we, yes I am a Linux user too and a Mandrake user at that, say will only be treated as heresy. This is their part of the world, no matter how twisted it may look to us. Intelligent people, from both sides of the fence, have given meaningful insights but it all boils down to a flame match. In order for an argument to have a meaningful outcome both sides should be open to the idea that they may be wrong. It does not hurt if both parties can see the other side of the argument.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All generalizations are dangerous, even this one. I have encountered that saying countless of times. Most Windows users generalize Linux users as barbaric, juvenile delinquents who are burdens of modern society. Some veteran *nix user view window's users as non-technical people (the extremist even think of them as idiots or immature users) who are contented with a scrap of faulty code. I am from both but what does that make me?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux is not for all. We can advocate but we cannot force people to use something that they are not comfortable with. Three years ago I was afraid of touching anything related or similar to Unix because I was uninformed and there was no need to learn anything beyond what Microsoft has to offer. When I was employed I was amazed at what Unix has to offer but did not gobble it up in one fell swoop. As I hunger for knowledge I consumed information a little bit at a time. This is what differentiates Windows users from *nix users, the passion for knowledge. I know many Windows users that have the same passion but they are just a handful. We can all rant about stability, superiority, efficiency of our favorite OS. That is called freedom of speech. We can all install whatever software we can on OUR computers. That is called freedom of choice.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I saying? Honestly I dont know. I am gnashing my teeth at the 'inconsistencies' that was posted and the 'intentional' blindness of some posters from the facts presented. On the other hand I am grateful because some brilliant minds has surfaced and offered some information that really interests me, and I am not talking about the 'hacking' stuff that site proponents are crying wolf about because that is something that people with common sense should figure out by themselves. I think I should be preparing my conclusion now for this is becoming a long post.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONCLUSION: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Windows users, nobody is forcing you to use Linux. When the author tried to 'review' Mandrake Linux, he was posting a technical article. But he was trying to hide behind the facade that he is doing it from the average person's point of view instead of facing the fact that he is not technologically capable of rendering the review some semblance of justice. Practice what you preach, nobody in their right minds will listen to a man raving about the pros and cons of using feminine wash. You have a right to use Windows and lead a contented life of commercialism, but don't intrude on ours because you have no idea what you are talking about.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For *nix users, leave these people alone. They dont want your advice and whatever knowledge you can impart. We are only succeeding on egging them on and putting them on edge. They are not yet ready for our sophisticated system. They want an operating system that will spoon-feed them. They dont have the desire to know what happens below what they can see. We can only hope that we can impart knowledge on the people that counts, the people around us, and hope that they in turn will impart it to those around them. This article may be FUD but this is their kind of truth, and until they are ready to try something different then we really are talking to a wall. Consider the following phrases that I think is applicable to this situation:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People on the desert drink sand not because of thirst. They drink them because they dont know the difference"
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- from the movie "The American President"
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dont teach a pig how to dance. You are only wasting your time and succeeding only  in irritating the pig"
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- unknown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By posting I know that this will be flamed and twisted to another one's purpose. I dont care. Some men refuse to talk to dead people. I simply reserve the right to refuse talking to those who decided to be brain-dead.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Linus started Linux, but takes no credit for being the only creator.  Thousands of programmers from around the world have contributed.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is also extremely popular among Internet Service Providers.   The #1 internet search engine, Google, operates on Linux.  Scientists at national energy and defense labs use Linux.  Cash strapped students are a tiny minority of Linux users.
<BR>

<BR>
It is true that Mandrake only runs on Pentium computers.  That is its niche in the world of Linux distributions - they optimize for that type of computer.  Had you chosen RedHat, SuSE, Caldera or ANY other Linux distribution you would have been able to install it on your 486 or even your 386 if you had one.  For that matter Linux even runs on handheld computers like the Compaq iPaq and Palm Pilots.
<BR>

<BR>
It is true that Microsoft has not ported its software (Office, Outlook, Internet Explorer) to run on Linux.  Yet users of Linux enjoy web browsing with Netscape Navigator, Mozilla (an improved version of Navigator), Opera and other wonderful web browsers.  
<BR>

<BR>
Other software categories are also well represented under Linux.  I find it amazing that your critique them as "pitiful...unfinished, unreliable."  It shows that you have not used these programs that reliably provide everything that the vast majority of computer users need.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, there is no ZoneAlarm for Linux - because it is not needed.  Linux has built in firewall software.  Firewall software that has proven its worth over years of deployment.  
<BR>

<BR>
I suggest the author spend some time with Linux so that he can write a review based on experience instead of guesswork.  Failing that he should consider phlagarizing reviews from publications that have spent an adequate amount of time doing research.

<BR>

<BR>
2. Microsoft has not made Internet Explorer avalibe for Linux based OSs and prob will not. Tough to include something that does not exsist no?
<BR>

<BR>
3. Linux based OSs cannot run Win32 APIs without help from emmulators or VM products. Anybody who questions "why wont my windows programs run on another OS besies windows" should be shot on site. THIS IS NOT WINDOWS. WINDOWS APPS WONT RUN ON ANYTHING BUT WINDOWS. EOF
<BR>

<BR>
4. Linux Mandrake will run on your 486 just fine. It will also run with as little as 8MB of ram. If you had really read the manual (RTFM) this would be clear. Dont think that you can run a fancy GUI with this config. I am supprised that Windows 95 runs on this also.
<BR>

<BR>
5. There is anti virus software for Linux. Not need though as viruses are basicly a Windows only threat (very few mac and other OSs also). I challange you to show me a Linux Virus!
<BR>

<BR>
6. Funny that you bring up Zone Alarm. This is a very weak "firewall" product for windows. Linux has stateful firewalling built into the kernel (unlike windows where it runs as an application. This is a HUGE downfall). If you would have read the manual, you would see that there is a GUI for settup of firewalling. TRUE FIREWALLING unlike zone alarm.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Being you bought a Gateway, part of the price went to Microsoft for windows. It was not free by any means. Linux in itself is free but for a working OS w/books and support you will have to pay. From reading the article I see some benifit to you from support. 
<BR>

<BR>
6. I am 100% sure that BSD is not in any shape or form related to Sun because BSD in itself does not exist! Did you mean BSDi, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc? Some research on your end before posting lies to the world would have been nice.
<BR>

<BR>
You really should RTFM about Linux. Learn what it is and isnt before deciding to install. Sounds like you want windows and to run windows applications. This would make Linux not for you my friend.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Other than that, I won't keep with the criticism, he's had enough of that. And hopefully will give Linux another try but this time maybe he should use an easier version to install, like Red Hat.

(I say this because on my desktops/laptops it took an hour to install Mandrake and only 20 mins to install Red Hat. The hour wait is sometimes discouraging.) <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I use both windows 2000 (best OS M$ ever made) and I use Mandrake 8.1. I think both OS's have there merits and flaws. Linux is the under dog and still isn't friendly enough for the mass market. Windows 2000 is very nice, but has it's share of problems (biggest being cost).
<BR>

<BR>
I have made a list of the mistakes this author made in this article in regard to Mandrake 8.1.
<BR>

<BR>
In regard to the hardware issue:
<BR>
Mandrake 8.1 is designed for Pentiums and higher. 
<BR>
The original Linux as well as many other versions of Linux (eg Red Hat) are designed for 386 and higher.
<BR>

<BR>
In regard to the IE issue:
<BR>
The reason there is no IE for linux is because M$ doesn't have a version for Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
In regard to the Office issue:
<BR>
I agree Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes do not work under linux but Mandrake 8.1, but Mandrake provides free alternatives, that work perfectly fine with all M$ file formats.
<BR>

<BR>
In regard to the games issue:
<BR>
The top 3 online games at the moment all run on linux: Quake 3 Arena, Unreal Tournament, and Half-Life.
<BR>
www.lokigames.com has a wonderful listing of games for linux.
<BR>

<BR>
In regard to the security issue:
<BR>
Firstly there is no virus software for Linux as there are no viruses.
<BR>
Secondly there is a freewall in Mandrake 8.1, it's a version of bastille fire wall called Tiny Firewall.
<BR>

<BR>
I feel that this author should appologise for his mistakes, and possibly remove this article from this web site. As it is giving this web site a bad reputation.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hi,
<BR>

<BR>
First of all, the guys name was Linus not linux.
<BR>

<BR>
Second: M$ Office, Outlook and IE are Microsoft software, THEY choose not to supply them for linux because they want people to use windows not linux. 
<BR>
Third: There is more then one linux app that will open and save in M$ office file formats, anyone with half a brain can work out how to use them as its pretty much a standard menu system. Try Star Office and Openoffice.
<BR>

<BR>
Forth:, Mozilla is almost word for word standards compliant, IE is not. (although ie6 is close) so you lied.
<BR>
Fifth: You don't need a Pentium with 32MB ram to run linux, you can do it on a 386 with 8MB of ram. and boot it from a floppy (Trinix and others)you just need 32mb and a pentium to run Mandrake linux, since they rightly assume that people would rather have an OS that is optimised for the system they have, rather then one that is optimised for old hardware, you want to run linux on a 486, get Peanut or possibly Redhat. Also, try loading win2000 or XP on your 486. the versions of linux that were out when 95 came out, ran on 486's just fine, and the fact that some current versions can still run on it says alot, none of M$ recent versions will run on a 486 at all.
<BR>

<BR>
Sixth: RedHat, Caldera and others are not past names for linux distro's they are Current other distro's. People chose the one they want. which had you read up on, you wouldn't have tried to use Mandrake on a 486.
<BR>

<BR>
Seventh: Linux doesn't have virus software? thats probably because its nearly impossible to infect a properly linux box with a virus because of users,, you need root or admin access to do that. Windows XP home, like win98,98,98SE and ME make everyone root, so they are affected by virus's Also there are alot of linux virus scanners, like Trend Filescan, the thing is that they all search for windows virus's because there are none on linux that are a threat to anyone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Eighth: Linux doesn't need firewalls like Zone Alarm because the abiltiy is built into the OS, read ipchains and iptables, and Mandrake 8.1 has two firewalls built into it. InteractiveBastille does far more then most just by asking you a bunch of questions from a nice GUI interface.
<BR>

<BR>
Ninth: Software, Mandrake linux has server software that it would cost over 2000AUD to achieve with Microsoft(tm) software, and you wouldn't have been effected by Code Red or Nimda if you weren't running M$ software. it also comes standard with 2 or more versions of spreadsheets, word processors presentation software, finance stuff, advanced text editors, time management software email clients, graphing software, image editing software and more, and it all comes WITH Mandrake, you don't have to buy it seperatly.
<BR>

<BR>
Tenth: Games, what to play Quake3 on linux? go ahead, you can buy it for linux, ditto with many other titles. and with WINE, you can run a great many actual windows titles as well.
<BR>

<BR>
Please, if you are going to review a product at least get someone who knows what they are doing to review it objectively, you don't know because you only know the microsoft way and have a closed mind to anything else.
<BR>

<BR>
Remember windows has been around in a semi decent form since 1992 or so,, Unix, which is linux's parent has been around since the 60's... you just didn't know about it.
<BR>

<BR>
That is not the fault of linux.
<BR>

<BR>
I use both linux and windows, I started with an open mind and I am tipping more and more towards linux because it does everything I want, and I can have the same machine running without a reboot for months just fine (I have seen cases where it has run without reboot for well over a year.). and it didn't cost me 500 bucks to buy. 
<BR>

<BR>
Be objective when you review something, just because its not what you are used to, doesn't mean that its not better, (or conversely that its worse.)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I've found several problems with your article, in fact, most of the article is simply untrue, or not relevant to linux.<BR><BR>

<i>Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95, it seems that Linux requires far more powerful, and more expensive, computer hardware. </i><BR><BR>

Actually, Mandrake linux is the only distribution that requires a pentium class processor.  All other distibutions will run on a 486, and some even on a 386.  Mandrake has compiled all of their sourcecode with optimizations for Pentium processors.  Some applications actually run up to 80% faster with these optimizations, but the downside is that optimized apps will not run on anything less than a pentium processor.<BR><BR>

<i>For example, why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Linux? Despite the best efforts of the experts at the Internet Engineering Task Force to encourage adoption of the Internet Explorer standard, the creators of Linux seem to think that they know better. By refusing to adhere to recognised standards, Linux is simply undermining its own credibility.</i><BR><BR>

Unfortunately, Internet Explorer does not adhere to the HTML spec.  Many websites use HTML tags on their site that are specific to IE, however, this usually breaks the page or makes it appear funny to other browsers like Mozilla/Netscape, Gecko, Konqueror, and others (WebTV, Dreamcast, PS2, etc.).   IE currently has about 79% of the market share in the browser market, but it has gotten there because of MS's strongarm tactics.  In any case, the latest version's of Mozilla, Konqueror, and Opera work excellent under linux, and actually provide more functionality. 

<i>Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software is completely incompatible with Linux! It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express, or Lotus Notes will not work under Linux. </i><BR><BR>

That's because these programs are specifically for MS products.  There are similar offerings under linux, and contrary to what you say, many work extremely well.  The latest version of StarOffice from Sun.com is an MS office replacement that runs both under Windows and under Linux, and it's free.  KOffice is a Linux specific offering, and has more functionality than the average user needs, although it still doesn't have all of the features of MS Office yet.  KMail is a direct replacement for Outlook Express, and I've found that it is much faster and handles large mailboxes much faster.  Plus, it has advanced filtering options for people who get a lot of mail.  As for games, many of the popular games wouldn't run on your 486, even in windows.  However, Mandrake and TransGaming are releasing Mandrake Gaming Edition in November.  It's linux, but it comes with the windows version of the Sims, and will play most other windows games through an emulation layer called WINE.  WINE technically isn't an emulator, and most games actually run faster in WINE than they do in native windows.  Companies like Loki and ID Software also produce games for linux (Return to Wolfenstein and the entire Quake series work excellent under linux, and they run natively without WINE).<BR><BR>

<i>Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by the developers of Linux. In these times when hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Linux. To add insult to injury, there is no Linux version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Linux, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet.</i><BR><BR>

There are no virus scanners for linux because there are no virii for linux.  Linux is inherently secure against virus infection because of the security architecture of the operating system.  Yes, you heard me, viruses do not exist in Linux.  ZoneAlarm is a windows only product.  Linux comes with built in firewalling (either ipchains or iptables).  Both are tedious to set up manually, so Mandrake comes with a program called firewall which does it all for you.  When you install Mandrake, it asks you if you want to run it and it gets started automatically everytime your system boots.  It also handles strange protocols much more gracefully than ZoneAlarm, as iptables has stateful inspection so it can figure out what you're trying to do better.<BR><BR>

<i>The shortcomings of Linux are obvious. Without even installing Linux Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws.</i><BR><BR>

You didn't even install the operating system.  I have shown every single one of your claims to be false.<BR><BR>

<i>I recommend that those Adequacy readers who are hoping to upgrade their operating system patiently wait for the release of Windows XP, rather than foolishly wasting their time, effort and money on Linux. </i><BR><BR>

I don't know how one would waste their money on linux since it's free, as you have even pointed out.  Plus, Linux does not have some strange activation scheme like Windows XP, does not contact MS everytime you install a program to tell them that you have installed something else, and does not have questionable licensing schemes (MS wants to charge you a yearly fee to use their operating system and software).  Right now, WinXP home edition costs $199, and XP Professional costs $300.  I don't know about you, but I think free is much cheaper than the minimum $200 it's going to cost me to buy WinXP.  And since Linux does everything Windows XP does, for less money, and with more stability, I think I'll stick with my Mandrake 8.1 workstation and laptop.  (Note, I have Windows XP Professional build 2505, and it's just windows 2000 with a pastel colored interface, and tattle-tale's to MS when I install software on it).<BR><BR>

Yahoo, IBM, Compaq, I think Amazon also gets a few hits, well they are some form of linux. I'm sure alot of guys go to playboy, or hustler?  Hmmm, Altavista, ICQ.....see a pattern here?

Linux really is for development, never ment for games, but there are a few kick ass 3d games like Quake Arena, and you wonder why the graphics are smother and speed is faster well just remember movies like the matrix, tomb raider, the mummy, etc, all the special effects are done on SGI boxes, the titanic effects were done using Red Hat linux.
<BR>

<BR>
Let's see for security, if you can't afford a Cisco Pix firewall at home($1300 base), a 386 with 8 megs of memory, a floppy drive and two nick cards running anyone of about 10 single disk free firewall solutions(ebay $20) should be faster than any dlink, or linksys dsl/cable router out there and turn on DHCP and get usb phoneline network adapters and plug your other boxes or laptops in in anyroom without rewireing.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh and here, anyone want to mess with the author if he is stupid enough to rely on a $20 software firewall. If you use port 67 as the source port of a TCP or UDP scan, ZoneAlarm will let the
<BR>
packet through and will not notify the user. This means, that you can TCP or UDP port
<BR>
scan a ZoneAlarm protected computer as if there were no firewall there IF you use port
<BR>
67 as the source port on the packets.
<BR>

<BR>
Exploit:
<BR>
UDP Scan:
<BR>
You can use NMap to port scan the host with the following command line:
<BR>
nmap -g67 -P0 -p130-140 -sU 192.168.128.88 
<BR>
(Notice the -g67 which specifies source port).
<BR>

<BR>
TCP Scan:
<BR>
You can use NMap to port scan the host with the following command line:
<BR>
nmap -g67 -P0 -p130-140 -sS 192.168.128.88 
<BR>

<BR>
Also if you have a trojan or virus on your MS box already and are getting reamed by 12 yrs running free scripts, and go get zonealarm to try to fix it, here is a direct quote from Symantec: ZoneAlarm and ZoneAlarm Pro can be stopped from loading by creating a memory-resident Mutex (using a call to the CreateMutex API). Uninstalling\reinstalling ZoneAlarm in a different path has no effect.
<BR>
The impact of this vulnerability is that a Trojan running on a victim's machine can prevent ZoneAlarm from loading, and thus leave the victim open for attack.
<BR>

<BR>
Check out Conseal9 for a cheap real software pc firewall.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh yea, how many people own Tivo's? It's got a hard drive but it isn't formatted Win32 or NTFS.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh and wait till XP comes out, speaking of games, anyone try to play games on Win2k, nothing works on ME, not to mention the hardware requirements for most games to run on Windows means an upgrade every 6 months, which is about how often I have to reboot my linux servers, funny isn't it.

Honestly, I'm quite amazed one the high number of posts of obvious intelligent, promising linux-hackers (I even learnd one or two things about lynx and nmap) that simply do not recognize that this article is meant to be a JOKE!!!

<BR>


<BR>
Instead of checking other articles at www.adequacy.org they simply start their flame war.

<BR>


<BR>
I thought that Linux (and other OSes like BeOS, AtheOS, QNX, *BSD) are still reserved form some kind of educated elite.

<BR>


<BR>
But I seem to be mistaken. Mandrake 8.1 is so easy to install that more and more people who cannot even understand satires are running Linux...

While the writer's ignorance of the Linux operating system and how it differs from the Microsoft Windows model is exceptional, the quality of comments that have been posted in response to the article are truly disheartening.
<BR>

<BR>
I won't go into a critique of the article since others here seem to have highlighted its many holes, but I will say that I use both Windows (98 and 2000) and Linux (Mandrake, SuSE, and RedHat) and will comfortably state that nothing this writer states should be taken at face-value, much less as true.
<BR>

<BR>
What worries more is the number of 4-letter words that have been posted in response. For a site that is supposed to be "News for Grown-ups", the readership obviously doesn't fit the profile of the target audience.
<BR>

<BR>
I won't come here again. Not because of the poor journalistic standards, but because the net is littered with respectful commmunities containing helpful, kind-hearted people and this place is not one of them. Until those of you who have made these posts grow up, please stay here, at this poorly named Adequacy.org.

I have been using personal computers since MSDOS 1.x, suffered through the initial release of Windows that ran in 320x200 on an XT.  Strugled with the Windows 3.1 release and it's poor support for networking.  The Windows95, 98, 98se, NT, 2000, XP releases (which have finally reached some level of stability) have been monopolistic behemoths attempting to stuff as much of other people's products into an operating system while pricing it so low the competition is forced out of business.  Now that they've eliminated much of the competition they start pushing the prices up. <br> It's ironic that Microsoft itself used samples of the blue screen of death to tell the world that Windows2000 should be more stable than previous releases.  One of Gates' comments about 2000 was that the previous version of WinNT had an average server uptime of approximately 5 days.  <strong>FIVE DAYS,</strong> imagine that you could almost make it a week without having to take the server down and restart it. Yes that is average, some longer, some shorter.  <br><br>My <strong>Linux </strong> boxes only come down if I take them down for moving, prolonged power outages, hardware upgrades etc.  I have not tried to run <strong>Linux</strong> on a 486 but have run it on Pentium 75, 90, 120, 266 dual pentium pro, quad pentium pro and dual PentiumII 400 machines with anything from 16 megabytes of RAM to 256MB, it supports higher.  The install runs smoothly each and every time I build a server.  I can build one from a bootable CDROM or via an NFS mounted or HTTP connected remote server.    Somewhere, someone quoted this site as complaining that <strong>Linux</strong> doesn't come with the "industry standard" Internet Explorer.  F.Y.I. <strong>Mozilla / Netscape</strong> are the industry standards.  The only thing standard about IE is it is one of the highest crashing applications on Bugtoaster.com's <a href="http://www.bugtoaster.com/DW15/Reports/AllCrashes.asp?MaxCrashItems=50&ShowApps=TRUE">Real Statistics</a>
<br><br>
Get off your high horse, spend some time really understanding what you're purporting to write about.  I'll never own XP and as soon as Sierra comes out with a <strong>Linux</strong> GUI for Half-Life I'll trash my WindowsMe for Red Hat or one of the other excellent releases without a second thought.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Linux is not an evil hackers OS, its an OS with a specific use, just as windows works best as a desktop/workstation because of its ease of use, and graphical interface; linux is ideal for servers, it has (by default) no GUI, cutting down on wasted resources, much better server software, and is much better suited to running as a server. Which is why most desktops have windows and most webservers have linux/apache<br><br>

In fact, Open source software is much better suited to a server environment, where the ability to finely customiSe the application comes into its own.<br><br>

now. for the average stupid user, windows is great, you people are obviously all both ignorant and stupid, so keep using it! If however you would like the ability to customise your software at code level, then linux is the obvious choice.<br><br>

imho, microsoft have tried to do too much with windows... what is the point of bundling a webserver with win2k? (and i think XP too) look what happened: code red. code red was hilarious, i laughed my arse off when i discovered thousands upon thousands of hits from codered infected machines on our webserver... almost every single one of those machines were accesible (as in you could read, write, and remove data) through Internet explorer (ooooh hax0ring tool) Had IIS been open source, it would never have been released, its a stupid, stupid, stupid hole that microsoft should have fixed long ago<br><br>

Telnet. Telnet is not a hacking tool. it is a tool, its not for hacking. you CAN hack with it, but you can also hack with IE. Telnet is bundled with windows along with a buncha other network-type stuff that can be used for any number of network related applications. I use it(along with ssh, similar but encrypted) several times a day, in fact i probably clock up two or three hours a day, I use it for completely legitimate purposes... anything from administering websites/servers to diagnosing network problems. The only things you can see with telnet are sent specifically by the webserver. it is all information that is unencrypted, and the only reason your browser doesnt display it is because its boring, no one cares what webserver you use.<br><br> 

Exploits will always exist both in closed and open source software; but microsofts 'security by obscurity' policies are fatally flawed, known exploits are used and abused for months before being fixed, just cos they dont want to admit to making mistakes. Open source software is infinintly more secure, fixes are posted within hours of finding exploits, you can even modify the code yourself if you need to.<br><br>

Just because some of the software we use would not be here if it wasnt for microsoft, consider this; if it wasnt for the porn industry we would not have VHS video, streaming media, DVD or VCD, plus newspapers wouldn't be as widespread (sales of printing presses didnt take off for years until the first printed pornographic material was produced). Now. does that make the porn industry a good thing?<br><br>

If you cant secure your site from someone who wouldn't be able to get this information elsewhere, then you <strong>ARE NOT FIT TO BE WEBSITE ADMINISTRATORS</strong> and it is people like you that <strong>ENCOURAGE</strong> scriddies by leaving gaping holes for them to wander in. Its like leaving your car door unlocked... if someone nicks your stereo, its illegal, but its your own stupid fault and your insurance company would (rightly) tell you to fssk off.<br><br>

<strong>YOU</strong> are to blame for every stupid 15yo scriddie who hacks a website and gets locked up. its <strong>YOU</strong> who are responsible for spam, by having insecure mailservers. its <strong>YOU</strong> that encourage warez/porn trading with badly-configured public ftp's and other stupid oversights and its <strong>YOU</strong> that are increasing making the internet an increasing unfulfilling place to be. Fuck you and fuck your fucking fuckwits web-fucking-site. fuckers
