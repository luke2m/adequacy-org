      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>Computer security is a big concern these days. It's a hot topic in technical publications such as Slashdot and Dr. Dobbs Weekly, and we even see a lot about it in the mainstream media. But how many people really understand the issues? As a software engineering professional and a concerned citizen, I'd like to take some time to cover the basics. <strong>The arcane, secretive priesthood of technical matters usually prefers obfuscation and bluffery, but is such an approach really in the public interest?</strong> In my view, it is not. I want to enable you, the common man, to make informed decisions about security concerns as they affect you and your loved ones in your daily lives. Life in a modern, pluralistic, democratic society demands no less. </p>

<p>We'll begin at the beginning. Everybody's favorite perennial security story is <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. For years, their International Information Server product has been at the center of a storm of highly technical controversy, as has the Windows NT ("Network Technology") kernel. What is this controvery really about, in layman's terms? It all starts with a concept known as "<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">Object Oriented Programming</a>". </p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>

<p>In the early 1980s, <strong>Microsoft's Research department had a vision</strong>, a vision of a future where computers would be more than just adding machines and glorified typewriters. They had a vision of finding a way for computers to <em>communicate with each other</em>, a vision they called the "Network". They saw that this "Network" would enable the pervasive, world-wide sharing of information on a scale that had never been imagined before. There was no doubt that it would revolutionize society. Those brilliant men were gripped by this vision, and they knew that Microsoft, as the acknowledged world leader in technology with a tradition of acting in the public interest, was the only organization which had a fighting chance of bringing this miracle into being. </p>

<p>First, Microsoft "surveyed the literature", as they say. Government-funded academics had made abortive attempts to enable computers to share information on a small, local scale, but these efforts lacked both the wide-ranging vision of <a href="http://www.heritage.org/">private enterprise</a>, and the vigor of healthy competition. It was the sad lack of vision that really killed those projects: They were attempting to do everything with old-fashioned, obsolete "<a href="http://dinosaur.com">procedural programming</a>", a method of software creation where an application consists of a long sequence of simple instructions, and "proceeds" from one to the next, from beginning to end. Such an application is unable to perform modern tasks such as Document creation or electronic mail. It is also unable to create the "packets" which are necessary for communication between computers. <strong>The academic attempts at crude "Networking" turned out, under close examination, to have been <a href="http://www.americanindian.com">hoaxes</a>:</strong> Two computers would be prepared with identical applications, which would "proceed" simultaneously. One would send the message "Hello" to the other, and the other would have been programmed to display "Hello" as input at the same moment. The unfree academic approach was clearly a dead end. Nobody but the commissars of DARPA is satisfied with a crude sham in lieu of a dream. </p>

<h3>The Revolution</h3>

<p>Microsoft decided to revolutionize the field of software by creating "object oriented programming", which means that an application is composed of semi-autonomous "objects", each of which reacts to input from the outside and can act entirely independently of the "mother ship" application. Some highly advanced "objects" -- such as Microsoft's crowning glory, the Internet Explorer Document -- may even be dispatched through a "Network Interface Console" such as a modern digital "modem" telephone or the Internet. This was the "philosopher's stone" which ultimately made the dream of Networking an everyday reality. </p>

<p>Once they knew their vision was practical, Microsoft's researchers set about creating a "application language" which would put the power of their new "object paradigm" into the hands of ordinary engineers everywhere. A "application language" is a sophisticated tool for creating applications which can view or create Documents. Microsoft didn't create just one; they created several. All of the application languages which are now widely used were created in Microsoft's labs in the late 1980s as their dream of Networking steadly matured: Visual Basic, Visual Front Page, MFC++. MFC++ and Visual Front Page are highly arcane tools used only by a few advanced "wizards" to perform specialized tasks, and as such they are not relevant to the present discussion. The real star of the bunch was Visual Basic, which made the creation of Internet Document Applications and Objects so easy and intuitive that millions of programmers around the world were able to join in. As we now know, they did, and we were all swept up in the magic and productivity of the Information Age -- the very magic which brings you the Document file you are now reading. Visual Basic replaced the old-fashioned mysterious commands of DOS-like languages with a revolutionary <em>visual</em> way of creating Document Applications, thus changing programming forever. Visual Basic was used to create Microsoft's revolutionary object oriented Network Operating System, Windows 95, the Operating System which made the Internet a reality. </p>

<p>The future had arrived, but there's always a serpent in Eden, isn't there? Microsoft had envisioned an "open architecture" of information, where users would share information as they liked. This was na&iuml;ve. We all use computers and the Internet, don't we? Do you know anybody who <em>abuses</em> these gifts? I sure don't. Honest people want to <a href="http://msn.microsoft.com">chat online</a> with their friends and trade jokes on <a href="http://hotmail.com">email</a>. What Microsoft forgot was that while <em>most</em> Americans are honest, <strong>some aren't.</strong> Furthermore, it's a big world out there, where the core American values of democracy and freedom are not always respected. </p>

<h3>The Reaction</h3>

<p>Microsoft's mistake was <em>trust</em>. It sounds crazy, doesn't it, that <em>trust</em> could be a <em>mistake?</em> I agree, it <em>is</em> crazy, <em>to you and me</em> -- <strong>but we're Americans.</strong> In technical terms, the problem was that Microsoft's revolutionary "objects" often contained private information such as passwords and credit card numbers. Now, you and I and Bill Gates don't look over a friend's shoulder when he's using an ATM machine, and we don't read our friends' mail, so these "objects" depended for security on the fact that decent people respect each others' privacy. Visual Basic does not support a feature called "private data members". This means that any user who accesses an <a href="http://dildo.com">object or Document</a> can view all of the contents of that Document, and change them at will. Nobody thought that this would be a problem, because only a sick person would violate the privacy of somebody else's Internet Document. Besides, who needs that kind of paranoid security? I don't know about you, but I have nothing to hide. </p>

<p>But some people don't know right from wrong. </p>

<p>A shadowy underworld of "hackers" came into being to exploit this so-called "weakness" (isn't it a strange moral inversion, when <strong>trust</strong>, the great strengh of a free society, is called a "weakness"?). The "hackers", mostly college students urged on by leftist academics, developed their own application language, called "C++". It was a crude imitation of MFC++, but it had one feature which only criminals would have thought of in those innocent days: <strong>Private</strong> data members. A "C+" application could create Documents which were impenetrable to the prying eyes of other so-called "hackers". "C+" was used to create an entire underground "operating system" called "Linux", developed in the chaos of former <a href="http://www.sun.com">Iron Curtain</a> nations in Eastern Europe. It had no visionary features such as taskbars and <a href="http://www.phonesex.com">Dialup Networking</a>. In fact, it openly borrowed all but one of its ideas from Microsoft's legendary MS-DOS application, long since rendered obsolete by the overwhelming success of Windows 95. The one original idea the "hackers" had was, I must stress, <strong>security.</strong> You and I may have nothing to hide, but a "hacker" has a thousand things to hide, from his friends, from his parents, and most importantly from law enforcement. </p>

<p>Seemingly secure in the claustrophobic privacy and paranoia of their tiny "Linux" kingdoms, the "hackers" set out to wreck the Internet. They couldn't understand it and they could never have created it, but they knew that Microsoft's new vision of openness frightened them. So they released their crude, poisonous C+ objects and Documents -- called "viroses" -- out into the chat rooms and Web Sites of the Internet. </p>

<h3>The Confrontation</h3>

<p>Of course, the "hackers" didn't think it through. They didn't reckon on the innovative vigor of their adversary. By 1996, Microsoft had created the first experimental "anti-Viros" programs, which could sweep Document Folders and Web Sites clean of malicious viros objects. The "arms race" was on. <strong>Microsoft never fell behind again.</strong> They loved the challenge, of course. The problem was that while they could keep outsmarting the "hackers" forever, this wasn't what they regarded as an "elegant" solution. Furthermore, they were under attack by academics who had bribed officials of the United States Government to do their bidding. Without the Constitution's guarantee of liberty, Microsoft was aware that they ran a terrible risk of losing the battle. What if they did? Their anti-Viros efforts would cease, and their greatest creation, the Internet Web, would be gnawed to death by rats. </p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>A new urgency inflamed Microsoft Research. They were fighting the battle of their lives, and time seemed as if it might be running out. They decided to fight fire with fire: They would implement "private data members". That one audacious move would erase the viros threat permanently, and the "hackers" would become nothing more than an ugly memory like the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Luddites</a>, <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org">Ranters</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">Jacobins</a>, and <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Thuggee</a> of centuries gone by. The freedom of the Internet could never be threatened again. </p>

<p>Once the great decision had been made, progress was rapid, and the fruits are already beginning to appear. Visual Basic is to be retired with honors and replaced by a new application language called C# (pronounced "Seek"), which supports full private data members while still allowing them to be accessed by family and friends. In addition, the Internet Web paradigm is to be phased out gradually and replaced by the new .NET Architecture, a more flexible and sophisticated <a href="http://www.supermodels.com">Document Object Model</a> than the well-loved classic Internet Explorer. </p>

<p>The great "Computer Security" debate has been rendered obsolete. Oh, and there's more good news: Remember those rogue Justice Department employees who launched that crusade against the freedom of the Internet? A few took their bribes and retired to South America; the rest of them are in prison now. As for "Linux"? It was unable to compete with private enterprise, and has mostly vanished. Even their <a href="http://linox.com">web sites</a> are no longer maintained. </p>

<BR><BR>I think you mean INERNET Information Server<BR><BR>

<b> They had a vision of finding a way for computers to communicate with each other , a vision they called the "Network". They saw that this "Network" would enable the pervasive, world-wide sharing of information on a scale that had never been imagined before.</b>

<BR><BR>So all the UNIX servers that were already running large Wide Area Networks (WANs) and smaller corporate LANs didn't exist?  So the fact that Microsoft didn't work with IBM to develop a new Network OS called OS/2?  If this is an idea MS came up with in the early 80s then they were WAY behind the time.<BR><BR>

<b>There was no doubt that it would revolutionize society. Those brilliant men were gripped by this vision, and they knew that Microsoft, as the acknowledged world leader in technology with a tradition of acting in the public interest, was the only organization which had a fighting chance of bringing this miracle into being.</b>

<BR><BR>That's why Microsoft's first networking project was simple client/server stuff the used Windows 3.1 for workgroups on the client side and Unix systems on the server side.<BR><BR>

<b>First, Microsoft "surveyed the literature", as they say. Government-funded academics had made abortive attempts to enable computers to share information on a small, local scale, but these efforts lacked both the wide-ranging vision of private enterprise, and the vigor of healthy competition.</b>

<BR><BR>Yeah projects like ARPANET (1962, way before MS was even founded) and MilNet (even sooner) were so small.  The only connected systems around the world.  Other countries later started there own ARPANETs<BR><BR>

<b> It was the sad lack of vision that really killed those projects: They were attempting to do everything with old-fashioned, obsolete "procedural programming ", a method of software creation where an application consists of a long sequence of simple instructions, and "proceeds" from one to the next, from beginning to end. Such an application is unable to perform modern tasks such as Document creation or electronic mail. It is also unable to create the "packets" which are necessary for communication between computers.</b>

<BR><BR>Where the hell did you get that information!?!  Did you pull that out of your ass?<BR><BR>

<b>The academic attempts at crude "Networking" turned out, under close examination, to have been hoaxes:  Two computers would be prepared with identical applications, which would "proceed" simultaneously. One would send the message "Hello" to the other, and the other would have been programmed to display "Hello" as input at the same moment. The unfree academic approach was clearly a dead end. Nobody but the commissars of DARPA is satisfied with a crude sham in lieu of a dream.</b>

<BR><BR>I'm starting to think you're either attempting to cause a fight between educated people and idiots that think you're serious.  Either that or you're just really dumb<BR><BR>

I can't go on.  Reading the utter factual errors and total misuse of jargon and technical terms (and at times trying to make up you own) is almost sickening.  Anybody else wanna take this?<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

I'm not going to bother lecturing you guys about the different types of computer storage that exist and their traditional names, considering that similiar things done by previous posters usually land up being a waste of disk space.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Disk space is composed of unused regions of your hard drive (you know, that thing with the silvery platters of metal inside it that 99% of personal computers contain). Not all of the hard drive's space (ie. unallocated cylinders) are always used, and these unallocated cylinders are referred to as 'disk space'. If you have lots of 'disk space', you can put lots of 'softwarez' onto your hard drive.

<BR>

<BR>
I found this information on an Apple ex-employee's website.
<BR>

<BR>
The computer network is truly one of Microsoft's greatest innovations. The concept began in the early days of the industry when Microsoft developed the first operating system, which was later adapted to be used on the IBM PC.
<BR>

<BR>
IBM wanted a way to allow their licensed operating system to operate on multi-processor/multi-RAM systems. Microsoft answered this by devoting millions of dollars of research into what they termed "computer networking." Not only did Microsoft present IBM with their multi-processor solution, which IBM labelled "OS/2" (Operating System / 2, 2 meaning "multiprocessor"), but they also innovated the computer-to-computer connection now called the "internet."
<BR>

<BR>
The Internet made great strides in the educational community, due to Microsoft's dominant presence on college campuses. Microsoft continued to add new features and security enhancements to their networking system, such as the ability to read the IP address from the computer modem's ROM and use it to track illegal use of systems connected to the network. This technology was dubbed "token ring" referring to the exchange of IP addresses as "tokens" in a networking "ring."
<BR>

<BR>
But the wide acceptance of Microsoft's new networking system on college campuses wasn't without its drawbacks. Microsoft even allowed campuses access to their valuable computer "code" (a file containing mathematical equations and various operating system commands). Their hope was to encourage the spread of the concept of computer networking to facilitate the free exchange of ideas across the world. While Microsoft's vision of empowering the oppressed and financially underprivileged was a noble one, a band of computer "hackers", led by Richard M Stalmann, had different ideas.
<BR>

<BR>
This group of "hackers," operating illegally from the University of Berkely, would break into the computer labs late at night and steal the computer code from the campus mainframe. One of those codes was Microsoft's innovative networking code.
<BR>

<BR>
Microsoft was stunned when their networking technology appeared in a new hacker operating system written by Linux Torvaldes. This operating system (egotistically named "Linux" after its creator), has steadily gained popularity in the computer underground ever since. This incident led Microsoft founder and lead programmer Bill Gates to make the famous comment, "software should be free, as in speech, not free as in beer".
<BR>

<BR>
Unfortunately, Microsoft had no legal remedy in this situation. Since the hacker underground is composed of thousands of shady characters, spread across the world who all use illegal computer modems (the V-chip, which supplies the IP tokens, has been removed), Microsoft had noone to sue. The damage these hackers have caused to the internet is incalculable, since they're illegal code is used in critical portions of the internet, they are allowed to dictate many of the standards by which various subsystems of the internet are governed.

<BR><BR><b>The computer network is truly one of Microsoft's greatest innovations. The concept began in the early days of the industry when Microsoft developed the first operating system, which was later adapted to be used on the IBM PC.</b>

<BR><BR>Computer networks were around much longer than Microsoft.  All you have to do is look at IBM's AIX, Hewlette-Packard's HP-UX, or Compaq's Tru64 (and yes Compaq is also older than MS).  Also MS did <b>NOT</b> create the first operating system.  I can name a number of OSes that pre-date even DOS (which they didn't even develop, they bought it).  How about UNIX or CP/M.  Not to mention that Apple's Lisa had a GUI while MS was still screwing around with DOS.

MS answered this with millions.  Of what money?  MS was helping to develop OS/2 while under contract from IBM.  They never finished it before IBM realised MS was devoting more time to their own projects and not IBMs.  MS didn't HAVE millions to throw around.  In other words they were using IBMs money to fund their work.  Also the name OS/2 has nothing to do with MP.  Its name realtes to the second generation of IBM offered OSes.

Huh!?!  Sorry but UNIX is still dominant in the server rooms at most Universities.  IBM developed Token Ring and it predates MS as well.  Check history against the founding date of MS.  Token Ring doesn't involve a modem, track illegal use, nor does it exchange IP addresses.  A network card and a MAU are require when using token ring.  You really don't know anything about networking do you?  Here's a lesson.

<BR><BR>Token passing involves a 3-byte packet, called a token, which is transmitted from one node to another around the ring.  If a computer on the ring has information ti transmit, it picks up the token packet, adds the control and data information plus the destination's node address to transform the token into a data fram and then passes the token on to the next node.  The tranformed token, now in the form of a frame, circulates around the network until it reaches the its intended destination.  The destination node picks it up and returns an acknowledgement messageto the originating node.  After the originating node receives the acknowledgement, it releases a new free token and sends it down the ring.<BR><BR>

And before you post something stupid like MS invented Ethernet.  Bob Metcalfe's Harvard PhD Thesis outlined the idea for Ethernet. David Boggs, Butler Lampson, Bob Metcalfe, and Charles Thacker of Xerox PARC filed a patent for Ehternet.  They received patent number 4,063,220 in 1977.  The concept was tested on Xerox PARC's Alto computers, and the first Ethernet network called the Alto Aloha System.  This was only 2 years after the founding of Micro-Soft (they later dropped the hyphen) before Bill and Company went to work for IBM (the company was founded while they developed BASIC (pre-DOS) for the Altair 8800).

<BR><BR>I assume you are referring to the TCP/IP stack from FreeBSD.  Kind of strange since that code predates DOS!  DOS doesn't have a TCP/IP stack.  Hell early versions of DOS had NO networking capabilities what-so-ever.  Not to mention that MS was working on Windows while still under contract by IBM.  So it was IBM's machines.  For a guy that claims he's OLDER than me, your timeline is ALL FUCKED UP!

<br>
I recommend you dispense with the baseless accusations and empty threats and actually try engaging in a coherent discussion with those who do not have the same mindset as you.<br>
<br>
This site is not the safe harbor of intelligent discussion that it's claimed to be.  If you make a comment that mindlessly agrees with the article, <a href="./2001.12.21.195051.13.html#2">your post gets rated high by regulars</a>.  If you make a post outright disagreeing, <a href="./2001.12.19.21302.725.html#7">you're labeled a criminal, threatened and rated down</a>.  If you make a post that presents an intelligent, controversial point, <a href="./2001.11.24.171946.21.html#68">it gets quietly ignored</a>.<br>
<br>
Yes, these are general observations.  No, I'm not accusing any one person of treating comments in that manner.  However, the Adequacy community does tend to act that way.  The community here is just as biased and brazen as what you may find at Slashdot or Kuro5hin, creating a community that's just as tedious and tiresome as the others can be.  It just so happens the people here tend to be biased in the opposite direction.<br>

<BR><BR>That's certainly not what our IP token analyzer has told us.  And, to be quite frank, I believe hard data over your cyber-hacker lies.  According to our information, you accessed our PRIVATE statistics page on no less than three occassions, using Apache - an "Open Source" web browser.  And we all know Open Source is just a euphemism for "Illegal Hacker Tool".

<BR><BR>Of course IE is not illegal.  But - as you well know - that IS NOT what you are using.  Of course I will not point out your pedophilic comments.  They have been hidden and passed along to our lawyers, along with our IP token information.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I've yet to actually read a post from one so ignorant as he. As to a previous comment regarding Christ, do you honestly believe you're a better Christian because you're rich? If so you don't beleive in God, you don't beleive in Christ, you believe in the dollar bill, nothing more, and may you burn in hell with your stack of cash.

Back to OSM, God bless this funny little man. You constant rantings about hackers and IP tokens and hacker software is all too amusing, yet untrue. You fail to admit that Apple stol the GUI from Xerox, and that Billy Bob and his cronies stole the GUI from Apple while 'developing' it for them, though the information has been documented in numerous areas and some of these have been made available to you. You also fail to admit in multiple other instances where others have provided an intelligent arguement backed up by FACTS. You also claim the Linux is a hacker's OS because it wasn't created by your precious Microsoft. Linux is an OS for the computer savvy that are sick of Windows and it's many, many failings. People who like to creat their OS to run what they want and how they want with a degree of stability unmatched by windows. So until you can get a proper computer education you can quit your idiotic and mindless bashing of Linux and it's many users. On a side note: People that disagree with you and you moronic cohorts aren't hackers, and drug adicts or pedophiles, they just know what they're talking about, because that's their job, that's their hobby, and they're damned good at them. You can also go ahead and rant about getting my IP 'token' address and accuse me of being a hacker, which is virtually impossible because they have our work stations protected very well here at MSN. Yes, that's right, MSN, that awful ISP spawned by one of the worst companies to grace God's wonderful planet. So go ahead, try your hardest to get my info, report, me and get me fired! But alas, you are full of idle threats and I expect nothing to come of this. You have a great day, fool, and may you one day be blessed with the knowledge of the extent of your stupidity.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<b>Is your modem Microsoft certified WITH THE V-CHIP INTACT?</b>

<BR><BR>Modems don't have V-chips you idiot.  That's why firewall, proxy software and programs like NetNanny are available.<BR><BR>

<b>Microsoft continued to add new features and security enhancements to their networking system, such as the ability to read the IP address from the computer modem's ROM and use it to track illegal use of systems connected to the network. This technology was dubbed "token ring" referring to the exchange of IP addresses as "tokens" in a networking "ring." </b>

<BR><BR>Let's analyze this.  Token Ring was invented by IBM.  It is used on high speed local area networks.  It requires a token ring car and each computer to be connected directly or through the use of a Multistation Access Unit (MAU).  ROM is READ ONLY MEMORY.  It's statically stored instructions sets on a chip.  So it would be really hard to read someone else's IP address from this since it would be reading the same thing over and over and over again.  Token Ring does NOT "exchange IP addresses".  Each machine requires it's own unique IP address whether it is currently transmitting or not.<BR><BR>

<b>Are you accessing this site through an approved high-speed IP token bridge like AOL?</b>

<BR><BR>Token Ring is only used on LOCAL AREA NETWORKS.  It's an old technology that was replaced by ETHERNET.  It has nothing to do with dial up.  Token Ring only allows for transmission at 4/16Mbps while Ethernet transmits at 10/100/1000Mbps.  When was the last time you had a dial up modem transmit at 4Mbps?  More like 56Kbps.  Hopefully you can tell the difference between Mbps (megabits per second) and Kbps (kilobits per second.<BR><BR>

<b>Are you using certified Microsoft hack-proof products?</b>

<BR><BR>On this computer all I am using now is a fresh install of Windows XP, IE6 and MSN.  That's it.  I can still access all the information I did before.<BR><BR>

<b>No, I didn't think so, because our IP token analyzer told us that already.</b>

<BR><BR>A token is 3-bytes.  Kind of hard to store that much information in 3 BYTES!<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>You are facing an uphill battle not only against readers of this site, network professionals, and EVERY piece of networking literature known to man.  Not to mention anyone with at least half a friggin brain.  Hell I'll mail you a copy of the Net+ and MCSE Certification Preparation manuals so you can read them and finally learn you are a retard.

For 'osm's information, Unix was developed as a high-speed OS for network usage - Linux, an OS used on many web servers today, is a variant of Unix.  Linux and Unix are not used primarily for hacking, although Microsoft zzealots seem to think otherwise.

(yes I know they are on the 12th now buit the 3rd has MS-DOS info in it)  This book is most certainly NOT a crackers manual (hacker should be a compliment - it means highly skilled PC person, you wanted the word Cracker), rather, it is a respected manual used by many to aid them in their PC servicing needs.  The remainder is a compilation of reading MANY PC books (and old manuals):
<BR>

<BR>
--------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Before Microsoft, there was a simple OS used on variants of the Altair hobbyist PC (built by hobbyists affectionately known as HACKERS)
<BR>
and the Apple II - Control Program/Microcomputer, or simply CP/M.  When Intel developed the 8086 and 8088 from the (4004 to the) 8080, 8085, and Z80 chips, IBM proceeded to release the 5100-series PC - an office computer that used cp/m '86.
<BR>

<BR>
Seattle Computers made an operating system based on the CP/M OS and sold it to a then-fledgeling Microsoft.  That became MS-DOS V. 1.0.
<BR>

<BR>
Eventually Microsoft and IBM teamed up to produce new generic versions of DOS (ever hear of IBM/PC-DOS?).  IBM's DOS was a more reliable OS, with better support programs (Scott Mueller agrees with me!).  Eventually, when the 80286 (IBM PC/AT) came out, IBM developed OS/2 V. 1, an OS designed to use the protected mode functions of the 286 over the 8086/8's 'real mode'.  MS just kept using the same old DOS, eventually releasing the Windows GUI, which relied on DOS to do its work (consumer-level Windows wasn't a real OS until Win98 came out - NT was used for businesses only).  Windows was HIGHLY trouble prone due to the fact that it relied on MS-DOS to do all the work.
<BR>

<BR>
When the 80386DX was released, IBM released OS/2 V. 2, a very powerful OS that took full advantage of the 80386's advanced capabilities over the 80286 CPU.  MS still stuck with Windows, now showing it's problems.  Win95 ("Chicago") was VERY unstable due to MS's lack of want to get off of DOS.
<BR>

<BR>
Unfortunately, due to MS's advertising campaigns, alternative better OS's like OS/2, Unix, and Linux bever gained popularity, and now we are stuck with Microsoft's WinXP, which forces non-technicians to only use Microsoft products, unless they can disable the code present in the OS that automatically changes settings on bootup.
<BR>
Microsoft has sealed their monopoly, and we are stuck with a pile of feces.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is still used because of a concept of "open-source", which allows you, the consumer, to modify the OS as you see fit, so it works exactly how YOU want it to, as opposed to some multibillionaire in Redmond's wants (you know who I mean).
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and I don't use Outlook, and I use a third-party web browser.  There, avoids most all of my "cracker" problems.
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<BR>
Oh yes, I recommend you pick up the book:
<BR>

<BR>
Repairing and Upgrading PC's, 12th Edition
<BR>
   By Scott Mueller
<BR>

<BR>
You will find that it will give you actual PC knowledge as opposed to the crap you put out.  Your idea of a token ring network, 'osm' was totally wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, since I already used a lot of space, I'll just put in the Glossary definition of 'token ring'.
<BR>

<BR>
--------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Token Ring:
<BR>

<BR>
A type of LOCAL AREA network in which the wrokstations relay a packet of data called a token in a logical ring configuration.  When a station wants to transmit, it takes possesion of the token, attaches its data, then frees the token after the data has made a complete circut of the electrical ring. [Peer-to-Peer]
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------
<BR>

<BR>
At that point, EtherNet wasn't much of a factor, due to the inefficiency that plagued it in 1992.
<BR>
Notice, a LOCAL, NON-INTERNET network.
<BR>

<BR>
I am only 14 years of age, but I have been using IBM-Compatable PC's since I was 5, helping build PC's since I was 9, and have been building my own PC's with no supervision since 12.  I an a huge gamer, so I have had to read MANY books to learn how to eke every drop of performance from my PC's.  My father makes good money writing tech manuals and building PC's.  And I mean assemble them at my residence, not go to some company and tell them what I want in it.  And at this point, I am taking a Sr. High class on programming in Visual Basic to expand my knwoledge beyond Q-Basic and Z80 Assembly Language, and I'm planning to take the C++ independent study next year, so I can use the more powerful language (to the person who wrote the original article, C++ is a far more powerful language than any form of Basic).
<BR>

<BR>
I understand how people can be computer illiterate, but when they decide to get up and put crap like this into the world without doing research, it makes me sick.  Thank you, Nawl and the others.  At least there are some in this world who know what they are talking about.

<br>
The post I referred to may have asked a seemingly boring question, but it's poltroon's answer which illuminates.  Here's an excerpt,<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I think viewers often bring more to art than an artist could have fully intended. I guess the images are like saying, here this does something to me, how about you?</blockquote>

Here, the artist herself is saying that the meaning of the work is subjective.  Whatever meaning she has attatched to the piece can be completely opposite of the meaning others find in it.<br>
<br>
In his article, elenchos used her art to belittle those who are deemed "inadequate".  Here are some of his words,<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Could you name even one of the references in it? Explicate even one of the symbols? No, you could not. There is no shame in admitting it.</blockquote>

However, poltroon's post makes elenchos' point moot.  She says that her art asks the viewer, "What do I do you for you?"  There is no right or wrong answer as elenchos implied.  If I found that the piece made me feel joyful or if I thought that it was symbolic for solitude, it would not be the incorrect interpretation of the piece.  There is no incorrect interpretation.  The viewers interpretation is subjective.  This was the admitted intention of the artist.<br>
<br>
Regardless, this is all elementary to you.  But by ignoring the basics, it's hard to realize that what you construe from them can be flawed.<br>

Anybody can interpret art.  You may value one interpretation over another, but that doesn't invalidate the other interpretations.<br>

Well thats EXACTLY how this article sounded to me. All these jargon words are there but in weird orders and describe things which dont exist.

I tried to get more, but the poor girl is already so far gone in believeing this government propaganda that she called the police every time I approached her or her jeep with my camera.  I only wanted images of her for scale, you see.  My neighbor is 5 feet and six inches tall, which is an ideal height.  I think she weighs about 105 pounds.

<BR>

<BR>
(as a former CS-nut-turned-writer, i have some other issues with the article; it's just poor writing. eightymd misspells "controversy" in the second paragraph. he/she uses sexist language like "the common man." (i'm not all about political correctness, per se, but that's no reason to be insensitive, right?) the links lead me to suggest that this is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek... i mean, really, dildo.com and phonesex.com? what? the last link is supposed to indicate that linux' website is no longer being maintained--but it didn't really come as a surprise to me that Linus (not Linux, as the article suggests) and his crew aren't doing a lot of work on "linox.com".)
<BR>

<BR>
incidentally, it's "virus," not "viros," microsoft doesn't have a big hand in the anti-virus industry, linux and its offspring are quite alive and well, as is the "computer security debate." at least, that's what microsoft told my dad last week when they asked him to download the patch fixing the gaping security hole in XP. (YT is still running 2000; XP looks like too much like candy)

NT stands for "New Technology", it was an OS kernel first released right after Windows 3.1 was released as a more stable 16/32 bit hybrid OS kernel from Microsoft.  It developed into version 3.5, or Windows NT 3.5, and then into Windows NT 4.0, a completely 32bit OS kernel with no 16bit support, and, the most stable and fastest Microsoft platform.  NT 5.0, or Windows 2000 as it's popularly known as came out in February 2000.  This was followed by NT 5.1, or Windows XP in October 2000.  Windows XP was also released with one of the most serious security <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q315000">flaws/exploits</a> ever heard of in the Microsoft community.

Object-oriented programming is an idea to use common components to ease the development of programs--a wonderful idea that did NOT come from Microsoft.  Visual Basic is a language that is platform-specific to Windows and is used for many functions such as simple applications and access to databases.  Visual Front Page does not exist in any form whatsoever, an application was released in mid 1998 called 'Front Page' from Microsoft and has been subsequently developed year after year since then.  It is normally regarded as an underpowered web development tool, because, that's what it is, I've learned that from personal experience.  Most professionals use <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Macromedia Dreamweaver</a>.  MFC is a library that is put out by Microsoft to ease the development of C and C++ programs.  C++ was developed in the early 1980's in an AT&T lab by Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup and was released to the general public in 1985.  An ISO committee was setup in 1994 to form a standard for the C++ language, after several drafts this standard was finally approved in 1998.

Private data members is a computer science term that means a data object, like an integer or a float, can only be accessed depending on certain heirarchy in the program.  If one part of the program 'owns' that data member, then another part can't access it.

Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds, a Finish Computer Science student because he wanted an open, freely available operating system for his computer since he was poor and could not afford commercial operating systems.  His goal created one of the best operating systems available today, and it is freely available under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"> GNU GPL</a> public liciense.

Windows in any of it's current implementations is written in completely C, C++, and the assembly language.  C++ is the most commonly used language to write applications of any type for any computer platform.  Visual Basic is what most computer viruses are written in, for it's poor 'private data member' support and for the fact that it's code is bunched into 'objects' that allow free access to the rest of the computer quite easily.  Visual Basic is also the language that Outlook and Outlook Express run on, allowing access to your address book so that viruses can easily rip through it and spread email rampantly with copies of itself.

C# (pronounced c-sharp) is new language out from Microsoft that is billed as a powerful, C++-like language with easier access to data objects and web technologies.  It is released with the rest of the .NET framework including C++ and Visual Basic.

<a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> is still around and kicking--it just released a new version--2.5.

For whoever wrote this article, I surely do hope it was a joke along with this <a href="http://home.dal.net/shrub/Adequacy_org%20%20Is%20Your%20Son%20a%20Computer%20Hacker.htm">one</a> for both are absolute bullshit.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I love the ambiguity of print. Never knowing if someone is serious or not. It's beautiful. I shouldn't read these types of articles for the same reasons I avoid movies that revise history, but I can't help myself. No matter how hard I try, they change my memory of the way things were. Pretty soon, I'll be believing that everything significant that was ever done in history was done by Americans - including the birth of Christianity.

Just remember, if it weren't for microsoft, the internet would be nothing more than a buch of university eggheads doing long distance intellectual masterbation with each other.  it is thanks to microsoft that the computer was brought to the people, out of the ivory towers.  if your jealousness of bill gateses wealth prevents you from seeing that, i feel sorry for you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I first discovered this site through a link to the article of "your sone being a computer hacker".  An article that made me laugh.  Profusely.  Thanks, for that ;p
<BR>

<BR>
But, the lack of facts in these tech articles is so profound, that I would almost call what the "tech writers" of this site are doing propaganda... but it's not because they have no hidden agendas (hah).
<BR>

<BR>
by the way, one of those links was to lunox.com and the link was supporting the supposition that linux sites were all gone... well I thought I'd try linux.com just to see, and it was there and looked to be alive and kicking.
<BR>

<BR>
The only thing I really want to clear up is this:
<BR>

<BR>
C++.
<BR>

<BR>
C++ is an extension of a language called C.
<BR>

<BR>
All C++ code could be written as C, and indeed in the olden days of C++ the first C++ compilers did nothing more than take C++ code and change it into readable C code.
<BR>

<BR>
C++ has been around long before MFC, which stands for Microsoft Foundation Classes, and is a package of C++ classes for windows which facilitates the creation of programs.  It also sucks, imo.
<BR>

<BR>
Now.  How could MFC(++) have come about before C++, if it is indeed nothing more than a bunch of C++ objects ready-made by microsoft for programmers to use?  Well.. it just couldn't have.
<BR>

I personally think AOL is the most user friendly and responsible ISP in existence. Kudos to the man who took an interest in his son's activities to keep him out of prison. I also want to emphasize that if not for those running quake we would have a much safer world!

I am so glad that you take the time out of your busy schedule to save the minds of young people.  Yes, being a highschool janitor or burger-flipping grill jockey at McDonald's is tough, isn't it Mr. Gibbons.
<BR>
Listen, before I tear into your lack of even primate level intelligence, let me first warn you to never talk about something that you obviously have no idea about.  If I were you I would avoid all human contact and put your kids up for adoption.  I pity them even more than I pity you.
<BR>
Linux makes the world go 'round.  Yes it does.  It is a completely legal operating system used widely.  It is often used as server software.  No this isn't hacker jargon (speak for you Mr. Gibbons).  A server is not evil or in alliance with the forces of Satan.  Yes, it is true.  This very webpage is hosted on a server.
<BR>
AMD processors are not manufactured by children.  They are manufactured by machines.  AMD Athlon and Duron processors have been found to be vastly superior to Intel processors in nearly every single way.
<BR>
AOL is not a good ISP.  AOL is slow, overpriced, and unreliable.
<BR>
I am not sure where you are getting your ideas from, but for the world's sake please, please kill yourself.  You, Mr. Gibbons, are a complete and total moron.  Wait, no, I don't want to insult morons.  You go beyond anything I have previously encountered.  Your parenting methods could be very damaging to your children's mental health.  Please, Mr. Gibbons, NEVER OPEN YOUR MOUTH IN PUBLIC AGAIN!

I originally thought it was an engineered joke site, but sadly it is for real. I cannot believe people like this really exist... however I guess they are entitled to an opinion.
<BR>

<BR>
My real points, and I want to strongly emphasise these, are:
<BR>

<BR>
1. If you are going to post articles learn how to spell. Can you say "Linux"?
<BR>

<BR>
2. Represent acronyms correctly. An incorrect example for GUI is "Graphical User Implementation" in the Stallman article. It should be "Graphical User Interface".
<BR>

<BR>
3. Get you history right. There are so many instances of inaccuracy in all the articles I can't even think of a good one. How about the GUI "Windows" environment. I seem to remember the Xerox labs at Palo Alto having something to do with this.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
