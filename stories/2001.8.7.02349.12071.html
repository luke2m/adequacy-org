		<p>You and I both know its all about speed. The recent movie <i>Fast and the Furious</i> has increased the interest in fast looking cars to new 
heights. 'But I cant afford that', you say. Perhaps you just inherited your parents' car, and you want to fix it up. Maybe it's a mid-nineties Civic 
or Integra. It's so lame though. It has plain paint, a lack of low profile tires, and no spoilers or neon to be seen. You need to look at this guide 
before making any of these changes. For instance, did you know that racing stripes are very effective for intimidating other drivers? Yea, I didn't 
think so. Read on for the end-all guide to having the coolest looking car on the block. </p>        </div>

<p>The very first step to making your car look like it could be the fastest thing in the world is to
<a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/hall_of_shame_5/sir.jpg">add</a> some <a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/classic/hyundai.jpg">decals</a>. 
Try and <a href="http://www.carstickers.com/cgi-local/cart.pl?db=database.txt&category=Phrases_and_Wording_Decals">find</a> a 5-foot wide one 
depicting the logo of your favourite band or of a cool saying. I know, I know, some of your favourites don't really have a 'logo', but you can 
probably get a good sign shop to write 'Brittany Spears' in 6 foot letters for you. The best place to place the inaugural logo is right in the middle 
of your back window or angled across the driver's side door. You can't put this sort of thing on the front windshield. It would look very cool there, 
but you have to remember that you must see ahead! Another good decal type is racing stripes. These actually do make your car go faster, and they look
<a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/classic/8lite-fr.jpg">really good</a> too.</p>
<p>Once you've got the logo in place, cruse down the street with the most foot traffic in your town with your windows rolled down so you can show off 
your newly stylized car. This lets people know that it there is a new car on the road, and it looks like a million dollar racer too boot. You may get 
ugly looks from other motorists with obviously inferior cars, but just make your tires squeak a bit when you pull away from the light. Don't hit the 
guy in front of you though. Simply press your breaks as hard as you can and change lanes to avoid being slowed down by the much less cool cars around 
you. You can check beside you if you want to be safe, but since your car looks so fast, no one will dare to attempt to pull past you, so you can 
change lanes in peace.</p>
<p>After that, you will want to put some <a href="http://us.f1.yahoofs.com/users/e3e39e4f/bc/EBAY+PICS/GS-R+GAUGE+GRILL.jpg?bcwUD37AdP6LxxBr">interior 
enhancements</a> in. Feel free to pretend you have a <a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/hall_of_shame_5/no-nos.jpg">nitro kit</a> too. The best 
thing to do in the interior of a super-fast car is to have a helmet near by, and get some extra seatbelt material and drape it over you every time you 
drive to make it look like you have a five-point harness. If you really want to make your car look crazy-fast, put the helmet on while waiting at red 
lights. Less amazing cars and their drivers will melt at <i>that</i> sight!</p>
<p>Next, you should install as many <a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/hall_of_shame_9/vis_civic.jpg">lighting devices</a> you can. Spotlights, 
headlights, neon, and fog lights all work, and extra credit if they don't turn off ever. This way people will notice you with greater ease, day or 
night! You have full creative freedom here. Put on headlight covers, paint the corners of your signal lights, and get those
<a href="http://beaterz.com/reviews/1199/p20_faux_type_r/civic_r_back.jpg">all-clear</a> break light covers. This is where you make your car stand 
out.</p>
<p>The most important performance-enhancing feature is yet to come, though. You need to
<a href="http://www.riceboypage.com/shame/hall_of_shame_10/pink_civic.jpg">add spoilers</a>. The bigger they are, the faster your car will look. The 
hardest part is getting them to <a href="http://beaterz.com/reviews/1199/p20_faux_type_r/civic_r_back.jpg">match your paint</a>, but most good body

Over the course of the past year he's bolted on a ridiculous red wing, splattered various stickers across his windows, and (apparently) installed some kind of aftermarket exhaust that makes the thing sound rather like a very loud dirt bike.  Fortunately, the new muffler somewhat masks the obnoxious subwoofer that he uses to announce his new Eminem purchases to the neighborhood.  The redeeming thing about ricers is that you have to believe that one day they will realize how silly they look.  To him, it might look like a "speed machine", but to me it looks like a bunch of crap screwed to a really small car that might make 140 hp on a good day.<BR><BR>

You're probably thinking of the Mustang GT.  I find the obsession that a vocal minority of people have with the Camaro to be perplexing at best .. the car is the epitome of ugly design.  Why so many people would willingly put themselves behind the wheel of what essentially amounts to an oversized doorstop is completely beyond me.  The Firebird isn't much better; Pontiac went so completely over the top in the design phase that they ended up with something that looks like it needs to be scaled down 20 times and placed in some kid's toybox.<BR><BR>

I like the Cobra because it's fun, it's fast, it turns heads, and they aren't a dime-a-dozen like the Camaros and the low and mid-end Mustangs are (mine is one out of 110.)  320 horses isn't going to destroy everything on the road, but that's not what I'm looking for.  Those are games to be played by obnoxious teenagers at stoplights. I'd rather find a lonely country road, hammer it down, and enjoy the G-forces.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

It's simply not the greatest performance platform compared with true sportscars with their monocouques, superior engine placement, and fully independent variable suspensions. I fully agree with you that the Mustang looks a shit ton better than the GM F Body cars, but what I was saying is that a $25k Z28 performs marginally better than a $32k Cobra (same 1/4 mile times but slightly better slalom for the Camaro). The one thing I do like about the F-Bodies is their scoops are functional, I find the fake scoops on the Mustangs to be kind of goofy although this is in reference to the GTs, the Cobras may have functional ones.
<BR><BR>
And I also totally agree with you on the enjoyability of windy country roads over stoplight to stoplight drag racing, but these roads are just as enjoyable in a cheap little sportscar like a Miata as in anything else. I drive an RX7 so it's obvious, with such a low tourqe/high RPM turbocharged engine, that dragging isn't my prefered method of having fun in the car. It is also fairly unique looking which surprisingly ended up being the clincher in my purchase of it over a VR4 3000GT so I do grok your preference of the Cobra thusly. And hell, all these cars have more than enough power for anybody... plenty enough to get yourself in trouble ;)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

What model years and/or options?  I was under the impression that the Z28s made between 285 and 305 BHP, depending on model year and options, but it's been a while since I've looked at any numbers  (I don't know about other add-ons like Ram Air.)  Then there's the Camaro SS, of course, which I seem to recall is somewhat more capable than the Z28.<BR><BR>

In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I'm a Mustang enthusiast and always have been, so there is a reason for my anti-F-Body bias. ;-)<BR><BR>

<i>The one thing I do like about the F-Bodies is their scoops are functional, I find the fake scoops on the Mustangs to be kind of goofy although this is in reference to the GTs, the Cobras may have functional ones.</i><BR><BR>

The Cobra scoops are functional.  I agree that the GT's are a bit silly (they're usually referred to as hood "nostrils".)<BR><BR>

The modular (96+) Mustangs actually leave themselves open to a lot of fairly easy modification.  <a href="http://www.saleen.com">Saleen</a> does a lot of work modifying stock Mustangs and re-selling them; their 1997 SR model made 600 BHP, which is an ungodly amount of power for a street car.  Obviously, they do <i>some</i> structural modifications, such as stiffening the frame, but the base vehicle is not substantially changed.  With the Cobras, you can pony up a couple of grand and bolt on a supercharger and a blower that will nicely boost you up from 320 horses or so to 480 or thereabouts (in theory, anyway.)  At that level, you could destroy pretty much any sub-Viper or sub-Euro-supercar on the road.  I have no plans to make this modification, because as you said .. there comes a point where it really just doesn't matter a whole lot anymore. :-)<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

Face the facts - US cars are now shit. Once upon a time they were advanced (50,s early 60's). Then they were silly but cool (60's, 70's). Post oil crisis theyr just shit - inferior to European & japanese models, but without the redeeming fuck-you-ness of the chrome-barge or musclecar.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hey, I'm a big fan of old English roadsters and early nineties Jappanese sportscars, but let's get real here. For less than $30k you can get an <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/camaro/index_ss.htm">American car</a> with 325HP that pulls a sub 14 quarter mile! Good fucking luck finding anything of the sort in an import. Japan doesn't even make a sporty car for the US market with 300 ponies (with the possible exception of the <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/lexus_sc430.shtml">Lexus SC430</a> which costs nearly 60k). My <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/mazda_rx-7.shtml">RX7</a> pulls a 14 flat in the quarter sure, but it cost nearly 40 grand new. That <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/subaru_impreza_wrx.shtml">WRX</a> is sweet (as is the no longer produced Evo VI and the not yet in America Evo VII), but it's gonna get dusted by a comprably priced Camaro or Mustang any day of the week. I'll trade a little handling for a lot of power any old day.
<BR><BR>
It's also interesting that of the two makes you list that produce a sub 30k car (Jag X-Type & BMW 325Ci), one is a Ford and the other produces all of 185HP (the Jag makes 240). Comparing <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/esprit.shtml">Lotuses</a>, <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/ferrari_360_modena.shtml">Ferraris</a>, and <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/lamborghini_diablo_vt_6-0.shtml">Lambos</a> to Camaros and Mustangs isn't quite a fair comparison. Compare them to <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/chevrolet_corvette_coupe-2.shtml">Vettes</a>, <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/dodge_viper_rt-10.shtml">Vipers</a>, <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/panoz_esperante.shtml">Panozes</a>, and <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/shelbys1.shtml">Shelbys</a> and you're a bit more even although the American cars still generally cost much less.
<BR><BR>
Now if we're spending 50 grand on a car, I'll take a <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/vette.shtml">Z06 Corvette</a> thanks. The only thing competitive with it, price and performance wise, is an <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/bmw_e46_m3.shtml">M3 BMW</a> and the beemer falls just short of the Z06 in every performance test (but on the plus side it has a back seat). And yes that includes the curves. The Vettes, Panozes, and Vipers rule sportscar racing at the moment and that's against far more expensive <a href="http://www.supercarstats.com/car/exotic-stats/911gt2.shtml">Porsches</a> and BMWs.
<BR><BR>
For 100 large (more than my house costs) sure, I'm going with the prancing pony. But at this point who the hell cares about performance? All I know is if I spend that kind of lucre on a car it is going to be a Ferrari.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>He's a hint, however cool you guys think these cars make you look, everyone else on the road considers you assholes.</i><BR><BR>

This seems doubtful inasmuch as I very rarely drive the car.  My main mode of transportation is an Oldsmobile Delta 98, which is not the sexiest-looking car ever assembled, but is quite comfortable and pleasant to get around in.  Am I considered an "asshole" in that?  I would guess that the majority of people that I work with don't even know I <i>own</i> a Cobra.  It spends the vast majority of its time in the garage with a protective cover thrown over it .. as a matter of fact, this year has seen an increase of just over 3,000 miles on the odometer.<BR><BR>

Of course, this kind of philosophy simply bewilders the rice-boy crowd, who spend upwards of 18 hours a day "cruising" aimlessly around town, trying to get as many people to notice the stickers they've placed on their cars to advertise non-existant performance upgrades and showing off the fake dual exhausts that they've bolted on to deal with the output from their monstrous inline four-bangers.  That is as it may be; individuals such as myself and Mr. Descartes have neither the time nor the inclination to deal with the crazed members of a rice-boy cult that worship at the altar of "perceived performance."  We'd rather have the real thing .. preferably without all of the stickers.<BR><BR>

At any rate, when I <i>am</i> driving the car, if people that I encounter happen to think that I'm an "asshole" simply because I'm behind the wheel of something beefier and more expensive than whatever it is that <i>they</i> happen to be driving, then that's <i>their</i> problem .. not mine.  I don't judge people (positively or negatively) on the basis of the cars that they drive .. if others feel the need to do so, I'm content letting them work their own issues out.  (Having said that, I do reserve the right to laugh at people who believe that slapping a "HONDA RACING" sticker on their windshield will magically add 20 BHP to their car's maximum output.) ;-)<BR><BR>

<i>I hope you enjoy your empty sexual trists commited in the woefully small backseat of whatever subpar 'sports car' you chose to drive.</i><BR><BR>

You know, lots of people have been lobbying Ford to just scrap the back seats in the higher-end Mustangs, and I would be inclined to agree with them.  They are next to useless.  Move the front seats back and give a little more leg room, and maybe make the trunk a bit bigger.  The leg room isn't all that bad (unless you're 7'0" or something like that), and you can fit a couple of sets of golf clubs in the trunk, but more room all around would be a welcome addition.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

But what's the point of having all those 'ponies under the hood' if you never (legally) have the chance to take the thing over 65-75 mph anyway?  The rice-boys are pretty annoying, but at least their driving normal cars with unremarkable power, no matter what they do to the outside.  You have all this potential that you never get to use, it's wasteful.  It's kinda like the suburban boomers who drive Hummers or Landcruisers to take the kids to soccer practice...  They're never going to drive across the Gobi or Sahara, though I guess they <i>could</i> if they had to.  You'll maybe rarely go over 70 mph, but you <i>could</i> go 100+ if you had to.

Certainly you've heard of drag strips?<BR><BR>

And then, of course, there's the prototypical Lonely Country Road, where nary a vehicle is to be seen a mile in either direction.  These are great opportunities to lay into it a little bit.<BR><BR>

However, I think your biggest misconception is "power = speed."  This is true, but it's not the whole story.  The more enjoyable aspect is "power = acceleration."  A car with sufficient power can get you from a dead standstill to 60 MPH in short order, whereas when a riceboy "tromps on the gas", it may be well into the next presidential administration before the vehicle finally hits 60.  (Stickers don't help, either.)<BR><BR>

The sad thing is that in this time of war, our way of life is under attack .. and the riceboys are squarely allying themselves with the enemy.  The American way of life is marked by excessiveness and consumerism, and these are qualities that are found in all performance car owners.  The riceboys, on the other hand, are more interested in glitz in presentation with nothing to show for it.  This is straight from the playbook of the Soviet Union and the Communist Chinese.  On May Day, these butchers paraded their ICBMs up and down Red Square, but when it came time to actually pay the piper, their "empire" collapsed.  I wonder .. do the stores that sell these morons all of their stickers also sell them American flags to wipe their asses with?  It doesn't matter.  The riceboys hate America, but as usual, the moral community will be there to bail them out.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

Some of the older children complained that the van made them feel like 'dorks' in front of their peers so I tried to spice it up a bit.  I thought it looked great, but Pastor Arnold pointed out that it may be prideful, even un-Christian, to draw such attention to yourself, and gosh darn it if he wasn't right.  It was a bit ostentatious, though the problem of what to do with it was effectively solved when I took it through the drive-thru at McDonalds to buy Shamrock Shakes for my youth group.  There was a height limit of 9 feet and the spoiler was easily 9'6".  Knocked it right off, and did $900 worth of damage to the facade too.  You may think that's funny, but the money all came out of our budget for Bibles to distribute outside of public schools, mosques and temples so the thought of all those lost souls should wipe that smirk off your face.   <BR><BR></FONT></td>

I think it's good to keep religion out of schools. Schools are for teching kids facts, not myths and other fiction.
<BR>

<BR>
Personally I get frustrated over the fact Christians so heavily want to force their belief onto others, and think of those that don't want to believe as being lesser beings. The same goes for all religions that actively spread themselves using "missionaries". 
<BR>

<BR>
A religion is a personal thing. If someone wants to believe in something they go find a suitable sect of some suitable religion. Religions should keep to themselves, and not bother the rest of the world.

Religion is a crutch. That's all it is. It used to exist to explain things that weren't understood (ie: moons, sun, stars, weather, etc). Now there is no need to explain them with some nonsensical religious ramblings.
<BR>
I don't understand how anyone with half a brain can't see through the foolishness of religion. Don't you realize that your precious Bible was just written by some guy? (or girl, or people)

Here's one last piece for you to chew on. What day is Christmas? Most people know that Christmas is December 25th. Do you know why? Of course you'll say 'because that is the day that Jesus Chris, our savior, was born'. However, that's not really true. The real reason they chose (and yes, they did indeed choose) December 25th was because that coincided with a pagan holiday at the time the Church was pushing their influence throughout Europe during the Dark Ages. Changing the name of the holiday doesn't matter much.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nobody has infinite cash, so we can't go wasting it on useless crap.  You need stuff that works; let the g**ks waste their money on widgets and doohickeys that do not a damn bit of good.
<BR><BR>
No matter what your budget is, you need to divide it up into three categories, as follows:<ul>
<li>Stuff you can see.  Graphics, aerodynamics, ground-effects, chrome, paint, lights -- you know what I mean.  Just don't blow your whole wad on this one category, because the next one is just as important...
<li>Stuff you can hear.  First and foremost, the right exhaust.  I don't even need to tell you how important that sound is.  Hang it up if you can't swing that.  Next, hi fi.  One word:  BOOM.  You know what I mean.  You don't?  Well, go watch Star Trek then.  After that, think about your horn.  You want a tune that says who you are and what you stand for.  <i>La Cucaracha</i>?  Yeah, you know it.  Dixie?   Yeah, maybe if that's you.  Fog horn?  Sure, and you can wear your Deep Space Nine uniform too!  Fuck.  Anyway, sound is all about drama. Think of the stuff you can hear as foreground, and stuff you see as background.  And what's the other category?  Oh, yeah...
<li>Stuff you can neither see nor hear.  Like what?  "Performance" chips.  Sure, like if they run Lunix even?  Right. What else?  Headers.  Boring, stroking, valve grinding, racing cams, 12 zillion CFM carbs.  Get the idea?  What most of this crap has in common is that it lives under the hood, where no one can see it.  A few things  will make your car sound a little different, but you can get the same effect with a muffler.  Turbos?  Well, you can put a scoop on your car without ever opening your hood.  The rest of the thing is all buried down in the motor, where it does you no good whatsoever.  Don't even look at the prices on this kind of stuff, either.  It will blow your budget and the only way anyone will know you have it is if they carry around a radar gun or stopwatch.   Who might that be?  The cops, for one, and the dork in the Babylon-5 t-shirt with car grease under his nails, for another.  Why you want something from one of them, I do <i>not</i> know.</ul>

So I think you should have a clear idea of the budget picture here.  Half on visual, half on audio.  But be careful with your hard-earned cash.  Once you get into the car world, you'll see ads for all kinds of stuff that doesn't do dick.  And whoo!  Expensive?  Yes, yes, ex<i>pen</i>ive!  One simple rule is that outside of your exhaust and wheels, anything you buy for this car should be able to be put on without you ever having to touch your knees to the ground.  <i>You</i> aren't the one who is going be on his knees, am I right?  Oh yes, you know I'm right!

Be sure to salt away a little extra for this overlooked but important category.  Fine leather appointments, ropey steering-wheel covers, exotic new knobs and pedals, perhaps a tasteful bit of sheepskin, and the occasional services of Asian Dream Escort.</li></ul>
Remember, you're not going to go fast until you <i>feel</i> fast.  Try something a little lacier than usual under your Phat Pharm and Fubu-- No one else will know, but boy, will you ever feel that performance boost!  Whoo!  Lacy <i>Racy</i>!<BR><BR><BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You'll just get a ticket that way, and if you are going to race on a track then we're talking about a whole other kind of car.  When you say leather feels good, I can understand that, at least.  Neon lights look good.  Phat pipes sound good.  And they work great.  But "looks fast"?  Or "feels fast"?  What the hell does that mean?  And what purpose is served by this whole "fast" business?  Because you <i>want</i> to have your license taken away?  I mean, just how fast do you need to go in the mall parking lot at 10pm on Saturday night?  Usually there's so many people walking around (i.e. checking out your ride, slick) that you can barely go 5mph.  
<BR><BR>
And "Asian Dream Escort"?  What is that all about?  If you are paying for escorts, who the hell cares what kind of car you have?  They're getting paid!  They don't care even if you drive some old green and yellow VW Bus or something.
<BR><BR>
This all reminds me of when I ask a Lunix nut <i>why</i> he is building an 8-node Beowulf Cluster in their basement.  Instead of telling me a rational reason why, the whole conversation just turns surreal and I'm sorry I even asked.

The occasional escort may be needed at first to occupy the passenger seat, to show everyone exactly what sort of preposterously attractive person you and your new vehicle deserve.  If the escort is seen touching you and being touched, then surely any potential spouse in the vicinity will realize that you've got that special something.  Asian Dream will prime the pump for you, so to speak-- before long, you will be far too busy to call, let alone make an appointment through, any escort service.
<BR><BR>
After all, nothing succeeds like success.
<BR><BR>
And a key component of success is turning the cabin of your vehicle into a tactile Xanadu, a veritable pleasure-dome of shapes and materials.  <BR><BR><BR>
