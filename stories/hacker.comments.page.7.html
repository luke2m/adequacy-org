For example Quake is perfectly legit game and might be played by hackers but doesn't mean that every one that plays it is.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I really dont know whether to take this as a joke or an insult. If it is a joke yeah good one but maybe make it a little clearer. If this isnt a joke PLEASE PLEASE RTFM and learn a little more about the world you live in. A model father does not keep such a closed door on the world that his children will learn from. Why dont you experience technology for yourself before you start ridiculously accusing your own blood of doing something I'd say your gene pool simply cannot even understand let alone become.

I'm sorry to say that you are a prime example of ignorance and lack of knowledge at work. You should be ashamed of yourself for having so little trust in your son that you refused to believe him when he was obviously telling the truth. If you are unsure, INVESTIGATE. That is what a model parent does. Comet Cursor and Flash are by NO means any type of hacker programs! If you had taken 5 minutes to famialirize yourself with these programs, you would have known that. Your other "red flags" are also foolish and completely false.
<BR>
You owe your son an apology. 
<BR>
I sincerely hope that you have not ruined the lives, and the foundations of trust, of other families by spreading this erroneous information as "fact".

<BR>
Second, you are not THE model parent.  My grandma, R.I.P., raised my mother and my aunt without a husband (my mother is almost 50).  My grandfather died when my mom was only 14 of colon cancer, my grammy didn't know how to drive, never worked a job in her life raised them into model parents.  My grandma got a job at the secretary of state, learned how to drive, and was able to afford her house for 45 years.  She also played a big part in my life.  She taught me how to write cursive before I attended first grade, taught me how to read before preschool, and taught me self love.  If you want to be a model parent look at people who have raised their kids to be intellegent adults under hard circumstances.
<BR>

<BR>
Last, your kids will probly result into the type of child who shoots up their high school, or kill themselves.  Sorry to say it, but your the opposite of a model parent.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
First note: Internet Idiocy. Do you really expect to believe anything found in the 'Internet Idiocy' section of a website?
<BR>

<BR>
Second note: Wife - Carol. Daughter - Cindy. Son - Peter. Six children in the household. If you still haven't recognised these obvious allusions to The Brady Bunch, then I feel sorry for you. As much as I despise them, I still recognise the names.

Many teens use the internet to become involved socially with people expressing similar views. There are many newsgroups forums and mailing lists you can become active in. Also there are other Operating Systems other than windows while they look and run differently they are much the same. Linux and others are more reliable and flexible for those who have experience in programing and while you may not know how to use them your child might. Not only that but evn Windows can be used in hacking activities. Programming is actually an available course in most high schools and you can always contact their teachers if you want to ask any questions about any software and/or hradware they are using. Of course your child should ask before downloading and installing such software but try to be understanding and express your fears to them. Also hardware upgrades are sometimes a necessity. Newer programs including games and programs for creating 3D artwork and movies. Quake is actually a very popular first person shooter and while the messaging system can be abused as described above so can just about any other online game that incorporates a messaging system. While AOL is a highly recomended internet service provider that doesn't mean that others are not. There are many that are provided by telecomunication companies. And finally while staying on the computer for long periods of time is not recommended there is certainly no such thing as "Computer Radiation". But there are other thing including eye fatigue wich can result in nausia and headaches. The easiest way to prevent this is every hour or so take a short break. And just to reinterate don't jump to conclusions!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

  actualy there is one bit of information I would like from the author of this article.  he said he did research in order to come up with this method of detection, I personaly would like to see what comic book he used, because anyone with the computer literacy of a 6 year old can find that the nature of the artical although written with the best intentions was completely lacking in factual information. if I had turned this in as a school assignment when I was in school I believe I would have faild miserably, unless it was a fiction assignment.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

However, if that persons son was going to steal credit card #'s and such, then by all means ban him form his one trusted friend his COMP! B/C it is his only friend! You as parents hsould be ashamed of yourself it was your fault he became a hacker anyway. Its B/C you didnt do your damn parenting job! And since when is Flash, comet cursor and bonzai buddy hacking software. ill tell you when-NEVER! Flash is used to make cool animated cartoons, Comet Cursor gives you custom cursors for your comp, and Bonzai buddy- its usless crap made by someone who had way too much time on their hands! As for the dress change in a person- think you idiots, most hackers are over the age of 12 and go to high-school, yes high-school! And what do people do in high-school- they strive to fit in with other people and/or groups and make friends,<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I've been using computers since I was 13 years old - Let me just ply you with a little advice - 
<BR>

<BR>
The programmes you have mentioned in your article are *NOT* hacking programmes.  For one, you mention LUNIX - which is a operating software for the Commodore 64 (I'd like to see you do any hacking on one of those!)  Linux, on the other hand (hard to believe the difference two of those little letters make) is a reliable operating system, mostly used for programming new software - again (NOT HACKING!).  
<BR>

<BR>
You should have let your kid continue to learn PERL and Linux - you could have been sitting on a veritable FORTUNE having a computer programmer in the family (and I *do* mean through legal jobs  for illustrious companies such as Microsoft, Electronic Arts, et. al. and not hacking, before you confuse the two).

I work for Apple Computer as a lead programmer on some of their projects, and I hack all the time. What does hacking mean? It means making a program (or even stuff in the Real World) do things that they are not originall intended to do or looking at things originally not intended to be seen upon. Me opening ResEdit and then looking at a text file on my computer is me hacking. Me editing a file so that I can use MineSweeper as a working clock is me hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
As for programs...
<BR>
Flash: this is using to create webpages, made by Macromedia, Inc. I respectable, multi-billion  dollar company.
<BR>
Linux: This is available to buy in stores such as Best Buy. Would Best Buy be selling hacking stuff? No!

1. WTF? Don't be stupid. If your son was a hacker he wouldn't be stopped by AOL.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Ok this is the stupidest thing you said. Comet Cursor integrates new cursors onto websites. Bonzi Buddy is an assistant on the computer. Flash is for websites that incorporate Flash media.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Faster video cards improve performance visually of the computer. It has NOTHING to do with hacking, genius. Hard drives are the things you use to store your stuff! Without a hard drive your computer could not run. Gah you're stupid. HAHA this is another stupid one. AMD is a very respectable processor manufacturer that competes directly with Intel.
<BR>

<BR>
4. This one actually made sense, but it is fucking common sense smart one! If your kid is reading hacking manuals then yeah there is a small chance he/she is a hacker. Idiot.

<BR>
5. 30 fucking minutes on the computer per day??? I can spend more than 2 hours a day on the computer easily and I'm not a hacker. Conservative assholes.

6. Quake is a fucking game. Calm down. There are plenty of other first person shooters.

<BR>
7. This can happen with anyone, hacker or not.

8. IDIOT! LINUX is a very stable operating system trusted by many businesses corporations. It is not hacking software or anything.

You may as well go cannibalistic on your children, and never, ever, breed again. While you're at it, go cannibalistic on yourself, I'd like to see you chomp your <b>little</b> testicles off :P

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I have used computers for years and there is nothing on that list that is true.
<BR>

<BR>
Parents don't listen to this man. Most computers use flash and it is a simple tool for displaying graphics on the net.
<BR>

<BR>
Let me change your list so it, is true.
<BR>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use slow Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict i-like-to-be-Hacked policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is slow, boring and above all legal(way boring you off the internet). If your child is becoming a gamer, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more gamer friendly provider. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would advise all parents to follow this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's slow speed. This speed is vital to any parent who wants their son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him to bordem. It is best to move ISP's, rather than using AOL. 
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Sub 7", "Brutus" and "Morphious"(but there is also a good music downloader called morphious). 
<BR>

<BR>
The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs.  
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer gamers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by  buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. Or for a cheap solution go to a computer store. You get the same service(cheap prices)
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for excitment. AMD is a first-world based company who make supior American processor chips. They use well-paid workers extensively in their first world factorys, . AMD chips are always sold in stores, or you may order them from internet sites. Do  buy this chip! This is one request that you must give your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. 
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
I removed this because, it was the worst piece of rubbish ive seen.
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
So was this
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by gamers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss gaming and train in the use of various V.R. weapons. Some gamers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world.(this is possiable) 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is  acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away(you should anyway), and have trigger locks installed. 
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
This is called "teenage years"
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
Please rubbish again.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
This person is either mad or has come into contact with people outside the house.(you should do that)
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>

If your son is trying to become a hacker limiting his acces to your home computer wont stop him it is more likely to incorage him. As far as comet cursor and bonzai buddy being hacking tools..lmao
<BR>
Yes thats what all the real hackers use these days. Why use a sniffer or a scanner when you can make really cool cursors?
<BR>
I doubt your son is a hacker and from what youve stated he probably is not trying to be a hacker.
<BR>
I seriously suggest that before you punish your children for more "cyber-crimes" you educate yourself. By the way reading a FAQ or two doesnt count as being educated.
<BR>
By the way that "lunix" as you put it is a free operating system based on unix technology it far more stable than any of the crap that windows puts out. As far as being illegal well i guess thats why you can get "lunix" at any major computer store.

<BR>
Frankly, I'm disturbed by this obviously uneducated writing. First, for the reason I just stated above. Let me make a few corrections...
<BR>

<BR>
-Flash isn't a program. It's a language. It's used in web design and is one of the best known for multimedia presentations over the internet.
<BR>

<BR>
-The "changing their appearance" factoid is confusing hackers with "ravers", two completely different social groups which sometimes cross over. Most of the time, however, you will not find two more opposite groups. Ravers are extroverts, party people, individuals who love to be visible. Hackers are introverts in the real world, mostly leaving the socializing to the cyber-world.
<BR>

<BR>
-If Quake can train people on the use of firearms, then playing baseball on my computer will get me ready for Spring training with the Yankees. 
<BR>

<BR>
-AMD Proccessors are sold by Gateway, Dell, Compaq, and Hewlett Packard, just to name a few. 
<BR>

<BR>
I could keep going, but it's useless, i doubt the writer of this is going to ever listen to the other side of this narrow-minded story.

<BR>

<BR>
A) He is not an enlightened modern parent. 
<BR>
B) Cindy is merely fibbing.
<BR>
C) AOL and Prodigy etc etc... there is NO HACKER SUPPORTED ISP. No ISP in their right MINDS support Hackers. Hacker Friendly ISPs? You realize the ISP gets in trouble too.
<BR>
D) Flash... Flash..&gt; FLASH IS NOT A HACKER PROGRAM YOU FOOL. Flash is a program much like Java but for display purposes. It has VERY little durability for hacking.
<BR>
E) Hardware. Okay do you know what Hacking is? What does a VIDEO card have to do with hacking? The most hardware YOU need for hacking is more bandwith. THERES NOTHING ELSE. Sound Card Video Card? WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HACKING?
<BR>
F) Programming with Perl. PERL IS NOT A HACKING UTILITY YOU HYPOCRITE. You listed Hacking Utilities yet you failed to mention Perl. Perl is an online scripting language used primarily for database purposes. 
<BR>
G) Hacker CrackDown is a Hacking manual.. Someone tell me the logic.
<BR>
H) Quake is a game. You shoot people. Theres nothing hackish about it.
<BR>
I) What does behavior have to do with hacking..
<BR>
J) Lunix... what is Lunix? You mean linux? I think YOUR a Lunix! Linux is an OS, Lunix? Lunix is YOU YOUR A LUNIX.

AOL is the most sucky internet provider you can have

reading Hacking manuals can be for educational purposes

QUAKE?? sorry but thats an computer game :) biggest nonsence posted on this site
<BR>

<BR>
linux you microsoft whores... pfffft linux is a good operating system I use both but linux is for exploring and it doesn't crash as often as windows.
<BR>

<BR>
and if you want to become a hacker you must be REALLY smart I don't hack but I just fiddle around with the pc alot and I have top notch grades at maths and such. (also great for english :) )
<BR>

<BR>
LINUX IS NOT ILLEGAL you fuck it's freeware that doesnt make it illegal. damn u r dumber than a horses ass :/
<BR>

<BR>
and about christian stuff.... I don't like the idea of god influencing ppl in their doings. I won't believe in god untill I'm dead and actually have seen him/her/it (if it exists) and the believe in god has only made things go for the worst in this world withouth the invention of god mankind would have probbably gotten further in other directions. ALL WARS AND CONFLICTS ARE BASED ON RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OR TRIGGERD BY THEM. OR USE RELIGION AS AN EXCUSE TO DO THINGS! I hate ppl who cry out that everything that's anti-christ is evil those ppl should be locked away or atleast think (FOR THEM SELFS AND NOT CHECK IN A BOOK IF ITS A GOOD THING TO SAY IT) themselfs.
<BR>

<BR>
Russian inventors are evil MUWHAHAHAAAA yeah right if an american christian person invented linux or unix (or lunix for the dopes out there) it wouldn't be an "illegal hacker operation system" 
<BR>

<BR>
"They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this)" uuuh yeah right stupidity strikes again most ppl that I know that look like that are not hackers and dont have the slightest idea of what a computer is and what it does and can do. Judging ppl by appearance is SO wrong. and note that hackers don't want to be identified U CAN NOT GROUP HACKERS. Hackers don't have to have psychopathic stuffs or whatever.

First of all, programming is a very vital and integral part of our world as of today. Second of all my grades in school have risen since becoming what you consider a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
I do not have a problem with your concerns, but you need to understand that there is hacking, (Computer exploration and advancement, as well as programming) and cracking, (Illegal theft of programs, passwords, and accounts). Hackers are basically the people who defend the ignorant masses from their unscrupulous counter-parts. If your CHILD (Son or Daughter since I know a lot of girls who are much better at hacking than me)is programmingg, not only should you be unconcerned but even encourage him, or her. While if they are malicously destroying other peoples computers without there consent, I think you should set them straight about what is legal. I suggest getting a hackers point of view at www.happyhacker.org, Carol Meinel. Although I dont always agree with her, she is goodhearted about informing the masses about true hacking.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

I do not know how to hack computers but I have learned some slight information on videogame hacking (i.e. Gameshark or Game Genie).
<BR>

<BR>
I have know a couple computer hackers.  None of them wear bright colors or any of that sort of description under topic 9(nine).  The people that I know who have done that sort of thing are people who do drugs or go to raves (my sister has done this).
<BR>

<BR>
I don't know if Bonzi Buddy and Comet Cursor can be used to hack with, but I know they are not intended for that use.  Bonzi Buddy is a stupid little purple ape that you can make say things you type in whereas Comet Cursor is labeled as spy-ware.

That's all I have to say.  Please listen to it and possibly make changes or respond to me and tell me why you think I am wrong.  You can reach me at my e-mail aland007@hotmail.com It is not my main address but I will check it often since I put it here.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So if your going to write something know the facts. 2nd Linux is not an illegal operating system it is a freeware os or you can buy a boxed version at a computer store. It's most popular use is by internet servers. 3rd Comet Curser just changes the apperance of the mouse on the screen, Bonzi Buddy is a AI or artificial inteligence program that is a little monkey that comes on the screen and talks to you Flash alows you to make animations. None of the programs are used for hacking, your a moron for thinking so. 4th any true hacker or cracker is smart in math and science not stupid like your son. 5th hacking is not illegal as long as you dont break into a system. And it's not dangerous. Again your stupid.

On the two that I don't fit, radical change in appearance, and reading hacking manuals, those are still NOT criteria for being a hacker. Neither are the other eight. You are probably quite computer illiterate. You don't have enough knowledge about computers. What kind of talk is this about Quake? You are one of the most ignorant people I have known to date, even out scoring my own parents. They know what quake is, my father has played it. I suppose Half-Life is the hacker eliteist society? All us gen-x'ers want to do is have a little fun, we do it in other ways than you. We chat and play games online with people halfway around the world. If that ain't something awesome enabled by technology, I don't know what is. Many children in their teens don't even have half the knowledge I do about computers, and I still have no clue about hacking whatsoever. Your instance seems quite isolated, I suggest you rethink what your son was really up to. Your hacking signs are just futile attempts to justify yourself, a typical grown-up tactic.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I have never seen a more ignorant person than this asshole. He thinks that Comet Cursor, Bonzi Buddy and Flash are HACKER programs?! AMD chips are BAD?! Novels about hacking are DANGEROUS?! QUAKE IS HARMFUL?! and "LUNIX" he cant even spell right, that dumbass.

You certainly cannot tell a hacker going by appearance and dress.  You claim "linux", "bonzi buddy" and "comet cursor" are all dangerous hacking utilities and can cause serious damage to ones machine. Guess what, your wrong again.  Your son and his quest for knowledge of the fastest growing market ever to hit this world as we know it, the computing market.  Believe it or not but your son was actually spending his time educating himself for the future.  He will probably grow up still interested in his feild of computers and have to support you because you think if you are on the computer for more than 30 minutes you could be "dosing" someone.  You obviously have not ventured into computers very much and made a horrible mistake by taking your son out of this interest of his.  Your son is a bright young man who realizes the importance of computers and the evergrowing demand for knowledge and skills.  You should take this into conisderation and allow your son to continue his learning experience.  You can monitor his activities by simply applying applications that log keystrokes (which i think is a complete invasion of privacy but for someone as ignorant as yourself it may be a resort).  Talk to your son about his activities, chances could be hes not even "hacking" as you see it.  Also the "Quake" being an allegid hacker hangout.  Who and what told you that?  Quake is a game, a really entertaining one at that.  Just because the game involves combat doesn't mean your son is going to grab a gun and blow someones head off.  If your son ever does then it is your fault as a parent and an issue you refused or never knew to take care of.  Take this whole comment into consideration and also lighten up.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

1st off, the retoric that you posted/spewed in the is you son a hacker is utter crap.  Where is your information from?  
<BR>
Pacifiers worn around their necks (that ravers not hackers) 
<BR>
Linux created by the Russians?
<BR>
AMD processor...the processor has absolutly nothing to do with security, and it has been around as long as the pentium has moron.  As for sweat shops...please how is a 5year old kid suppose to make a fucking computer chip??????
<BR>
Quake? Are you serious...you were talking about hacking not the trench coat mafia
<BR>
Surly antisocial behaviour...can you say teen years...after being reaised in the opression that you are raising your kids who wouldn't be surly
<BR>
Changing their appearance....uhhh again due to the teen years, kids are geared towards conformity one they hit teens so they tend to dress alike, I am sure that you have seen it at the mall right.
<BR>

<BR>
you are a fucking moron if you think that these views of your are correct, and anyone who reads this...if you read it...and think that these are true signs that your child is a hacker then maybe you shouldn't have children.
<BR>
Changing ISP's?  I would change from AOL as well, seeing how they are the least sophisticated of all ISP's.  Java anyone... I thought not

All the software and hardware you mention in your article are in themselves harmelss(in the case of bonzi buddy irritating but harmless nonetheless)Linux is a VERY powerful operating system, with power comes responsobility. Removing linux does NOT require had disk replacement.you sir were the victim of an unscrupulous technican. I'm not familiar with AOL as an ISP so i can't comment on that aspect of your uneducated article. As for the chip maker AMD thier chips are top quality devices , equal to and in some respects better than the same parts from intel. I'm going to send this post before it degenerates to the point of a "flame war" if you want to know what that is "surf the web" to find out ... but whatever you do DO NOT MODIFY YOUR SYSYEM IN ANY WAY IF YOU DO YOU ARE A HACKER!!!!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I found this article to be very informative.  I mean, until now I was under the impression that my copies of L0phtcrack, CrackerJack and Claymore were the way to go.  However, due to the enlightening text I have just digested, I realize that I need to secure a copy of Flash and purchase a book on Perl programming in order to achieve true "Hacker" status.  I will also be going to the mall where I will purchase some bright colored clothing and of course the pacifier...because any good cracker knows they need a pacifier.  When I read dribble like this, it almost makes me feel pity for other parents and people who read things like this and do not know better.  So they accept about 50% of what was said and are now propagating the same BS to others.  As an IT professional, I resent morons like Mr. Gibbons.  He needs to watch every segment of Boot Camp in its entirety and read a quality text like Maximum Security or one of the Hacking Exposed books.  This is assuming he can read.  I will be honest, anyone who thinks that a furry purple ape hopping around a desktop is a tool for gaining privileged access is an idiot. In conclusion, we are all now a bit dumber for having read his submission of English literary excrement.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Just because he doesnt understand them fdoesnt mean they are bad.  Quake is a simple game.  Yes its gorry but i assure you hackers do not only hang out in that gam,e.  YEs it is fun for youth but it is just that ....FUN!  Another thing...hackers come in all shapes and sizes and colors.  We do not look alike and anyone who stereotypes all hackers into one group is ignorant.  AMD is a respectable company and this mans harsh words need to be retractred.  HAlf of the info in this article is based on his ignorance and gullibalness.  If his naevity is not being over exxagerated in this article then he is not mature enough to be a parent and his family (as a result) cannot be perfect....SORRY!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You mean to tell me that since I have an ADSL line and use Earthlink as my ISP that I am a hacker?  Ummmmmm....tick tick tick tick....&lt;BUZZER SOUND&gt; WRONG!  That means nothing!
<BR>

<BR>
And to stay with AOL?  Don't make me laugh.  JESE!  Everyone knows that AOL is the worst provider on the face of this planet.
<BR>

<BR>
Changing ISPs?  Yea right.  Could it possibly be the fact that the ISP you currently have sucks?
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor and Bonzi Buddy labeled as hacking programs?  YEA RIGHT!  More like SPYWARE!
<BR>

<BR>
Asking for new hardware.  Thats normal.  It is in our very human nature to want more power.
<BR>

<BR>
Reading hacker manuals?  Hey, knowledge is power, knowledge is gold.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake as a hacker meeting ground?  Don't make me laugh.  It is just a game for crying out loud.
<BR>

<BR>
And they misspelled Linux.  So a person uses Linux.  Let them, more power to them.

Filter are not vital to any parent who wants their child to enjoy the internet and filter can even block of good sites. 
<BR>
2. Just because you have software you don't remember installing does not mean it is hacker software, it could be games or stuff for school.
<BR>
3 Has your child asked for hardware is the most brain dead thing I have ever heard of. Maybe the child does not want 10-year-old hardware that can't be use with new game, Microsoft software, and educational software. 1gb hard drive won't hold much legal software. A new cpu would make the computer run faster. About AMD I'm just speechless about how stupid you would have to be if you think people would be leave what he was talking about in that paragraph. 
<BR>
5. Spending time on the computer is not a bad thing. Just because they are one the computer does not mean they are hacking computes. Maybe they are in a chat room. 
<BR>
7.Teenagers are going through a lot of changes emotionally so and doing what he said to do will only make it harder for them. 
<BR>
8. Lunix is spelled Linux to start. He has no idea what he is talking about and is just trying to scare you.
<BR>
9.Teenager do that to fit in and be cool, it does not mean he is a hacker. 
<BR>
10.The child may just want to be cool. Maybe they find school work boring and a waste of time.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">you all are idiots. the original article was about how to tell if your child is hacking. first of all, the article is probably a satire, or sarcastic joke. not that there arent stupid people in this world that could be that ignorant and misinformed, because there definately are. i say its probably a joke because a lot of it just seems to be too "silly." if the "father" had done research or even looked at the programs like bonzi buddy he would know what it is. he would also know where and who linux and its derivatives really came from. in another words it sounds like the guy is making stuff up. you cant find out about how linux destroys sections of your harddrive, when deleted or uninstalled, by searching for "lunix." second, the post suggesting that the "father" beat his child is meant to be sarcastic. i think its obvious that its making fun of the father for his ignorance. if you can't see that then i think it is you that may be in trouble.
<BR>

<BR>
in short, dont call the child abuser an asshole, its far more probable that it is a sarcastic comment meant to show the absurdity of the article, than the poster actually suggesting that the "father" should beat his children. the father does talk about spanking because his child is supposedly a hacker. how old do you think the child is? and the "father" is contemplating spanking him?
<BR>

<BR>
you all need to learn to take and recognize a joke
<BR>

<BR>
do you think jonathan swift really thought elderly people and children should be eaten to feed the rich?

Bonzi buddy is hacking software?  I am more worried about the parent than the child.  AMD remove safeguards for hacking?  What the hell have we been smoking?

Adult content on the internet is unavoidable and AOL (your big brother) won't help you!  Sheesh, may you're a big government supporter - want someone to look after you.

Linux was produced by communists?  Paranoia setting in.

I have never seen such a hilarious post.  This reminds of parents who protested dungeons and dragons when I was young - they all thought we were devil worshippers.  In the end, I hacked on my old Apple computers, played D&D, watched and LOVED War Games, finished higher education and am employed at Air Defense Command...LOL...kidding.

You are the type of person who is afraid of change. You are the type of person who is so insecure that you have to force everyone into conformity with your views. You are a disgrace to human race. God created man with free will. God gave us children to love and nurture, not lock up and control every thought they have. You are the type of parent who produces mindless zombies. I went to college with students who had parents like you! They were so controlled by their parents at home, that when they got away from home finally, they went over the edge partying! It is one thing to inform a child and help mold them, it is entirely another thing to bind up their brain so only you can shape it!
<BR>

<BR>
P.S.  People like you are why I sometimes think that you should have to get a license to have children...to prove you are not such an idiot.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

And just so u dont sound like a complete dumb ass when u write future hacking articles, quake is a game (cannot be used to hack), Flash is used to create animation (not a real threat, ive never heard of some one getting hacked watching a garfield cartoon), oh (*laughing so hard it hurts*) comet cursor is definetly NOT a hacker program (it is used as a way for people to display special cursor on thier web page)
<BR>
So as you can see your son is probably not a hacker. Before you try to be smart and post an article that has so many differnent side to it read a little and actually research each point you try to make before you make a complete ass out of your self.
<BR>
Oh and Peter hang in there because despite what some people say "Ignorance is a bliss", your father is keeping you from participating in a multi million dollar market.

The claims that "Programming with Perl" should be banned from book stores, AMD processors are evil as they're made outside the US, that Bonzi Buddy and Flash are "hacker" software are ridiculous.  You're mad, completely insane.  No wonder your kid denied that he's a hacker.  I have news for you - HE'S NOT!!!
<BR>

<BR>
How paranoid can one person be?  Do you happen to live in a trailor somewhere and lead a militia or something??  I bet you have your own bunker and your very own arsenal too!!  Have you been on Jerry Springer before?  This is the type of ignorant, uneducated person that you're coming across as and you are being laughed at.  I can't believe that people like you still exist?
<BR>

<BR>
Please, please, please, please get a life and read up on the software that you think is "hacker" software to see what it does.  I could tell you but I don't have the time for ignorance of such magnitude.
<BR>

<BR>
There are plenty of kids who were the same clothes as your son that don't know how to switch on a computer, let alone hack!
<BR>

<BR>
Linux was not invented by a "Soviet hacker".  Why don't you get your facts right before trying to hang someone??  Linux was invented by Linus Torvalds who in fact is from Finland and developed the operating system so that people all over the world can use it and develop software for it for free.
<BR>

<BR>
Being interested in Linux means that he knows about other operating systems, especially when it comes to the internet.  Next thing you'll be saying that Apple Mac operating system was invented by Martians and that the Sun Solaris operating system was created in some sweat shop in Asia and they're all coming together to overthrow the human race!
<BR>

<BR>
Sort yourself out and don't write anything else until you do some research.  Having second or third hand information from people who don't know what they're talking about isn't research.  You have an internet connection, I suggest you use it and educate yourself before you condemn others, especially your son.

Bonzi Buddy is a hacking software could someone please show me how to use it because as far as I know it is just an annoying downloaded assistant, that most people delete right after they download.

AMD is just another CPU designer these chips are cheaper and generally less powerfull than Intel chips, but they are not Intel Knock offs that are used for Hacking, that concept is just ridiculous.

Poor old MS DOS, DOS or Disk Operating System is an old command driven single user operating system and speaking of missused terms, The name of the operating system is Linux not Lunix and it is bassed on unix, Telnet is a program that has been with Windows for many years now and is used to connect your computer as a dumb terminal to a remote host, but I am not saying anything that a educated computer user would not know.

Idiocy is present in your article, you should look up the various topics before you start judging. "LINUX" properly spelled, is not a hacker O.S. but simply not a mainstream commercial O.S., and is actually better. AMD is not a third world "copy" of american chips.AMD happens to make processors that are less expensive, but are much faster and more powerful than "top of the line" pentiums. As for more ram and hard drive space, this is a common want by computer users, and is not what you make it out to be at all. Quake is a video game, not a hacker training playground, and anyone who knows anything about hacking will laugh at you. The other programs you have mentioned are harmless, and should also be looked over.Please, dont make blind claims in the future, for you know not what you are talking about.Hacking is not illegal.It is used for an educatonal experience, and is used to find holes in security in your system, to correct them.Cracking is illegal and is clearly shunned upon in the hacking world.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

1)  You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.  The programs you have associated as *hacking* programs.. it's ludicrous and completely WRONG.  I mean, c'mon.. "Comet Cursor?" LOL!
<BR>

<BR>
2)  If you are going to make a big stink about hackers, then get your information straight before you post crap like this.
<BR>

<BR>
3)  Go to a spelling and grammar class.

4)  If this page is indeed meant for humor, you definately made me laugh a hell of a lot..lol

If u would think for a little while instead of shoting off ur damn toung u would know that flash comes from a company named macromedia.now if flash was illegal don't u think that the founder of the company would be behind bars. last but not least i would like to say that these are the kinds of people who give white hat hackers a bad rep. and as for ur kids they need to say far away from u as possible and u need to go and see a shrenk.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

When under the influence of this drug, some people tend to grind their teeth, causing possible major dental problems. If your kid regularly wears a pacifier, its probably because he's on DRUGS (A MUCH bigger problem than a 'hacker'). Good luck.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Kids who work on there car all the time doesn't mean that they are out drag racing all the time, it just means that they have a found a way to express themself.  I think that this article is nothing more than fear of what is to come.  Computers are becoming more and more present in the world today and I think that  people are just not ready to accept it.  This is nothing more than the Salem Witch Trials again.  People are so scared that they point fingers at kids who they don't understand just so they can sleep at night.  I know that you are probably just going to go and say I am nothing more that a hacker trying to protect others, but I say that I would rather be a hacker than someone who is simply pushing blame.

A few of these reasons were legitimate, such as the ones about hacking books or programs. But some of the other ones were so fucking stupid i am dying of laughter. For one, AMD chips are NOT products of child labor and infact outpreformed the american based intel chips in the benchmark tests. Another fairly stupid one is limiting ur childs use on the computer. Computers are the wave of the future and people are going to have to get used to being on them all day. 2 more points please, Quake is NOT a hacker breeding grounds. Quake is nothing more than a computer game, a first person shooter as a matter of fact. THere is no harm in playing these games at all, whoever the dumbass is who wrote this is just assuming that it is where hackers meet becuase a large majority of hackers tend to like the game, but the game has NOTHING to do with hacking at all. and lastly the part about LINUX. i almost wanted to die of laughter when i heard about this. Linux is an operating syste. and nothing more. MANY servers use it as it is more reliable than windows ever will be. it just doesnt crash, so many people, especially ones who dont play many games, run it on their computers so they dont crash. Now i know most people probably wont listen to this... but i want to tell the author of that that he is a dickhead dumbass who doesnt know a shit about what he is talking about. thanks for takign the time to read this<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You play online games YOUR A HACKER! You like the linux operating system YOUR A HACKER. You use the computer too much because you have no friends becuase you use the computer too much YOUR A HACKER. You make animations YOUR A HACKER.  You dress funny YOUR A HACKER. If they play quake hide the firearms!!! Look quake is a game where you kill virtual people like a lot of games and  I admit you should be careful but if your child doesn't know the difference between fantasy and reality then you didn't raise him right. Flash is an animation tool used by lots of professional web animators. To my knowledge flash does not have any destructive powers(to my knowledge). And about software you don't remember installing, maybe the computer came with but even if your kid did install it don't assume its bad. In most cases its completely harmless. I'm not saying don't be suspicious but ask your kid what it is before deleting what could be something going toward his future carreer and on his resume. Sometimes kids even write their own programs and applications.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway, those kiddies, might want to realize that this is satire, no moron could possibly be this stupid.  (I actually believed it was a serious article at the begining, maybe the result of terrible research, but after reading techTV's link it became pretty clear this was infact satire.)

(And not the funniest serious discussion ever)

Unfortuneately this is not the case.. This is infact a satire.

With my experience, I can honestly say that this article is very inaccurate. First of all, Quake is STEREOTYPED with hackers (there are TONS of hackers who do not play this very out-dated game). Second, Flash is a program designed for PROFESSIONAL VECTOR GRAPHICS, not hackers. A child learning Flash could become a very wealthy website designer. Hacking most likely does not come from using Flash. I am not a hacker (I love Flash), but I have acquaintances who are. In reading this article, it did not describe any of them. I can remember when they embarked in their hacking lifestyle, and they did not fit any of these 10 possible descriptions (except maybe playing Quake, b/c that is an old game =P). Anyone that is looking for decent advice should consult elsewhere to find better facts about hacker lifestyles and "symptons".
<BR>

<BR>
And as an aside, learning security (aka - hacking) can lead to many high-paying professional careers. With the know-how to break in can also lead to the know-how to design systems to STOP hacking. Keep that in mind when you think your kid is "breaking the law" of the Internet.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
First of all Quake is a not a virtual reality realm where hackers gather and are trained. If it was more than half of teenage boys are hackers. Quake is a first person shooter, one of the best out there fyi. It can be played in the single player mode offline or teamplay mode online. Most of what happens in teamplay is gaming. There are very few game servers who even allow anything that would suggest hacker training.
<BR>

<BR>
Next comes the deal of what yoou call "Lunix". It's not a hacker-only operating system. First of all, as I am sure you've heard enough of by now, is that it is Linux, not Lunix. Linux IS a more powerful OS(operating system) that will not harm your computer in any way, shape, or form (unless there is a hardware compatibility conflict). You make it sound so evil. Some of your most secure (and hard to hack) internet servers of your big internet companies run on Linux. Plus to show it's not just used by hackers, over 60% of the movie "Shrek" was made by computer rendered graphics on Linux machines.
<BR>

<BR>
On the line of hardware requests, I hope you didn't come down to hard on your son about this. Depending on when you got your computer, you could really save some money by upgrading now instead of buying a new syatem later. Upgrading memory is one of the best ways. You're internet connection is faster, and shockwave games or movies download faster (in fact anything that uses temporary memory will run faster).You can get another 128 MBs for about $20. Next comes the issues of AMD chips. They are more powerful than any other chip. The new AMD running 1.67 GHz performs just as good or better than the new Intel Pentium 4 running 2.2 GHz on benchmark tests. New hardrives are also a goog investment since most computer hardware prices are at an all time low. You can get a 40 GB hardrive for about $70. Video and graphics cards aren't used for hacking and I'm pretty darn sure there is no way it can be. It improves computer graphics on video games and allows you to do video editing, which if your son becomes good at, he can make some serious money out there on the job market. One of the best you can get thats always close to home is a local television station.
<BR>

<BR>
 Next comes the issue of changing ISPs. This can be used to point out hacking, BUT a local ISP is usually faster and connecting can to less than half the time it does on AOL. AOL, while good for those who are new to the internet or have no local ISP, lacks the capabilities you have with a local ISP. AOL doesn't allow you to do certain things that you can do in Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. When it comes to security you can download things such as netnanny or cyberwatcher to do just as good if not a better job than AOL's features.
<BR>

<BR>
One thing I must complain about, and I really do hate to complain, is over your use of describing behavior and dress changes. If you will notice, must teenagers do rebel or become a little angry at their parents during puberty. Dress changes you stated are ridiculous as well. If you haven't noticed baggy jeans are the "in" or "cool" clothes to wear. I would only see the extra-baggy wide-legjeans that look like they are as wide at the ankle as they are at the waist and a selection of only black clothes. As for techno music, you really need to look into it. Techno isn't a bad form of music that only hackers listen to. My 52 year old teacher, who will remain unnamed, loves the stuff. He bought a Macintosh system and started mixing techno beats and playing what he mixes in class during extra class time (like after we finish a test and have 20 minutes left in class). It gets a bad stereotype from the fact that it is played at "rave parties" where ecstasy, PCP, and other drugs are very popular. People like it because it's fun to dance to and has a futuristic sound to it. You don't have a certain dance style you see in other music like you see in ballroom dancing. You just start dancing and have a good time. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now that thats over with, lets talk about programs you don't remember installing. I have done this and my mom got concerned, I showed them what they are, what they do, and how to use them. She doesn't really have a problem now. I download games and system utilities that are either free or shareware. Don't get to concerned. Research the program yourself and scan it for viruses. Som of the things you had above were Flash put out by Macromedia and Comet Cursor. Comet Cursor is used on your system as a system utility to manage your pointing devices. It got on my computer when I installed a new pointing device ( a scroll mouse I got at CompUSA ). Flash info can be found at www.macromedia.com.
<BR>

<BR>
Now you talked in your article about your daughter running up to you and saying your son is a hacker. This doesn't suprise me. My little brother blamed me of it because he was upset, we later found out, because I had more computer time than him. I have been accused of it just because I have a cable internet connection (256k) and know a lot about computers. 
<BR>

<BR>
I plan on installing Linux on an old computer that I fixed. I am not a hacker, never have been, and never will be. If i can learn Linux well, learn how to set up servers with it, and network computers; I can earn up to $60,000 a year. 
<BR>

<BR>
My advice about your son is simple. Either by a new PC and give him the old one and let him play around with Linux on it or get him one that is older and slower one for about $300-$500 and let him play around with it. MONITOR HIM THOUGH!!! If he learns how to repair or upgrade computers it gives him an upperhand in the job market. Better pay and higher chance of getting almost any job he applies for. 
<BR>

Bonzi Buddy, Comet Cursor, QUAKE!!
<BR>

<BR>
you also dissed my fav company AMD you dont diss my fav unless u have an amd processor, which u probably do, and you need to get off your kids back and correct your messages... 
<BR>

<BR>
also that kid u punished for hacking... which he probably wasn't doing anything of the sort... let him get online... A couple of other things... you need to do more research on the things you say... like for instance wanting to get off of AOL, do u know why a kid would want to?? because there are soo many people on it, it slows the user down incredibly, I have internet from a remote place that rents videos and it is 2 times if not 3 times better than aol... that is why...
<BR>

<BR>
another thing, are u rich?? to be able to afford adobe photoshop that is an expensive program... but maybe I shouldn't say anything maybe u will think because your son starts playing with this program he is hacking adobe or something!!
<BR>

<BR>
Linux not lunix, it is an operating system for computers it isn't used as a hacking tool...
<BR>

<BR>
DOS can be used to open the original QUAKE game not always to be used as a hacker tool, but can be, if u see commands in there like ping and ip addresses that is just him trying to ping different servers, nothing to worry about... he is seeing how slow is slow connection is

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">T Reginald Gibbons, I feel deeply sorry for your children if you raise them in this type of environment.  As I was reading your post, I felt as if this was some massive joke, but there was no punch line.  
<BR>

<BR>
In your diatribe, you say, and I quote:
<BR>
"You could say I'm a model parent."  I seriously doubt that you are, given the contents of your post.  And if for some reason you actually ARE an ideal parent, may God see fit to save the rest of the world from ideal parents.  Addditionally, you comment, "... I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest family in the USA." I'm sorry, but this blatant show of ego doesn't wash with me.  
<BR>

<BR>
Further on, you refuse to go into where you got your research for your investigation from, yet you post a link to a so-called news site with unquestionable bias.  Do you honestly think that you can get a true idea of what being a hacker is all about from a single, biased source?  If you do, then you've just invalidated both of your previous boistrous claims and proven that you're nothing more than a sheep that follows a singular shepherd which makes for less than an ideal parent or family.
<BR>

<BR>
"Peter betrayed the principles we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities."  Perhaps he did not do anything wrong that he would have to admit to.  If you truly raised your children the way that you claim, and have the family that you claim that you do, why do you all of a sudden believe that your son is a liar?  Or does being part of an ideal family require the parents to be paranoid about the actions of their children?  This shows an extreme lack of trust in your son, and in effect shows a lack of trust in your teachings of said child.
<BR>

<BR>
"His denials continued for hours, and in the end, I was left with no choice but to ban him from using the computer until he is old enough to be responsible for his actions."  Again, you show a lack of trust in how you have taught your child by not trusting him to tell the truth.  You have punished him for faults of your own.  
<BR>

<BR>
"Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL."  Ahh yes, the land of the protected porno spammers.  You're advocating that parents use a service that allows their members to send unsolicited pornographic spam?  That doesn't sound like a good parent to me, perhaps I'm wrong in my assumption of what a good parent is.  Additionally, there was a time when a large number of the hacker majority used AOL's services simply because you could sign up and use an account by using a random credit card number, whether it was good or bad, and make use of that account for days before anyone at AOL realized that the number was invalid.  
<BR>

<BR>
"This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content."  I take it you've never heard of software such as NetNanny, etc.  Or, even better, being the good parent that you are, why do you leave it up to a filter or piece of software to regulate what your child does or does not see on the Internet?  That seems to be you blaming something that is squarely your fault on the shoulders of someone else.  Or is that yet another part of being a good parent, the ability to shrug off responsibility and pass the buck?
<BR>

<BR>
"To this end, I have decided to publish the top ten signs that your son is a hacker."  Doing two-three days of research and using a single biased source suddenly makes you an expert on the signs of someone being a hacker?  Are you for real?!?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter."  Are you on retainer with AOL, sir?  Perhaps you haven't noticed but there are better Internet services out there that cost less and provide better service.  Perhaps your son is tired of having to deal with badly written client software and a service that is overpriced?  No, that would be logical.
<BR>

<BR>
"Popular hacker software includes 'Comet Cursor', 'Bonzi Buddy' and 'Flash'."  I'm all for freedom of speech, but this borders on slander.  I wonder what the people at Macromedia that produce Flash think about this?  Or what those who design legitimate websites that utilize Flash to improve the user's experience with the site think about your heavy-handed and near mindless comment.  
<BR>

<BR>
"He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding."  So, it's the child's fault that a legitimate web designer uses Flash and the child should be punished for that?
<BR>

<BR>
"Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware."  This, sir, could not be further from the truth.  I suggest you return to your research materials, if you seek a look at the reality of this situation.  "Hackers" that I have come into contact with generally do not have the latest and greatest hardware, they use what they already have and they use it QUITE well.  
<BR>

<BR>
"You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer."  I see that you come from a relatively wealthy family.  Have you ever done enough research to see what the manufacturer prices things at and then looked at what the OEM that produces that component for the manufacturer prices things at?  Perhaps you just enjoy looking at those wonderful Compaq brown boxes with red logos when your upgrades come in.  
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well."  This has to be the biggest load of baloney that I've seen in years!  I get the feeling that AMD's lawyers are getting ready to "ream you a new one" and I'm all for it!  Do you even know where AMD is located?  What about the fact that they're traded in American stock exchanges?  Your ignorance astounds me. 
<BR>

<BR>
"4. Does your child read hacking manuals?"  I won't quote the whole thing, but it makes me wonder about this - would you remove a C programming language reference manual from your child's posession?  Or how about a copy of "Visual Basic for Dummies"?  I believe your "perfect parenting" is similar to the mind control tactics that George Orwell wrote about in 1984.  
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites."  Or maybe he's just waiting for AOL's slow service to get him a web page detailing the scores and action of last night's basketball game.  Ever think of that?  Perhaps your son is doing research for a school project as opposed to trying to hack into the NSA and do a full dump of Carnivore data onto the local machine.  You, sir, are among the most paranoid of parents that I've ever seen or heard about.
<BR>

<BR>
"Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms."  Hmm, been overdosing on the Columbine shootings, have we?  This is ludicrous.
<BR>

<BR>
"You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed."  The fact that you're of this mindset and own a firearm scares me.  
<BR>

<BR>
"You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school."  Again, we're passing the buck.  Let the school handle what you consider to be your child's problems while you do nothing about it.
<BR>

<BR>
"As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour."  If your children can be so easily persuaded that they actually do things like this, you haven't taught them a single thing about morals or their place in the world, and you sir are directly at fault.
<BR>

<BR>
"BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War."  Did you get this from your immense research, or did this just happen to show up in a lucid moment?  Additionally, I see you don't mention Unix, or even spell Linux correctly.  Would you happen to be working for The Open Group, UK, sir?  This is simply too mirthful...
<BR>

<BR>
"... even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional."  Sir, it is you and the millions like you that keep the small town computer technicians in business.  By all means, yes, when someone erases Windows the machine WILL have to be repaired by a professional.  Care for my business card?  I'll cut you a good deal... $250/hr
<BR>

<BR>
"In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface."  I'll even include a new hard drive, same size as the one you had before, for the measley sum of $1000.
<BR>

<BR>
"Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors."  Not true.  Most "hackers" I know wear three piece business suits and ties.  Your stereotype is so incorrect that it's laughable.  
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association."  Or he may be normal with the exception of being the son of an over-bearing and paranoid stricken father.
<BR>

<BR>
"For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically."  For the sake of your family's mental health, sir, you should seek counseling as soon as possible.
<BR>

<BR>
In closing, I would like to say that I seriously wonder if you're just another copy of Ned Flanders from The Simpsons.  Your ideals for perfection are extremely lacking and you seem to think that you're an expert in a field that you've only researched for a couple of days, as per your own admission.  The terms pompous and arrogant come to mind.  However, I do feel sorry for your children, sir.  Having to grow up in an environment with an overbearing, overblown and extremely paranoid father figure must be hard for them.

<BR>

<BR>
P.S. oh yeah almnost forgot thanks for dissing AMD processors, they are not made in sweatchops, and i am sure you like to pay that extra $200 to $500 for that intel ,lol, go ahead,  especially based on how much yo must make, i vote for AMD cheaper , better and gosh darn it i just like it better :), so seriousely sir you have some issues that need to be rectified, i hope you make the right decision thank you for your time.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I refuse to believe that any knowledgeable adult would write such an inaccurate piece of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt)and then post it so that all can read it.
<BR>
I mean seriously, did you do any research at all about this topic before the words came gushing out?
<BR>
To argue the points:
<BR>

<BR>
1&gt; Switch ISPs. Switch from AOL? Gasp. Shock. Horror. I do tech support. I know what kind of lousy service AOL provides to their customers. Your child probably got tired of getting kicked off the net every few minutes. And BTW, AOL ISN'T the entire internet. Not by a long shot, thank the Gods.
<BR>

<BR>
2&gt; Bonzi Buddy and Comet Cursor as hackware? Uh huh. Maybe for a hackee, not a hacker. More appropriate to call them as they are; Malware and Spyware.
<BR>

<BR>
3&gt; Wants new hardware? OMG. Computer hardware does go obsolete. Newer games do require better and faster video cards (and RAM, and hard drives...). Just be glad that's the only kind of hardware he wants. ("Daddy, can I get a Glock for my birthday? Jimmy down the street got one..." Shudder)
<BR>
And as for buying from AMD... I noticed the author thoughtfully provided a link for AMD in the article. Did you follow it? I present the following excerpt from their website:
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California:
<BR>
One AMD Place
<BR>
P.O. Box 3453
<BR>
Sunnyvale CA 94088
<BR>
800-538-8450
<BR>
(Click on the Corporate link on the main AMD page)
<BR>

<BR>
Third world company, eh? Don't tell the folks in Sunnyvale. And contrary to the author's opinion, you CAN buy AMD processors from retail outlets. That's how I got the Duron processor powering the computer I'm using right now.
<BR>

<BR>
4&gt; Reading hacking books? I'm surprised the author lets his children read anything at all by the way he carries on. Most of those books listed there are science fiction (emphasis on fiction). Except for that one by Raymond; that's about the spread of open source software. The author probably pushed to get Harry Potter out of his children's hands as well... Is it even worth asking if the author even bothered reading the said books before burning them? Didn't think so.
<BR>

<BR>
5&gt; And he may also be using it for homework too. or playing games. Or emailing Grandma. And DDoS attacks aren't executed that way, BTW.
<BR>

<BR>
6&gt; Quake. This might be the closest the author gets to getting his information correct. Except that clicking a mouse button and pulling the trigger of a gun are two VERY different things. And you don't get to respawn after geing killed,  either.
<BR>

<BR>
7&gt; It's called puberty. Get over it.
<BR>

<BR>
8&gt; Remember that research word I mentioned earlier? This would've been a good point to try some. They're distributions (or "distros") of an open source operating system. It was invented by a Finnish university student named Linus Torvolds. He started working on Linux in 1991, coming with version 1.0 in 1994. Which is considerably after the fall of the USSR. It's based on UNIX, not xenix (which from what I can tell, has very little to do with operating systems). mp3 is a file format, not a program. and the definition of telnet as taken from dictionary.com:
<BR>

<BR>
tel�net (tlnt)
<BR>
n. 
<BR>
often Telnet An Internet communications protocol that enables a computer to function as a terminal working from a remote computer. 
<BR>
A program that implements this protocol. 
<BR>

<BR>
BTW lunix is meant for machines like the Commodore 64 and such. If you do see the LILO when you turn on your computer, choose dos.
<BR>

<BR>
9&gt;Radically changed appearance? See number 7.
<BR>

<BR>
10&gt; Doing poorly in school? Let him read some books. Gaining weight? Kick him off the computer and make him go outside and play. And see number 8.
<BR>

<BR>
Having done all this, I've arrived at the following conclusions:
<BR>
1&gt; The author is an ignorant fool. (I could be polite but the subtlety would be lost.) and
<BR>
2&gt; He's managed to take spreading FUD to a whole new level.
<BR>

<BR>
There. I've put in my two cents worth.

First off, linux is a operation system developed legally.....used legitamatley and illigitamatley both, the same as windows DOS or any other system can be used. Your son is not a hacker. Your son is a poor kid with a dad who really is smothering him. Your daughter...god bless her sweet candy ass, is probably not even a virgin anymore, that is if you've let her out of your sight for more than 5 minuets since she was born.....no offence this is just a little reality check. 
<BR>
 The programs you mentioned are harmless web applications, Flash is a media content player. Comet cursor I'm not 100% sure about, but it has no basis for hacking. The books you mentioned are entertainment related books and contain no usefull information for a hacker. "xenix" is non-existant and you are full of sh*t. Microsoft didn't exist when unix and linux were first started. And neither did windows. 
<BR>
Linus Torvaldes is NOT a soviet, he's not even russian. "otaku" is a japanise cartoon
<BR>
there is NO SUCH THING as an illegal operating system, software is never illegal, untill its used for illegal purposes. a DOS/denial of services attack can be done in a milisecond or over the course of several weeks, the time spent online by your children is irrelivant. Quake is a game and nothing more, how would one get "practice" using a firearm by using a joystick or mouse?.......Monitor radiation does not effect your thinking. Your kids probably just pissed off because you wont let him piss without looking both ways first....to make sure no cars are going to drive into the bathroom and hit him.  glow stiocks and pacifiers are a part of "raving" nothing more than kids dancing to music in clubs....you know dancing don't you? or is that the devils tool also?  AMD is a legitamate company, and central processing units can't stop a person from using them in any way other than over-using them and causing them to burn out.....Lunix linux and unix are NOT dangerous in any way, and can be easily removed from your hard disk, however, I do hope you paid out the a$$ for a replacement hard drive, simply because you deserve to lose money.....Frankly im tired of typing this and disclaiming and disporving all your claims......i won't even bother with whatever it is i've missed,.....I almost think reading your article was a waste of time,......but it was so darn funny i couldn't stop.........next time you post an article do yourself a favor and site your references.....in fact, next time USE references, your fabrication of facts is damaging to your own education as well as your childrens........if i was a religious man i'd pray for your i.q. to go from 60 to at least 80.....cause honestly, retards shouldn't have children.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I am sorry in advance to all of the parents who are not up to speed with today's technology. In this letter, I will attempt to answer the comments posted above in a FACTUAL way, instead of pure ignorance.
<BR>
1. AOL (America On Line) 
<BR>
GOOD It is designed with children in mind. It does do a decent job at filtering out porn. I say that because one could still obtain porn pictures in a chat room, in E-mail, and other "not so well thought of" areas. If you want to keep your kids away from porn, talk to them about it.
<BR>
BAD: While filtering out everything that AOL feels "may" be bad to your little ones, it restricts access to a subject that might be needed. Take newsgroups for example. One cannot join in them using AOL. Also, hackers ARE on AOL, and everywhere else. See it for yourself. Go to a search engine and search for "AOL Hacks". Enough said. What about the exploits found in the AOL Instant Messenger? Wanting to change ISP's is not a bad thing. I don't have AOL anymore, and I am not a "hacker". I trust my kids. I talk to them. Do you? Or do you just like to punish them for your own lack of knowledge?
<BR>
2."Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".
<BR>
GOOD: If you want to visit and have fun at www.disney.com you have to install Flash. Flash, Comet Cursor, and Bonzi Buddy are NOT hacker programs. If you have questions, go to a search engine and enter in the above names. It just makes good sense to investigate something you don't know.
<BR>
BAD: One should check it out before posting one's opinion on a board J
<BR>
3. Asking for new hardware.
<BR>
GOOD: If one is noticing problems with ones current setup, one just might be recommending things to broaden ones learning. It is not a bad thing to learn about computers. One may want the machine to go faster. It isn't a crime. And AMD is not for sale in stores eh? Go to www.computerclubhouse.com . It's a very real building open to the public right here in Bloomington, IN. They sell AMD. They are not hackers. AMD is NOT a "knock off" chip, and it's not made in a sweatshop. It's not wrong to want to change processors. Think of it like you do a car. Is there one brand of car out there? Competition keeps prices down. One could hack just as well with an AMD, Cyrix, or an Intel processor. Oh, the only feature that I am aware of to "discourage" hacking is the chip serial number. Each processor has this little number that can be traced when activated. Remember that is true for ALL traffic. Do you like spam-mailings? Do you like the fact that people are watching you everywhere you go gathering information about the content of the sites you visit, and sharing it with others? Neither did the other 90% of society. So they disabled it. Don't take my word for it, search it out.
<BR>
BAD: Nothing bad about upgrading. I upgraded, and I am not a hacker J
<BR>
4. Hacking materials:
<BR>
GOOD: Learning about hacking by reading books can be taken good or bad. The good is that one might be studying the security of ones own system. Or trying to find one of the many holes in Microsoft's code. In this respect, it is not a bad thing. A White Hat Hacker can make a TON of money, and land a job as a systems administrator.
<BR>
BAD: Yes, this could be a cause of alarm, taken with a grain of salt. Open communication with your kids can answer the questions. However, free speech will keep the books on the shelves. One could misuse a baseball bat. Should all the stores remove them?
<BR>
5. Computer Usage.
<BR>
GOOD: Time spent on the computer should not be limited to an hour. It would take a LONG time to gain any knowledge at that speed. What if one had a really slow connection? I play Half-Life with my son. We like it. Sometimes we are on there for hours. 
<BR>
BAD: The above author has NO idea what DOSing is. DOS is a Disk Operating System. Do you have an operating system? A command prompt is not a bad thing either. I think he is referring to a Denial Of Service attack. Search the web for that. It will explain. 
<BR>
6. Quake
<BR>
GOOD: We like action games. We know not to go out and play with guns. We also are smart enough NOT to shoot people. Just because you like racing, do you speed around on highways at top speed in your car? No.
<BR>
BAD: Quake, Euchre, Solitaire, Checkers, Poker, Bridge, Bingo, Crossword Puzzles, and all games can be violent. Just go to a bingo hall and watch two elders get into it. I even saw a fist fight outside. People used to shoot each other over Poker in the old west...
<BR>
7.  Becoming argumentative and surly in his social behavior?
<BR>
GOOD: Normal Teenager Behavior. LOVE your kids. Be with them. <BR>
BAD: Here is another slight possibility. This and #4 above.
<BR>
8. LINUX.
<BR>
GOOD: Linux is a free operating system. I have the Red Hat, and Mandrake distributions. I also have FreeBSD. Linux is a clone to UNIX, which was used widely by the government, and by networking gurus all over. http://www.linux.com/learn/whatis/ is a good place to start learning about it. Linus Torvalds wrote the core, and Linus is not a soviet hacker. By the way, I am not a hacker. This is not a "hacker" operating system. It is for people that don't want to join in on the "Microsoft" monopoly bandwagon. Competition is good. Microsoft sucks anyway. I'm tired of patching and fixing it daily.
<BR>
That's why I am also running Linux. 
<BR>
BAD: Yep. A bad uninstall/install could mess a hard drive up. That's true of ANY operating system. Even Windows..
<BR>
9. Radically changed ones appearance?
<BR>
GOOD: Your teen has a heartbeat. This is a good thing. Wanting to fit in is not a bad thing. This should be encouraged, to a point.
<BR>
BAD: If you don't like one's appearance, talk it out.
<BR>
10. Struggling academically?
<BR>
GOOD: There is no good about it. Talk and find out. Is one working too much? The opposite sex is a lot more appealing than geography. 
<BR>
BAD: Slipping grades does not mean one is hacking. 
<BR>

I know how to make programs and know an extreme amount of information about computers and the internet. 1 too many fingers were pointed at various computer programs and this is needs to be corrected. Parents. Read this. "Bonzi Buddy, Flash and Comet Cursor are not "Hacker Programs". If the author would have one 1 bit of actual research into these programs, they would have realized that they are definitly not of hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
Program: Flash
<BR>
By: MarcroMedia, Inc. 
<BR>
Program Use: Designed to let Web Authors make stunning interactive webpages. 
<BR>

<BR>
Program: Comet Cursor
<BR>
By: Comet Systems
<BR>
Program Use: Allows the user to change their mouse icon, and access online shopping, web site search, Travel, Encyclopedia, and Stocks all from one program
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy: Similar to Comet Cursor but geared twards the younger age group, i believe this one is offered with the installation of Yahoo!'s Instant messaging service. 
<BR>

<BR>
DOSing other computers? if you ever took a minute to read what the general term for DOS is, its Disk Operating System. the other term for it is Denial of Service, which is a means of freezing someones computer, but still doesnt allow you access to thier computer, IF IT WASNT FOR DOS YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WEBPAGE. DOS was the beginning of the personal computer. without it, this website would have never existed. and its LINUX, not LUNIX. It is not a hacker operating system. it is an Open Source, Free of Cost, Operating System. NOTHING to do with hacking. it is highly advanced and is used by computer professionals, and is basically, a clone of a Network Operating System used by Major corportations, called "UNIX". AMD is not a 3rd world company, they make outstanding computer processors that exceede intel's chip. Many computers bought at any computer store come with AMD Processors. They are 100& legit in every way. The information you have given is 98% false. If the information you have given it true, then your convicting anyone who buys a new store boughten computer, of being a hacker, because most computers come with the helpful utilities such as Bonzi Buddy and Comet Cursor PREINSTALLED, which yours probably was too. Your making Acquisations (sorry for the spelling error) that are 100% false and i would immediatly edit your article or 100% remove it all together before you find some company that says u claim they make hacker software asking you why your doing this. A model parent? i think not. Since when was Sterotyping part of the model parent? and i WANT a response from anyone who agrees or disagrees with my statement here. JIDavis@ISD.Net is my email address. If you wish for me to write up an article that better explains the Hacker, i will, that is all i have to say. -Cypris (and no, having a screen name does not make me a hacker)

DOS = Disk Operating System
<BR>
DOS is what microsoft made before windows.
<BR>
LUNIX is nothing... i believe you mean LINUX.
<BR>
It is a far more stable OS(operating system) than windows.. and also faster. And is used by pretty much anybody running a serious server. Like the government.. its based off of UNIX not Xenix or whatever you said it was...
<BR>
AOL blows... they are slow, their service sucks.
<BR>
if your scared about "adult" content.. do your son a favor and get a different ISP and get "net nanny".
<BR>
AMD... i don't even know where to start... where do you get your fraudelant information? 
<BR>
AMD is in my opinion better and statistically faster performing than Intel chips.
<BR>

<BR>
Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".
<BR>

<BR>
How do you figure?? lmao..
<BR>
Comet Cursor = Web software to change the looks of a cursor on a web page.
<BR>
Bonzi Buddy = my mom downloaded it... haha its a purple talking monkey....not hacker software.
<BR>
Flash = software for designing web animations and menus. be careful, you may run into a website using Flash... they may be a hacker!
<BR>

<BR>
Programming with perl is a hacker manual?? learning how to make CGI scripts is hacking? CGI is used for making forms like the one i'm using write now to type this.. just not this particular one.
<BR>
45minutes a day on the computer? i'm guessing it took you longer than 45minutes to type your insanely retarded article... i spend about 5-7 hours a day on my computer... i also work 8 hours a day, i'm not a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, Quake is an online meeting place.. for people to have fun. they don't talk about hacking.. they dont PRACTICE using firearms.. they shoot eachother, and try to stay alive.. its called fun... maybe you should try having some sometime.
<BR>
oh yeah, i guess i was wrong about my previous statement "I'm not a hacker".. because truly, i am.. i hack.. i hack my own computer... hacking is not illegal. Hacking is basically doing anything on a system level. whether it be using regedit to finish a bad uninstall, or using DOS..lol
<BR>
I seriously thought this article was a joke when my friend showed it to me.. i now realize that it is not a joke, and it was just written by a severely thick-headed embarrassing dumbass father that knows shit about computers much less anything else. To this dad, i say Get A Life.. Back out of your kids lifes slightly, possibly give them a little privacy... privacy is a good thing, and when kids have none of it, they get rebellious and soon your kid will slit your throw and put your head in the microwave.
<BR>
you should remove this article before it causes your wife to divorce you and your kids to run away. because nobody wants to be married to a guy with an IQ less than his age.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First of all Sir, may I compliment you on being the biggest <b>DUMBASS</b> I've ever seen. This article is filled with nothing more than <b>LIES</b> about hacking/hackers. You obviously know nothing about computers, and had your son "Peter" tell you all these big words that you're using to look smart and confuse yourself and other parents that know nothing about computers. I'm now going to correct many of the statements that you made.<br>
-<br>
1. TelNet comes any version of Microsoft's Windows. And was developed by, none other than, <b>MICROSOFT</b>, not a hacker.<br>
2. Quake is game. Not a meeting place.
3. AOL has no such "adult content" locks that cannot be disable without the click of your mouse. The reason he/she may want a FASTER and LESS CRUMBY ISP than AOL, is because, well, AOL sucks.<br>
4. DOS is not a program used to hack into others computers. It's what makes your computer run. Without DOS, you could not install Windows.<br>
5. Flash5 is program developed by Macromedia, and many, many schools use Flash5 for teaching purposes. It's a web developing tool.<br>
6. Bonzi Buddy is just an annoying little program that, if wanted, will remember different passwords and usernames you have on websites.<br>
7. If he/she is dressing in baggy pants and bright t-shirts, wearing "binkies", and carrying Glow Sticks, he/she is whatyou would call a <b>RAVER</b>. So you may want to haul your son/daughter to the hostpital to have a drug test, instead of taking away computer priviledges.<br>
8. Linux is an OS just like Windows, only Linux is more of an industrial OS, for big businesses and on-line stores.<br>
9. The time one spends on a computer could range from 5 minutes(Long enough to check e-mail), to hours at a time(Long enough to play award-winning games such Diablo, Starcraft, etc. Long enough to work on a webpage. Long enough to chat with friends on your oh-so trusted AOL chats.).
Time really has no effect.<br>
-<br>
There are many programs you can download for free that will monitor what is being done on your computer, and those logs can only be deleted with a password.<br>
Most parents would take pride in the fact that their child has found something he/she likes to do. Just because one is on the computer, doesn't mean they are hacking.<br>
Computers are the best way to learn. You can't get your child to read a book? Plant their ass on the computer. Any Compaq, Dell, or Gateway should come with Encyclopedia programs that are very usefull for homework and school prodjects.
If not, there are many online Encyclopedias.<br><br>
Sincerly,<br>

The writer speaks of his wife Carol, his tatletale daugter Cindy and his naughty son Peter.   Hmmmm  Now where in the world have I heard those names before.  For those of you who havent already gussed yep your right its everones favorite hip seventies family the Brady's.  I think the 4000 + people who posted flames are the real funny Ignorant people. This even wound up on ZDTV. Pretty funny.  My kodos to the Author.

All that you have done is proove that we have too many itiots out there with access to public forums where they can speak their minds and do damage to the internet community. If there is any danger out there that needs to be removed its ALL of the people who think like you do. You have no real comprehension of the world that you ar scorning. You don't understand it, and you are scared of it. So, you try to unite people against it. And because there are so many idiots like you out thee you will gain some support. But you have to be a real F****** idiot to think that you would find support to shun the internet, on the internet.

If you're son is really a computer hacker, and I mean a real one, then you should be scared of him because he's much smarter than you are.

<BR>

<BR>
2.  Flash, Bonzi Buddy are hacking programs?  You ARE an idiot.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  More memory, better video card, new processor?  These are the most common upgrades!  AMD is NOT made in sweat shops, rather they are made in an ion-free environment and a multimillion dollar facility.  Underage kids are probably NOT cutting silicon chips.  Hmmmm... not sold in stores?  Have you been to a store lately? Compaq notebooks come with those processors (I just mention that since you OWN a compaq)
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Hacking manuals?  "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling and  "Hackers" by Steven Levy will not give you any practical hacking knowledge.  Try reading them first.  Great to learn about the history, but won't tell you how.  As far as the other books - nothing wrong with knowing about PERL programming and computer security.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  Nothing wrong with spending time on the computer.  Let you kid learn and spend time.  Do you want him to grow up into a complete dumbass?  He maybe the next Gates.
<BR>

<BR>
6.  Quake users are NOT hackers!  Most guys enjoy a bit of quake 3 arena frag festing.   No wonder he wants broadband access, faster video, more memory if he is a Q3 player.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?   Shit that goes with being a teenager.  Not everyone deals with adolescence the same way.
<BR>

<BR>
8.  Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?  Hmmm lots of people like Linux.  Linux is based on UNIX kernel. Hmm most of your servers on the internet run some sort of UNIX (Sun, etc.)  Nothing wrong with learning some LINUX and PERL, might help him get a job or later in life (maybe he will be a manager somewhere and knowing a bit about systems would help.)  
<BR>

<BR>
9.  Has your son radically changed his appearance?  Glow sticks, baggy pants?  Have you seen other teenagers lately? Pacifiers are associated with drug use.
<BR>

<BR>
10.  Is your son struggling academically?  Again, you have an ordinary teenageer.
<BR>

<BR>
It is obvious you have no idea what a hacker consists of.  You are not in tune with your own kid.  Not all hacking is bad either.  sometimes people refer to customizing some changes as "hacks".  You really have not learned anything.  This was the most absurb, non-thought-out, ignorant posting I have ever read!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No offense, but I'm just curious if you really know anything about computers. All the points mentioned seem to sound pretty ridiculous.
<BR>

<BR>
If having FLASH software installed in one's PC makes one a hacker, heck, then my entire campus must be full of hackers since they are actually teaching FLASH in universities. It's a programming tool, not a hacking tool.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, AMD is a reputable company with branches worldwide. I'm sure they would be pretty sad to hear of your descriptions of their business.

   global community defined by the net (see The Network and
   Internet address).  It also implies that the person
   described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic.<BR><BR>
   It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to
   describe oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves
   something of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though
   one to which new members are gladly welcome.  Thus while it is
   gratifying to be called a hacker, false claimants to the title
   are quickly labelled as "bogus" or a "wannabee".<BR><BR>

   understand proper programming techniques and principles and

For starters linux is not a hacker OS, its windows biggest competitor, and statistically more servers on the internet run linux than any other operating system. Second AMD is made in the good ole USA not some sweat shop where you jerkoff at night. You really need to get your facts straight. Some of your information is accurate, but the biggest percentage is all bullshit. Belonging to one of the largest hacker communities myself, I can tell you that if your son is a hacker, chances are he knows a hell of a lot more than you do, and you will never catch him. We all hide our tracks well. Oh and BTW there is such a thing as explorative hacking, which is what I do. I never hack to gain access to something for free or steal files. I do it for a challenge, and if I find a hole on someone's servers I report it to them so someone who wants to rip them off doesn't. Not all hacking is bad hacking, just ask kevin mitnick !!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

 First of all, if your child asks for you to switch the ISP from AOL to ANYTHING else, it is a good idea. Not because they want to "hack" it is simply because AOL is a substandard product only made popular by million dollar advertising campaigns. As far as your child being kept safe by the filtering system AOL has in place, those filters are a placebo at best. They are effective only superficially to begin with. If you think that AOL or any other internet service can keep your children out of the types of sites that you don't want them in, you are sorely mistaken. I personally recomend the AT&T Worldnet service for reliable internet access, or possibly the MSN network.
<BR>
 Second, American Micro Developements (AMD) makes a far superior product then the more popular Intel chips, as well as being a much less costly product. I sell and repair computers for a living and I will always recomend those products myself based solely on those facts. I have never heard of an AMD chip being considered a "hacker" chip, it is simply the smart buy for any computer owner.
<BR>
 Linux operating system is possibly the best thing you can allow your children to use to further their growth and understanding about computer systems. I myself use the Microsoft Windows systems simply because it is more convenient. Using Linux well, is a much more demanding job than using Windows well, forcing the user to become a more skilled computer user. I can see a very rough correlation between being a very skilled computer operator and being a hacker, after all, a hacker is by defination going to be highly skilled. SO do you want to keep your children from being a highly proficient computer user as a means to keep them from becoming a hacker? Perhapse you are going to keep them from learning how to drive, just in case they want to grow up to become a car bomber?
<BR>
 I will not even comment on how rediculous it is to clam that the three software programs specificly mentioned have anything in the slightest whatsoever to do with hacking. This man is happy that his son learned how to use Adobe, yet he thinks there is something malicious about Flash? I don't get it.
<BR>
 Quake is reported to be a meeting place for hackers to gather and learn to use firearms? News to me, I have only been playing it for about four or five years. I wish someone would have let me in on that part of the fun.
<BR>
 As far as video cards goes. I guarentee that at the time of the writing of this piece, assuming the writer is being honest and not just pulling our legs, that he really has no idea what a video card actually does. For anyone who is not familiar with the hardware, I will lay it out for you. A video card gives you better pictures. That is is, in a nut shell. A more capable video card in a machine will display more intensive graphics such as found in many computer games, more efectively. It does so by assing more RAM and usually a seperate smaller processer dedicated to the video output on the computer. You see, video graphics take up a good deal of the resources that a computer has in it's capacity to run. By taking up such a large chunk of the total resources for the graphics, the overall performance of the programs as a whole suffer. By adding a better video card, you free up the main system resources to do everything else that the computer needs to be doing, allowing the graphics card to handle that one particular job. A sound card works in the same way, for audio output and input. Audio activities usually are not as demanding as the video activities on the system as a whole, making a better video card more desireable.
<BR>
 As far as what the gentleman who wrote this article was saying, I am sure he has good intentions, assuming this wasn't a big joke. However he is so far from being right with almost everything he said, it is rediculous. The unfounded accusations made against certain companies in his posting might even be grounds for a lawsuit if they were published in the Washington Post or the Chicago Sun. They are THAT wrong and misleading. 
<BR>
 I simply want to try to prevent anyone from taking what was misleading and irresponcibly posted on this forum as being fact. It is obvious that the man who wrote this is completely in the dark about even the more basic concepts of computer technoligy. He has no basis for any of the claims that he made. Not a single sign that he listed as being proof that your child is a hacker as an ounce of merit. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Trusted or not, AOL is slow, period! If your child were a real hacker they would have their own FREE internet account that didn't require child protective gui's. 
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Hacker software?  Hmmm, let me see, the ones described:
<BR>
+ Comet Cursor
<BR>
+ Flash
<BR>
+Bonzi Buddy
<BR>
Let's take a look at this software.   
<BR>
Comet cursor www.cometcursor.com is a way to change the pointer of your mouse from a little arrow to some sort of animation (wow, kids like animation)
<BR>

<BR>
Flash, if you have been on the internet (yes even AOL counts for this one) you have experienced the magic of flash, anytime you have connected to a website that had animation, moving menus, and other "active" graphics you have seen the handy work of Flash (or one of it's friends).  So am I to understand that any child that makes their own website, and explores ways to make it (something) better is a hacker?
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy, an animated purple monkey that searches the internet (like many other common hacker things called search engines), sends email, and oh, wait, has a scheduler. http://www.bonzi.com/bonzibuddy/bonzibuddyfreehom.asp
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most people of any age are somehow limited by computer hardware. Period.  My father wants a smaller laptop so it is not so heavy to carry, my mother wants a bigger screen so that it doesn't hurt her eyes after looking at it for so long. 
<BR>
Buying parts from your computer manufacturer only ensures that you are paying too much for what you could have gotten down the street.  Manufacturers don't actually make their own parts, they OEM them from the same people that sell the parts in boxes at the computer store.
<BR>
Oh, and I can't leave this one alone, AMD makes "hacker" chips?  Wow, I need to get one of those.  The fact that AMD does not include the POSSIBILITY to turn on a serial number that is used by the manufacturer to track you, and can be used to determine which websites you visit, and what types of products you would best be suited for does not mean they make "hacker" chips, those are Doritos.  And last I checked you could buy AMD chips at any of the large hacker supply stores, CompUSA, BestBuy!  In all reality AMD processors are used in computers made by; Sony, IBM, Compaq, HP, the list goes on.  
<BR>
http://www.bestbuy.com/Detail.asp?m=488&cat=552&scat=554&e=11095392
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
OK, let's look at this one.  Hmm, this is as bad as saying to confiscate the math and history books of your child, not to mention any programming books they might learn how to program computer software with. 
<BR>

<BR>
I see books about, programming with Perl, famous crime cases where computer crimes were involved, and books about WWII and the code breakers that enabled the allies to defeat the Nazi's!
<BR>
You should be happy that your child is interested in reading, period!
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
Where do you get your information?  "DOSing" has nothing to do with the command prompt, and certainly does not take 8 hours. A simple DOS can be setup in his allotted 30 minutes quite easily if he were so inclined.  
<BR>
The fact that your child is interested in learning, anything, is good.  Maybe you should focus your energy on making sure that he is constantly learning something.  Wasting time playing games corrodes the mind and has no real positive benefits for the future.  Learning cryptography or how to program shows that your child has the ability to learn and should be encouraged.  Even if it scares you!
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is a hacker training camp, and to think I wasted all this time trying to get out to DefCON in Las Vegas.   Quake is nothing more than a game, yes that involves guns, where internet users can play against each other instead of against the computer.
<BR>
Yes, it is training him how to use weapons, like sub atomic plasma blasting head shrinking bazookas!
<BR>
Quake has nothing to do with "hacking" it is just wasting time (see mushy comments above).
<BR>
And another question, you would keep firearms in your house but not train your child about firearm safety and how to use a weapon responsibly?  Have you heard the expression, curiousity killed the cat?  Children who are told not to touch the "hidden" gun in the drawer are 10X more likely to use it for something BAD. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As your child enters the 2yr old stage they reach this "argumentative" state, hence the terrible two's.  And yes, it happens again later in life, I think it's called early teens!
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
Ignorance is BLISS!  
<BR>
Let's break these into the proper categories.  
<BR>

<BR>
BSD is Berkley UNIX, it is designed by the BSD labs and is actually quite expensive to run.
<BR>

<BR>
Debian, Mandrake, Redhat, and others are all version of Linux, an opensource operating system.  Think of it like this, the executable that starts Microsoft word is ~8MB in size, all for a simple word processor.  In Linux, because it is opensource and everybody can look at and clean up the code, the editors are more like ~1MB making it smaller faster and allowing "hackers" to communicate with each other to better something (and learn how to program in the process).
<BR>

<BR>
Linux, BSD, and many other forms of UNIX are also used by every company in the world, even the company you work for, you hacker spy!
<BR>
Yes, Linux computers are used to break into other computers, so are Microsoft ones, you better not use those either.  If a computer of any sort can break into my stereo and steal music I will buy it, and 20 others just like it.  In fact, computers cannot be used to break into your stereo, refrigerator, stove, microwave, or any other household appliance, at least that I know of.  If you are that worried about it you should have all of these items moved far away from your computer so that it is out of reach.
<BR>
Just for kicks, go to any Microsoft windows machine, go to start, run, and type telnet, wow Microsoft must be in on this "hacker" thing too!
<BR>
If your child breaks the computer by installing software it is the perfect chance for him to learn how to fix it, break it, fix it, break it, fix it.  A computer is not a magical thing, it is electricity that alternated between "on" and "off" allowing you to instruct it to do things for you.   
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
Wow, I did this with a Mohawk when I was 10, I didn't even own a computer! It is possible that your child has found any number of reasons to change their look, my guess is they are tired of getting beaten up by other children at school for wearing the nerd clothes you dress them in.
<BR>
If your child has a fascination for glow sticks it is more likely that they are doing DRUGS than "hacking" Same with pacifiers!
<BR>
I have pictures from some of the largest "hacker" conventions and I must say, I don't see a bit of color much less the "bright, day-glo colors". 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
Otaku, never heard of em.  Millions of children struggle academically, this is not because your child is a "hacker" but more likely that they have a different learning style than society tries to force down their throats!  I would suggest reading "The Way they Learn" by Cynthia Ulrich Tobias (a will known hacker supporter)
<BR>
As for the medical claims, let's see, I spend 16 hours a day in front of a computer, I am 6.1 and weigh 165lbs.  I work out 1 � hours a day and play sports on the weekends.
<BR>
I would encourage all parents to read the original post with an extremely open mind, otherwise you might as well remove your child from school (where they will certainly learn how to use a computer) and lock them in the basement, feed them only porridge and allow them only to read books that have no educational value.
<BR>

<BR>
Poor information like the orig. post is why they burned women to make prove they were witches!
<BR>

<BR>
Your friendly, problem child AKA "Hacker"!

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I decided that I would comment on your little article here. 
<BR>

<BR>
First of all I would like to ask you sir, if you have any sense what so ever?
<BR>

<BR>
The first comment that you made that I would like to look at is that about the ISP. An Internet Service Provider such as AOL, which you mentioned as being so reliable and perfect, is nothing more than a slow outdatted way for Net "newbies"(such as I do believe you are.), to get around with some sense of ease. 
<BR>

<BR>
Most more experienced Internet Trafficers will tell you that a service such as AOL is nothing more than a cheap way to be online with little freedom in what you do. 
<BR>

<BR>
The content filters as you mentioned, are not nearly as great as you think either. If any truly experienced computer user were to want to get around them, it would be no problem at all. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'd like next to point out your comment about "Popular hacker software."
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor? Comet is nothing more than a program that allows people to specify the cusors that are used on a webpage, or on their own computer. Any really experienced computer user with any hint of graphical ability knows how to make their own cusors, and will many times not even bother with such a trifle program. Then there is the fact that for Comet Cusor you many time will visit a page that will auto-install it on your system. There is nothing wrong with it. And by making it out as something it is not, you are giving it's developers a bad name.
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy. Another usually self installing engine. It's more of a bother than anything. Anyone that likes to have their computer organized in any proficent means will never bother with it. But you know what, once again it's an auto-installing program. Anotherwords, an add pops up, and the next thing you know, you have a monkey leaping across your screen. And many times it's nothing more than a pain. So most people will avoid it, and easily protect themselves from it. But once again, it is totally legit software that in no way is used primarily by "hackers."
<BR>

<BR>
Flash? Do you mean the Flash Player or Flash itself? If it's flash itself then you should be happy that your son has taken an intrest in making animations and films. Hell, web sites that are truly well designed are usually done in flash. People that play around in flash are usually people that go on to get well paying jobs at a computer industry, usually to design for graphics, or work with adjetant software.
<BR>

<BR>
You also mentioned Quake as being a sort of breeding ground for hackers. You sir are a complete idiot. Quake is nothing more than a game that people play for ENTERTAINMENT. It is used yes mainly by teenagers, but it is a great interactive way to have fun. Not some breeding ground of weaponry and hackerdom.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh ya, did you know that most of the people that run your damn networks are probably hackers? Ya, they are true hackers. They put together programs and code sets that help them to control your computer network, so that you can run your computer online. 
<BR>

<BR>
Also, learn about social classes. someone that dresses as you say does not mean they are a computer hacker. It may mean they want to be an individual, or that they hang with a group of Ravers. Or they could just think it's cool. What you want is a damned communistic view on computer usage. You're like one of those people that refuse to use a calculator because it's a machine.
<BR>

<BR>
People like you make me sick. Case in point, you have no idea what you are talking about, and you probably never will. You're eyes are so closed that you shall never see anything clearly or with an open mind, instead you shall try to keep within a small shell of life, sheltering yourself and your children. I really feel sorry for your son because you are in no way a good parent. Instead you set boundries for him to act with no freedom or expression. I pity him, and I pity you for your idiocy. Good day.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
reasons why this is total rubbish.
<BR>

<BR>
90% of people i know that go on the internet, spend more than 30 minutes on it.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is a fun online, first person shooter game, that has an online and offline option.
<BR>

<BR>
a change of clothes would more likley be that more people these days are getting into grunger music and skateborder, which explains it all.
<BR>

<BR>
Asking for more hardware is normal. I am always asking for more memory, better video cards ect. It is good to have an up to date computer. They will probably want it to play games and have FUN
<BR>

<BR>
About the changing ISP thing. A good reason to change from AOL would be becouse unless your about 50 it is a bad ISP. It is too limited for anyone, not just hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
If you would like to meet the funniest hackers who like to think they are cool go to www.graal2001.com and play the game and ask if any hackers are on. If your son is hacking it is most likley what these guys are doing. It is just editing a game and most likley harmless.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

How the hell do you get to a DOS prompt on a remote machine??? New trick I want to know ?!?! Comet, Bonzi Buddy, FLASH ?!!!! Hacker programs. How about l0pht software @stake software, port scanners, brute force attackers etc etc etc.  OMG I hope that this was a joke article.

The kids even worse, poor kids, i wish to everything they grow up ok.  But also here is PROOF.  Well i think.  After about 2000 posts he repleid once again on the message boards stating his son is listening to "electronic guatiars" and its related to hacking.  No one is that narrow minded and sheltered to have not grown up with that stuff since the 70's.  That was said to get more feedback and comments.  Which it worked.  He also replied later with the subject of "Ceo Meoa" or something i dont care enough to remember, saying something else ridiculously stupid, just for feedback, that no real human being in their right mind would ever say.  Thus, in my opinion, and i'm sure if you think about it, it's a stunt, joke, publicity article, and it sure as hell worked to get on TechTV.  Later all,

<BR>
1. Do you often find yourself burning so-called 'Hacking manuals"?
<BR>
2. Do any of your clothes contain swastikas?
<BR>
3. Do you vote for the National Socialist party in presidential elections?
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------
<BR>
4. Do your children love you? I think not.
<BR>
5. Are you a control freak? yes.
<BR>

<BR>
Afterword:
<BR>
You are by far the most arrogant person I have ever come in contact with! Perfect family? Model parent? Man, see a doctor. What was that crap about hacker software? Flash? Comet Cursor? Those are legitimate products that are used on many appropriate websites. Whats wrong with Linux?( And it is linux, you incompetant) Its Linus Torvalds, it was made in the early 90s, it's not illegal, it can be easily removed,and if you need a professional to reinstall windows, you must be a single-cell lifeform. You have problems....<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Just like to tell who ever made this lame "story" up that they really must have a hard time understanding pretty much anything. These kids that are doing this designing and working with computers at age 13 are what are going to keep this world running. And for this dude that says he's a model parent and stalks his kids, I can almost gurrentuee that they will grow up to be drug adicts and low lifes. Hahaha.. You make me laugh. This guy is pethetic... Thanks for the laugh and i'm sure the other thousands have enjoyed their laugh to.

This is not serious. its simply a story to catch all you simple minded fools that are too stupid to know what the author is really saying.
<BR>

<BR>
We all know that to be a hacker all you need is a modem. havent you see the movies.
<BR>

<BR>
I suggest most of you read this story again.
<BR>
Print it out. If you have a printer, which of course could be used for hacking by any teenager, so be careful. Printers are evil.
<BR>
Especially Epson. which arent really printers at all. but a sophisticated hacking device.
<BR>

<BR>
Then after you all read it a dozen times. do some research on all these hacking programs, you will then see why its a joke. Also this may then help you to see the complexity of the humour in the other 9 items.

Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers

YOU FAG! tis one of the most played games on earth!

BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system.

HACKER OS? ARE YOU STUPID?! LARGE COROPRATIONS USE IT including your trust wroth AOL/MS are they hackers

responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet"

TELNET JUST MAKES RAW CONNECTIons to a port

If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive.

YOU FAg! ITS CALLED UN-INSTALLING IT!!! YOU KNOW ALOT ABOUT "ADD/REMOVE PROGS"

To everyone who has posted negative and refuting coments to this article, thank you. Thank you for giving me such a laugh, for showing me just how many fuckwits there are in this world. You have, one and all, shown just how low an IQ can drop and yet still allow the body to function. You should all check in to your local clinics, cos I'm sure the medical world would be able to use you. Clinically brain dead, yet still functioning.

My husband is a respectable employee at a local ISP and uses Linux, DOS and plays Quake with his friends...he is BY NO MEANS a computer hacker!  Just because people like to explore different operating systems other than Windows does not make them a computer hacker. You are basically telling parents to moniter their child's every move, that is not teaching them to grow up and be responsible.  It's only teaching them to be paranoid of everything and everyone.  There is a certain point where concern turns into obsession and I feel you have gone WAY over that point.  This is her husband now, I just have a few things to say, you are an idiot, I'm not saying that to be mean or disrespectful, but if you are going to post "information" that you've researched, you may want to do a little research before you do that.  "Comet Cursor" "Bonzi Buddy" these are perfectly harmless programs that you probably accidently installed.  "Lunix"...for God's sake man it's "Linux".  Those so called third world company processors that aren't sold in stores, those "AMD" chipsets, AMD happens to make some of the best and most affordable processors on the market today.  They have been around for more than 30 years, and their world headquarters in in California.  Oh yea, go to any Best Buy and check out how many computers you find with an AMD processor, many name brands such as Compaq and Micron use AMD processors.  As far as your whole "Hacker" notion, the Jargon File (www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/)defines a hacker as the following:
<BR>

<BR>
Hacker, n.
<BR>

<BR>
[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe]
<BR>

<BR>
1.  A person who enjoys the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the miimum necessary.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  A person capable of appreciating hack value.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  A person who is good at programming quickly.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in a &lt;i&gt;Unix hacker&lt;/i&gt;.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)
<BR>

<BR>
6.  An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One may be an astronomy hacker, for example.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.
<BR>

<BR>
8. [depreciated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence &lt;i&gt;password hacker, network hacker.&lt;/i&gt;  The correct term for this sense is cracker.
<BR>

<BR>
With that being said I believe what your meant in your article is that your son is a cracker.  Even that I would highly doubt.  Just because he may have downloaded a few programs that you had no clue about (which is apparently nearly everything remotely related to a computer and it's use) doesn't make your son a cracker.  I personally feel bad for your kid for having such an ignorant man for a father.  Personally if you were my father I would run away, because I couldn't put up with such ignorance.  On that note I will stop my rambling.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm possibly the world's most cynical person, but I still refuse to believe that anyone is so clueless as to actually, earnestly believe just about anything in this story.  Therefore, I have to assume that it's just a troll having fun.<BR><BR>
However, it <b>is</b> possible, however remotely, that this guy is serious.  Therefore, I'll go over the most glaring errors, half-truths, and outright lies in this story, presenting the facts.<BR><BR><li>
<i>Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL.</i><BR><BR>I respectfully submit that, according to the Attorneys General of at least seven states, AOL is <b>not</b> a responsible ISP.  They have been the subject of enough legal action to make John Gotti thankful for his relatively low level of legal entanglements.<BR><BR><li><i>If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider.<BR><BR>One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content.</i><BR><BR>Or he might just want a <b>real</b> ISP, whose connections adhere to the standards published by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">WWW Consortium</a> (the people who define what the web is and how it works), the Internet Protocol (developed by the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>, or DARPA - part of the US Department of Defense, and used to create ARPAnet, the predecessor of the Internet), and which doesn't require buggy client software with the virus-like behavior of corrupting Windows' networking code - which resulted in a $8 billion <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/02/02/aol.lawsuit.02/">class-action lawsuit</a> filed in February 2000.<BR><BR><li><i>It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites.</i><BR><BR>And just how does one get to a hacker site, if your NetNanny/CyberSitter/other filtering software is properly configured?<BR><BR><li><i>Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".</i><BR><BR>Comet Cursor is a desktop customization application, whose sole function is to provide cute, fuzzy mouse pointer graphics and fancy icons.  And the purple Bonzi Buddy ape, while annoying, is nothing more than a dumbed-down system resource hog that combines a poor implementation of several common functions - email, chat, web searching, etc.  If you don't have Flash installed, I pity you every time you surf the web - it's used to display the fancy moving graphics of a <b>lot</b> of web sites.<BR><BR><li><i>He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding.</i><BR><BR>Free clue here:  Internet Explorer, if it detects web content that requires a plugin you don't have, will ask this question.  Grounding your son because Microsoft decided to make browser plugin so easy that even my 68-year-old stepfather can do it is simply insane.<BR><BR><li><i>Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware.</i><BR><BR>This couldn't be further from the truth.  Most hackers, at least the ones I know, use trailing-edge technology - due to lack of funds, an affinity for the "good old days" of computing, and a level of expertise that allows them to make full use of such hardware so they don't <b>need</b> to blow money on the new stuff.<BR><BR><li><i> You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer.</i><BR><BR>You must like paying $500 for a $75 part in a box that says "Compaq".  And what's this about "legal" hardware?  There is almost no computer hardware that's illegal to buy, own, use, possess, or sell in the United States - other nations on the other hand, such as Pakistan and China, heavily regulate what the public is allowed to own.  But since you posted this story on the Internet, I have to assume you're not there - Internet access is illegal for the most part in those countries.<BR><BR><li><i>If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm.</i><BR><BR>Since when is wanting a faster processor for less money a capital offense?<BR><BR><li><i>AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking.</i><BR><BR>AMD (Advanced Micro Devices - NYSE symbol AMD) has been a manufacturer of microprocessors since 1969 - before there were hackers.  Based in Sunnyvale CA, they were at one point a licensed OEM manufacturer for Intel, when Intel couldn't make enough 8088 processors for IBM's then-new product, the IBM PC (AMD and Intel later cancelled their arrangement after some patent and license disagreements). And I sincerely hope their attorneys see your slanderous remark.<BR><BR><li><i>AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites.</i><BR><BR>Walk into your local MicroCenter store - you'll find them on the shelf.<BR><BR><li><i>There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond.</i><BR><BR>4 novels, 1 software development manual, 1 sort-of-history book, a documentary about sold-out programmers with no souls, and an editorial piece about why Microsoft products are the ones worth nothing while Open Source products are the ones that are free.  Yup, can't have the kiddies reading any of that.  Better to have them reading books whose protagonists wander the desert for 40 years and declare a death penalty for using our reproductive organs, with a climactic scene where a guy is nailed to a cross for telling people to be good to one another.  Much more light-hearted stuff, there.<BR><BR><li><i>If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites.</i><BR><BR>Or he might be waiting on AOL's slow-assed servers to bring up tomorrow's weather forecast, so he can plan what he'll wear to school tomorrow.  Maybe he's even looking at his school's website, hoping school will start early or end late tomorrow, so he can have that much more time away from you.<BR><BR><li><i>DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours.</i><BR><BR>Any wannabe-hacker script-kiddie worth his salt can DOS any vulnerable site in 15 minutes or less.  If he can't, he's either not hacker material or the site is running an OS that's not vulnerable to the most common attacks (Hint:  If it's not vulnerable, there's about an 85% chance it's running a non-MS operating system - such as FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, Solaris, etc.)<BR><BR><li><i>Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. </i><BR><BR>What rock did you just crawl out from under?  Quake is a <b><strong><i>GAME</i></strong></b>. A quite violent game, but a game nonetheless.  How long have you had a computer?  A week?!<BR><BR><li><i>You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed.</i><BR><BR>Both of these are standard precautions for any responsible firearm owner. And the fact that someone as clueless as you appear to be owns firearms is perhaps the only rational argument I've ever seen for more gun control laws.<BR><BR><li><i>Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in.</i><BR><BR>Any child with you for a parent would have to be mentally unbalanced to not feel smothered, if you follow your own advice.<BR><BR><li><i>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War.</i><BR><BR>There is not a word of accuracy in that sentence.  BSD is Berkeley Software Distribution, based on UNIX, which in turn was written by <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/">Bell Laboratories</a> (at the time a subsidiary of American Telephone & Telegraph, or AT&T) to run on the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-7 minicomputer for the purpose of telephone system automation.  BSD was developed by students at the University of California, Berkeley as a set of enhancements to UNIX, which included a revolutionary networking protocol suite, TCP/IP.  This protocol is what made ARPAnet (which evolved into the Internet you now so cluelessly use) possible.  If you like the Internet, then send your thanks to the people at Berkeley who wrote BSD, because without them you'd still be trying to figure out "I Love Lucy" plotlines.  The work done at Berkeley was approved by <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/history/unix/">Bell Labs</a>.  Linux is a free operating system kernel, written with the goal of working and acting just like UNIX.  It was written by <a href="http://www.cs.Helsinki.FI/~torvalds/"">Linus Torvalds</a>, who was a college student in Finland.  Mr. Torvalds now works for <a href="http://transmeta.com/">Transmeta Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: TMTA), a Santa Clara, CA-based maker of low-power-usage processors and a supplier of processors for NEC, Fujitsu, Casio, Hitachi, Sony, Gateway, Toshiba, and Microsoft. He wrote the first version of Linux on a PC running <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/minix.html">Minix</a>, a free Unix clone written by Andrew Tanenbaum, Professor of Computer Science at <a href="ahttp://www.vu.nl/english/index.html">Vrije Universiteit</a> in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  He wrote the first version of this kernel from scratch.  It is commonly bundled with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> software, which is required for the kernel to do anything useful.  GNU software is published by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, and is licensed in a manner that allows it to be copied legally.  <a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/">Mandrake</a> is a company that pre-packages the Linux kernel and GNU software (collectively referred to as GNU/Linux) as a single distribution, and whose revenue comes from selling support for the software as packaged by them.  <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to provide a pre-packaged GNU/Linux distribution, similar to Mandrake, but developed primarily as a public service, hobby, academic pursuit, etc. (different people have different reasons for contributing code).  Various versions of GNU/Linux and BSD are currently used by most major universities in the US, as well as the United States Department of Defense, IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, various state and local governments, and hundreds of others - to call it illegal puts your total lack of anything resembling a clue in the spotlight.<BR><BR><li><i>It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government.</i><BR><BR>Wow, a crumb of truth!  Xenix was indeed written by Microsoft - but not specifically for the US government.  Xenix is now a trademark of SCO, which also owns the rights to UnixWare, a former Novell product.  And, as I have already pointd out, neither are the basis for BSD or Linux.<BR><BR><li><i>These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program.</i><BR><BR>They're also used to run about 60% of all web servers on the Internet.  And they're used to run the air traffic control systems of major airports.  And they're used to tally up the numbers generated by the US Census Bureau.  And they're used to run the telephone system.  And they're used to operate file servers at large corporations.  they're used to run payroll for about 18% of all companies with greater than 100 employees. And they're used to automate manufacturing operations at Daimler-Chrysler.  And they're used to run scientific experiments using computers on the Space Shuttle.  And they're used by Lockheed-Martin to design the new Advanced Tactical Fighter, the YF-22.  And they're used by web sites to keep your credit card number safe when you buy a book on amazon.com.  And they're used to run the computers at the National Security Agency, the US Department of Defense, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States House of Representatives, and the National Aeronautical and Space Administration.  Oh, and if you're worried that somebody may be stealing your music, then just don't rip your Barry Manilow CD's to mp3's.  By the way, over 20% of all people who illegally copy music using the mp3 sound format, are doing so on computers running Microsoft Windows <b>and</b> connecting to the Internet via AOL.  Almost all of the rest are still using Windows, just on another ISP - and those numbers just happen to closely parallel market share numbers.<BR><BR><li><i>Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone.</i>Linus Torvalds is a famous software developer.  He is currently not facing any criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Bureau of Investigation, or the Santa Clara Police Department according to representatives of those organizations.  The most serious legal entanglement he has faced since coming to the United States is a parking ticket - and he has no criminal record in Finland either, according to Interpol.  If only Bill Gates were such a shining example of a law-abiding pillar of the community.  Telnet is a networking service, whose standard was written by Jon Postel at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1972 revised in 1973 and several more times since) while Linus Torvalds was still being bottle-fed.  It provides a protocol for remotely logging in to a UNIX computer, in order to run an interactive terminal without physically walking across the building (or across the state) to physically be at one of the large mainframe computers of the time.  The telnet client program emulates a DEC VT 100 terminal (at the least - most versions also support VT-220 emulation and several other emulations).  The most popular telnet client is NCSA Telnet, by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.  It originally used a cable connected directly from client to server, although it can now be used to access any computer that is connected to the same network as the client (or if both are internet-connected), as long as the computer being accessed is running a program that listens for Telnet connections and as long as the TCP port used for telnet is not being blocked by a firewall between them.  Some kind of connection is still required, be it via dialup modem, direct cable connection between the computers, ethernet, token ring, cellular modem, frame relay network, etc.  If you're not connected to the Internet, there is no way for anyone to hack into your computer without entering the room it's in.  If your article isn't written as a joke, then I suggest you go to a doctor immediately and request that he give you a brain implant.  Follow this with about 12-24 months of intense study in the field of computer technology.  The first course I would suggest is a thorough reading of several books:  PC's For Dummies, UNIX For Dummies, and TCP/IP For Dummies.  This should be considered a first step towards attainment of a clue.<BR><BR><li><i>Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.</i><BR><BR>If you need a professional to uninstall Linux and install Windows, then you have no business being anywhere near a computer.<BR><BR><li><i>If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix.</i><BR><BR>No, this means someone has installed LILO (LInux LOader - a boot loader written to allow you to run Linux on the same computer as other operating systems, such as Windows - but capable of being used to load any operating system you wish, with or without Linux).<BR><BR><li><i>In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive.</i><BR><BR>Hawhawhawhawhaw!!!!!  I'll bet you have to send your computer to a professional to turn the damn thing on for you!  Insert Windows 98/2000/ME CD, turn on computer, choose "Boot From CD", type "fdisk" and you're well on your way to removing Linux and installing Windows.  Of course, that's analogous to trading in a 1963 Mercedes-Benz gullwing coupe for a 1993 Hyundai Excel with a flat tire...<BR><BR><li><i>Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.</i><BR><BR>This is a flat-out lie.  Plain and simple.  Not just a half-truth.  Not just a misperception.  This is so patently untrue that it is inconceivable that you actually read anything about this and don't know it to be untrue.<BR><BR><li><i>If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks.</i><BR><BR>Get your fashion statements straight.  You're describing ravers - most of whom haven't the first clue about hacking, and don't want one.<BR><BR><li><i>(I have no idea why they do this)</i><BR><BR>With your apparent lack of knowledge regarding anything else, why state the obvious by saying that you "have no idea..."?  Of course you have no idea; you're an idiot!<BR><BR><li><i>If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association.</i><BR><BR>So now Japanese cartoons are the reason your kid isn't the valedictorian and the captain of the football team?!?!  Animated shows are to blame for your child's failure to live up to your excessive demands?!?!  Hey!  You!  Out of the gene pool!  Now!!!<BR><BR><li><i>Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation.</i><BR><BR>Exposure to modern low-radiation cathode ray tubes found in computer monitors built since about 1993, at a level of about 2 hours per day, is roughly equal to that you'll get from watching PAX tv for 1 hour 30 minutes per day.  Add in an occasional trip to the microwave oven, and you're better off with the computer than with the TV.<BR><BR><li><i>In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases.</i><BR><BR>Meningitis?!?!  Caused by computer radiation?!?!  I take it you don't believe the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, or the Meningitis Foundation of America when they all say that meningitis is caused by bacteria?  You're more likely to get meningitis at a soccer game than in front of your computer.  You could put your head through the screen on your monitor and leave it there for years, and I guarantee you that it wouldn't cause meningitis.  I suggest that you, sir, are the one suffering from a variety of psychological diseases - probably paranoid delusions, low intelligence, and/or sociopathic personality disorder (whose symptoms include pathological, compulsive lying).<BR><BR>Seriously, this article was probably the funniest thing I've ever seen on the web...I'll even bet there is somebody, somewhere, who's gullible enough to believe every word of it :-)<BR><BR>And if you posted this article in earnest, I'd like to know so I can call CNN.  I bet they'd go apeshit over finding the world's stupidest person.  Hahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You can see his warped definition of a hacker, or read all his mobo jumbo. First of all it isn't Lunix, its Linux. The person that Created this OS is Linus Torvalds, not the other way around. He is from Norway not Russia or China. Norway is not Communist. The OS is based on minix not xenix. Hackers hack code for common good use for all. Crackers and script kiddies break into computers and cause damage. Linus did not create telnet. Telnet is not for hackers ("crackers"), it is for businesses to connect to a companies intranet. Back then if you used telnet you needed a telephone connection still. What the HELL does this idiot think you are going to connect with, "hacker lunix string". Linux is not illeagal it is distributed under a lawful license made in the US that is accepted in the US. And lastly Linux can be removed, and by yourself. All you do is for Windows users is pop in the Windows repair disk and type in fdisk, then you find the partition that has Linux on it and remove it. Next you select the free disk space that was a Linux partition and make it a windows partition. And then format it. If you think you can not take Linux off (which is completely wrong) try taking off Win CE version 3.0. They removed all the system calls so you can't put another OS on it. It's my device not Microsofts.

This guy is really screwed up. I would guess he is a Confederate, Nazi, Salem Witch Hunter, Hick that fears what he doesn't understand. Linux and Open Source is more American then Microsoft. Oh yes, Glow sticks aren't for hackers (crackers) there for CLUBING...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I am a 15 year old who enjoys computer games.  I spend more then your 45 minute time limit, anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half.  I play Team Fortress Classic, which is a team based multiplayer modification for the Action/Adventure Game Half-Life.  I also used to play Quake, before Half-Life came out and upped the standards for games.  In the rest of my life, I'm a Life Scout, soon to be Eagle, and I play Tennis.  About Quake being a "place for hackers to meet and to do weapon training".  That is completely impossible.  Yes, there are some hackers who play Quake, but that is the rare case, not the standard.  Most people who play any of that type of game play because of the challenge.  It is more fun because you are pitted against others, who are smarter then computers, and its virtual, so no one gets hurt.  Also, if they were really doing "Weapon Training", why in the world would we do it with Quake?  Quake is one of the most unrealistic games out there, with weapons you couldn't imagine, and how is using a mouse going to improve out marksmanship?

<BR>
1. I have read Snow Crash and realy is not a manual, it's a peice of sci-fi by a great auther, Banning it would make you no better then the people in the book Ferinheit 451
<BR>

<BR>
2. Quake is not virtual reality world. Quake was actually the first 3D. Shooter game and no it does not warp people's minds.
<BR>

<BR>
3.About the clothing...when was the last time you took a look at current fashion? 1957?
<BR>

<BR>
4. Flash and Comet Curser are programs used for net surfing. Net Suring=Not hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Actually if you use A.O.L. and your kids are asking to change browser it may be because...AOL is HORRIBLE! You don't need the damn filter! It is impossible to stumble on pornography on the net without active helo from the user!
<BR>

<BR>
6. I spend alot of time near my PC nad I'm Ok, I dont exactly have the body of a baywatch castmember but I'm not an overwait Otaku with MPD. All things emit radiation, Ionized Radiration is the kind that is bad and if PC's did emit that stuff I'd be takin' a dirtnap.
<BR>

<BR>
7. An Otaku is actually a name for a fan of Japanese Anime.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Your are confusing Linux with the Internet. Infact Linux was invented by an American named Linus I can't remember his last name. Infact the Internet was origionaly supposed to be a military network but like most gpv't projects it was shelved and then later coverted for civiliian use.
<BR>

<BR>
9. If your son asks for a new hard drive it means your running out of memory.
<BR>

<BR>
10. Failing in school can be caused by a number of things. Does he have A.D.D.?
<BR>

<BR>
11. Stop being so protective. Infact you've become so protective it is YOUR mind that has been twisted and mishapen. You treat your children like robots who belive anything they see. Get it through your skull that your children are capable of sentiant thought and don't need your holding them by the hand.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I would suggest you just leave your son alone at the computer, as obviously you have NO idea what he is in fact doing.
<BR>

<BR>
As for some of your points.
<BR>

<BR>
1. AOL as an ISP, ever tried playing a game on an AOL connection (it's terrible)
<BR>

<BR>
2. faster video card, ever try playing any game your son wants to play with the current card?? i would guess not.
<BR>

<BR>
3. hacker books... I have 3 bookcases of what you would call 'hacker books'. None of those books you've mentioned are anywhere NEAR hacking material. Mostly they are social commentry or science fiction with a programming language thrown in there.
<BR>

<BR>
I suppose you'd rather your son be bus driver or labourer than technologically literate and capable. 
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you should talk to your son, and discuss (not accuse) what you think is happening. 
<BR>

<BR>
Then again, i can't believe i've just wasted a couple of minutes of my time on something this pathetic.

I know he may have done the ten things that you listed but unfortunately those ten things are honestly no cause for alarm. Im 17, a female and I come from a well structured family. I spend honestly 3 or more hours a day on the computer. I do homework, and research. I play games and communicate with other persons accross the world. I am not a hacker, and I do not ever plan to be. I have a wide knowledge of computers because they interest me, not because I want to harm others. My grades are not suffering and neither is my sleep habits. I maintain a 3.875 GPA and have plans to attend Johnson and Wales University in Miami and major in Culinary arts this coming September. I have saved my parents several hundred dollars because I was able to install software and hardware upgrades myself. They did not have to pay a service techinican fifty dollars an hour or more to install the equipment. Also, I would imagine that your children have homework research assignments that rewuire searching online, now I am in college classes, and I have spent 5 or 6 hours a day researching information on my Psychology thesis. I was even taking my time and the report took me the full length of time we were given.
<BR>

<BR>
Also to be that involved in your childs life is unhealthy. I drive on my own, I go out on my own and I date. I know my limits, and understand my responsibilities. I help to take care of my Grandmother at home, I make dinner nightly, and I take care of my younger brother if he needs a ride somewhere. The computer does not interfere with my activites as a normal teen. I am an all state band student, and I can play several instrumets. I am part of my church choir and orchestra, I also participare on the school and local YMCA swim team and I play softball for my high school. I also work part time at a doctors office after school for a few hours so I can have money of my own, put gas in my car and pay for insureance. I enjoy this and I have learned a lot. I also intern Friday, Saturday and Sunday at a few restaurants in town. This has given me more experience in a career field I have always dreamed of. I am extremely grateful for what I have and I know that I must keep working hard to achieve my goals. I understand that you have concerns but I feel you need to let up and relax, you may end up making your children so dependant upon you they may never let go. I have been raised to know right from wrong and my biggest fear in life is not only letting myself down but my parents down if I were to chose wrongly.
<BR>

<BR>
I do not see what is wrong with brightly colored clothing and spiky hair. I dress like that. It is comfortable and it is what I like. I do not always dress in baggy, brightly colored garments because there is a time and a place for everything, but going to school like that does not appear to be a problem. If your son is carrying pascifiers and glow sticks, you should check into what kind of music he is listening to, and give him a drug test. Glow sticks and pascifiers are carried by ravers, and they listen to techno music and do ecstasy. Ecstasy depletes the seratonin in your brain and causes depression, and possibly suicide. Ecstasy can eat holes in the brain and cause memory loss. If you have seen your child or any of their friends with ANYTHING like that I would take IMMIDEATE action and consult their parents.<BR>

"Hackers" as you portray them differ like any other group of people. You are a facist idiot, i would suggest you should do a little more of your so called "research" before you post moronic and ignorant comments. Watching hackers the movie does not count as research, nor does saying that everyone who uses LINUX is a hacker, linux can provide many very useful network tools/services, real hackers are not people who break into sites looking for credit cards, they are people with a un-quencheable thirst for knowledge, and knowledge is what you lack.

It is stable unlike windows and is used by much of the scientific community. Second AMD is simply another processor alternative there are no hacking safeguards in intels chips command sets this would be impossible with the current technology if intel is claiming that they have such a thing I have never seen this in any testing that I have done. AMD is simply a better chip. and lastly I would like to comment on the clothes and attitude of the Teenagers involved, that is a phenomenom that is occuring like spikes and leather jackets of the eighties. The attitude change is part of discovering your identity. A Teen will try something and ask themselves if this is who they are, it is called a transition phase for a reason. I am a 30 year old father of two and worry about my children but this entire article is completely off base. I am not a hacker nor a teen but I spend many hours on my computers researching and yes sometimes playing games. A few days research will not tell you if someone is a hacker. You can know how to do anything but it is not until you use it that it will become realized. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

It takes code with associates with math inorder to hack into something. Many people like Linux not just hackers, it actually is a very good OS, now say OOOOOHH AHHHH.

<BR>
Some of the things you named are things many teens partake in and are still drugfree and safe. Infact, most of the things you mentioned are not even close to the characteristics of a hacker. Most hackers do not maliciously destroy systems, but rather find holes in code security, and inform the person or fix it themselves. People who destroy and ravage sites for the popularity are nothing but fools with nothing better to do. 
<BR>

<BR>
Hackers, believe it or not, could get a job making alot more money than you can dream of. If I were you, I would encourage my sons hacking, as long as he was not breaching systems to destroy them, and knew what he was doing. Most hackers have a better idea of networking than others, and thats why they can find holes in such things. Such hackers could get a nice job as a network tech paying some good cash. 
<BR>

<BR>
This is coming from a sixteen year old who has the skills to takedown your website, but not the intent. I currently have a job managing a 60 computer network making $15 an hour. Not bad eh? And guess how I learned? Reading networking security/hacking manuals to learn the depths of all the code and hardware.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
                   3 is one of three coding schemes (layer 1, layer 2 and
<BR>
                   layer 3) for the compression of audio signals. Layer 3
<BR>
                   uses perceptual audio coding and psychoacoustic
<BR>
                   compression to remove all superfluous information
<BR>
                   (more specifically, the redundant and irrelevant parts
<BR>
                   of a sound signal. The stuff the human ear doesn't
<BR>
                   hear anyway). It also adds a MDCT (Modified
<BR>
                   Discrete Cosine Transform) that implements a filter
<BR>
                   bank, increasing the frequency resolution 18 times
<BR>
                   higher than that of layer 2. 
<BR>

<BR>
                   The result in real terms is layer 3 shrinks the original
<BR>
                   sound data from a CD (with a *bitrate of 1411.2
<BR>
                   kilobits per one second of stereo music) by a factor
<BR>
                   of 12 (down to 112-128kbps) without sacrificing
<BR>
                   sound quality. 
<BR>

<BR>
                   *Bitrate denotes the average number of bits that one second of audio data will
<BR>
                   consume. 
<BR>

<BR>
                   Because MP3 files are small, they can easily be transferred across the Internet.
<BR>
                   Controversy arises when copyrighted songs are sold and distributed illegally off
<BR>
                   of Web sites. On the other hand, musicians may be able to use this technology
<BR>
                   to distribute their own songs from their own Web sites to their listeners, thus
<BR>
                   eliminating the need for record companies. Costs to the consumer would

                   decrease, and profits for the musicians would increase. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
As far as your son wanting computer hardware upgrades: larger monitor, memory, video card, etc. He was probably just wanting to upgrade from Quake to Quake Arena and needed a little hardware boost.
<BR>

<BR>
Just because he likes the computer doesn't make him a hacker. Maybe you should spend a little more time with him and he wouldn't be on the computer so much.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Right now I have in front of me (and behind me) 4 monitors and 3 CPUs... 1 CPU, 1 monitor(AlienWare, now.. if you knew what that FVCKING WAS...you'll probably say it's a hacker's computer, won't you) that has EVERYTHING a GAMER could need. Next, I have the CPU that I'm on which has 2 monitors connected. Why? I'm a web designer. I MAKE WEBPAGES! My other CPU is just a piece of $hit. It handles my graphics programs.
<BR>

<BR>
I want to dye my hair red. I like to wear red shirts, infact I'm wearing a red one right now.
<BR>

<BR>
Just to point out, I know : PHP, Perl/CGI, HTML, JS, Java, DHTML, VML, FLASH, VB, C/++. So I'm a hacker? Good times.
<BR>

<BR>
""There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond."" NONE of these neccessarily promote hacking in any way (that I know of)... Prog. with Perl teachs people to create sites with an INTERNET PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE YOU FVCKING HOMO!
<BR>

<BR>
In conclusion, I'd just like to say that when you said that he "...may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association...". Just want to point out that groups like that are EXTREMLY difficult to get into, and IF your son is even given a second look by the 1337 groups, I think there would be more signs of a hacker than the BS you've slapped up here.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hello Mr Gibbons,
<BR>

<BR>
I understand completely how you feel.  I, myself, also make sure I attend the parties my two teenage children attend, to make sure there are no drugs or people of questionable morals attending.  I also keep a very close eye on some of the other teenage girls in attendance to ensure they are treated right.
<BR>

<BR>
You are also correct in the determination that a child's education is incomplete without an understanding of modern technology such as video cassette recorders and computers.  I recently bought a Hewlett-Packard Pentium-3 system for my children and myself to become familiar with.  I made sure I purchased a Pentium-3 processor as I understand this processor has a serial number that is recorded every time an Internet site is visited.  I think this is a wonderful idea.  (I also do not trust those AMD processors - who knows what those foreigners put in their processors.)
<BR>

<BR>
My children have not asked me to change ISP - I am happy with AOL, and glad that a lot of the Internet is inaccessible to us.  The Internet is full of dangerous things like bomb recipies, drug growing information, pornography and information on heathen religions like Rastafarians, Witchcraft and Buddhists.  My children need as much exposure to these tools of Satan as they need a good Christian parent who cannot dish out a good and righteous belting when deserved.
<BR>

<BR>
I have had a close look at my computer's hard disk since reading your article, and did not find any of the programs you mentioned, however I did find an application called "Gator", which sounds like some porn site was trying to infiltrate my computer system.  I promptly deleted the file.  I also found a program called "AVP" that had been installed by my son (I found this out after I grilled him).  I explained that AVP was written by a Russian KGB agent, and that it stands for "A Virus Programmer" - it is evil, anti-American software that is designed to accept foreign viruses, worms and trojan horses that are used to track and report on our computer usage to the Communists.
<BR>

<BR>
I had a close look at the hardware in our system.  We had an NVidia GeForce2 GTS graphics Accelerator card, which contains a GPU (Guessing Password Unit).  I thought carefully about this, and decided to remove and destroy this Video card and replace it with an earlier TNT2 MX64 graphics card which contains no such hacking aids.
<BR>
I did check under my children's beds for magazines of questionable content, such as Dolly and PC User, and the numerous illegal books you mentioned, and found none of these.  I found a Victoria's Secrets catalog under my son's bed, and after questioning him about it, he said he was hiding it from his sister, as he didn't think it appopriate for her, and was about to throw it out.  Elizabeth has just turned 15.  It appeared to have had some hand creme spilled on it, and I decided against questioning her about this, leaving this to her mother - I do not believe it is appropriate for a father to talk to his daughter about lingerie.
<BR>

<BR>
Like with the television, I restrict my children's computer time to 2 hours per day.  I make sure they watch only Christian television shows, and do not let them watch television on Sundays - and no computer on Sundays, either.
<BR>

<BR>
I do not allow my children to play computer games at all as I feel they are all Satan's tools promoting killing and low moral standards.  I also, as do you, believe that Quake is a hacker training "virtual reality" tool, and that it is not appropriate in a Christian home.
<BR>
I had my concerns about Linux, BSD and those sort of "free" operating systems.  Microsoft claims they are going to corrupt society, and I believe this.  That Linux Torovoltos should be put in the same category as Mr Bin Ledan.
<BR>
I am glad I read your article, and took a closer look at my computer system and what it could be used for.  I'm glad my children do not show signs of "Internet Hacker Addiction".  It would not be nice to have to call the police and report them for hacking into banks and other businesses.  I'm glad I bought a processor that leaves its serial number all over the Internet and is easy to trace.
<BR>

<BR>
I strongly urge all other Christian parents to change their ISP to AOL so that a lot of the Internet content is inaccessible to you and your childres, and to remove those "hacker" video cards.

and as far as dual displays go.. i dont even bother.. i simply have 3 seperate systems going at once, one to jerk around on, one todo html/graphics and my laptop which i'm using with my wireless network infstructure to carry around the house to surf the net and hook up to my big screen and watch vcd's... and i am far froma hacker.

I must say it's pathetic when some uneducated parent pretends to have a clue and spreads this horsecrap onto a web site.  Changing ISP's is the smartest thing to do.  Most Americans use AOL because they don't know any better.  If any other ISP spent as much money advertising and mailing sample CD's to the entire free world, then they may be the #1 provider.  How is he soo 110% sure that it was his son who installed the Comet Cursor and Bonzai Buddy.  No respectable computer user would put those programs on their machine.  I think he's covering for another child in the family.  As for upgrading - if you want the fastest framerates in the latest games, that's the price you pay.  I'm sure I'd be willing to pay Compaq's outrageous prices for slightly inferior hardware with a lesser warranty (i.e. generic GF3 vs. retail-boxed Leadtek GF3Ti500).  
<BR>

<BR>
AMD being a "a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip!" is probably the sticking point of proving how thoroughly uneducated the author of this article is.  I'm going to forward this to AMD and allow them to take this site down due to defamation of character among other legitimate legal charges.  No telling how many unknowledgable parents actually became less educated reading this article.
<BR>

<BR>
Programming with Perl isn't strictly a hacker's handbook.  Many people incorporate Perlscript in web sites.  Unless the kid spends 17-20 out of 24 hours each day in front of the computer, let him be.  With the knowledge he clearly possesses, he'll be making 10x more $$ than his father ever will!
<BR>

<BR>
Quake... uh oh... I was playing Quake... I'm feeling violent... can't stop trembling... ;-).  Once again, someone who must be in Liebermann's back pocket... hey everyone, let's go on a crusade to stop violent video games from being played ;-).  Quake I-III is to the current generation as Combat is to the Atari 2600 generation.. I can't help it if 4-8 bit graphics couldn't render 3d in a semi-realistic manner... and how many people decided they were going to fly an F-16 or steal a tank after playing Combat??  
<BR>

<BR>
Children naturally become argumentative with parents in later teenhood because parents are overly nebby and never really LISTEN to what their children are saying... give him some space since you OBVIOUSLY didn't listen to him previously (especially with this "super-sleuthed" article that was written.
<BR>

<BR>
If the author was so smart, he would have spell-checked this article... I hate to inform him of how uneducated he is, but Linux is a great operating system for those who REALLY want control over their computers.  When the CLI faded with the advent of the Windows platform, people have become lazy when it comes to computers.  Editing batch and system files has become lore of the past.  Linux allows ideas to grow and provides the stability in an OS that was available to consumers well before WinXP came out...
<BR>

<BR>
The author has mistaken the Hollywood presentation of hackers for the real life examples.  Did Kevin Mitnick ever wear "baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks"??  Most high school kids that claim to be l33t h@x0r$ are simply "script kiddies" that couldn't write an app to save their lives... I do give credit to those who have honed the craft and use it for purposes of further enlightenment, but the random credit-card generating kiddies know who they are.
<BR>

<BR>
As the child advances through grades in high school, classes will get harder.  Fact of life... unless the author would like his son to stop what he's doing and become a garbage man, he should allow him to have a tutor.
<BR>

<BR>
This article made me sick and I think I'll forward it to the appropriate companies in the slight hope that this no-talent parent-wannabe will be silenced or fined..<BR><BR></FONT></td>

AMD is third world based and a rip off of Intel? Looks like you have been brainwashed to the point of ignorance. Baggy clothes n glowsticks? Hacker no, Pilled up raver - possibly haha. 
<BR>
Do you even know what Bonzai buddy is? its a big on screen chimp that tells you jokes. Do yiou know what comet cursor is? Its so you can have custom cursors. 
<BR>
Sounds like you have touched upon peer 2 peer file sharing utilities too there, although you evidently have never used them nor understand why people use them. 
<BR>
To be honest you sound like a complete authoritarian who has probably raised kids who will also lack personality and any form of intelligence above what you have passed to them (which sounds pretty sub-standard to me).
<BR>

<BR>
If i hadn't had the freedom to investigate the internet freely i would have never developed the skills i have now and ended up in a job with IT. By the sounds of things all your siblings will become are librarians, road sweepers and hairdressers, dying in the same little town they grew up in and possibly getting married to some relative or friend, thus narrowing the gene pool distribution even further and producing even more stupid generations of kids from your lineage.<BR>

And quake is a hacking community?  Geez...its like saying Asteroids is a training ground for terrorist pilots or something.  You are uninformed about computers and their use, its too bad because it's people like you that blame their problems on everything else without taking the blame for their own actions.

Some times I think it's amizing, even in America, that somebody can actually write lies and half truths down in the same article and it be "ok".  This "author" and "website" is lucky if Matrox doesn't sue the HELL out of them for defemation and slander, I know I would.  There is no reason why a computer "hacker" would need a fast new video card... wake up call, THIS IS NOT THE MATRIX!  Most "hacking" is done on a command line prompt(ie Dos), not in some virtual fantasy training ground.  Quake is not a "training ground" IT IS A GAME!  If the "author" would have played the game(and has ever fired a real weapon to compare) he would see that it is made for FUN.  The reason that many people dislike AOL(and other "safe" service providers) is that they are SLOW and made for the "slow" people that can not operate a computer without big shiny buttons to tell them what to do!  Linux is not a "hacking software" but is an open source operating system that many people use because 1)  Many forms of it are FREE, and 2) It can be edited on it's lowest levels to provide more performance to the computer(and "hacking" video cards and video GAMES such as Quake).  And the last time I checked PERL was not a "hacking" language, but a legitimate computer programming language.  In fact most decent web pages have some sort of perl running on the page, or on the backend(that's on the web server for you "slow" people out there).  It could be that the "authors" son was a computer hacker, but it's sounds like the "author" needs a reality check.  This article makes broad assumptions with little facts, many of wich are untrue.  If people are really interested in computer hacking and wondering if thier child could be a computer hacker, they should go to websites like http://project.honeynet.org that actually talk about REALcomputer hacking.  I'm afraid to even look at another article at this site, less I see that it is not just this "author" that is insane.

"If your son starts requesting higher powered water pistols there should be great cause for concern.  You must especially be aware of the infamous "Super Soaker" as it it a very powerful water-slinging weapon.  They use this advanced weaponry in what they call "water fights".

Furthermore I have been monitoring my son and using your simple rules oh supreme justice. I noticed all of the above tendencies. Including frequenting pornography sites, which werent to bad might i add. But were quite vulgar, you know the good stuff. but more to the point i found out finally that he was a hacker! And boy was I pissed. He wasnt even a good hacker, i mean the most he could do was find out how to crack software. Nothing big like going into confidential files that people dont want you to see. So i punished his ass, with a severe beating like you suggested. I threw out all his clothes and bought him bright clothing, because you said all hackers do so, and i made him cut his hair and make it spikey as well as die it a bright pink. Just like you suggested hackers do. I made him go hang out with the other hacker looking kids, i did everything to incourage him using your advice about how hackers act look and dress. I waited and waited like a mother bird anxious to see its young, but to no avail my son did not improve his hacking skills. All he became was this so called "raver" who goes to those "Rave Dances" and uses those glowy things what are they called cheese sticks... no thats not right... ummmmm.... alien lights.... well you know what i mean. So thats all i wanted to report thanks for your great assesment of hackers, and an adequate depiction of what all hackers look like, act like, and are. Thanks for your time.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You're son is ofcourse not going to talk to. Through reading this article your personality sounds extremely naive and arrogant, not to add extremely pathetic.

Your son sounds like a rave bunny, refering to the way you describe he dresses. I think after only a few days of research of computer hacking that you should not and cannot make a judgement. Because you're judgements are extremely wrong, and quite simply i'll laugh til my heart is content if you are sued by the manufactors of these software providers.

And as for those "Lunix" claims, you are way off base. It is actually Linux and it is an operating system like Windows, you cannot install it on Windows, it needs its own partition (in general) and it was created by Linus Tolvalds, based on MINUX created by Microsoft. And BSD, Mandrake and Debian are THE biggest powers in the Linux world, they ARE NOT illegal by any standard. They are as legal as Microsoft.

He claims if they have Flash installed on a computer, they are a hacker. Last time I checked Flash is a multimedia display program, so he is claiming that everyone, like Joecartoon.com, Marvel.com, or WWF.com are hackers? Somehow I don't think so. I think this guy needs to actually look at his ideas again. BTW Quake is a GAME, plain and simple.

<BR>
And as for those "Lunix" claims, you are way off base. It is actually Linux and it is an operating system like Windows, you cannot install it on Windows, it needs its own partition (in general) and it was created by Linus Tolvalds, based on MINUX created by Microsoft. And BSD, Mandrake and Debian are THE biggest powers in the Linux world, they ARE NOT illegal by any standard. They are as legal as Microsoft.

Grow up mate and do some serious research cos most of your points were completely wrong.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Any of his statements regarding many of the companies and people (AMD, Linus Torvolds (who is Finnish I believe and called a Fin russian is  akin to calling a Canadian America) for example) if published in any other media (print, tv, radio) would result in a storm of libel suits.  As his statements were expressed as such and not as 'opinions'.
<BR>

<BR>
Even more frightening is T Reginald Gibbons total lack of understanding of the subject he was pontificating about.
<BR>

<BR>
A fine example: "..They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops.." Anyone who had spent 15 minutes researhcing microprocessor poduction methods would be made extremely aware how stupid this concept is.  I am glad that I am not German, as having my country described as "third world" is unbelievably insulting (lets hope Mr Gibbons does not drive an Audi, VW, BMW or Mercedes  eh?).
<BR>

<BR>
My one last hope is that this article is a superb exercise in satire

I hate to tell you this but your computer is a compaq. 80 percent of all compaqs use amd processors. Amd is the processor choice for most computer applications. Number too Bonzi buddy is not a hacking program is a file program you can get accidently from some websites when you sign up for a free service like email for instance. Number 3 if your son can even get Linux booted Ill be amazed. Dont shoot something down untill you know all the facts. The point is if your son was a hacker you would have never have found out!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

All you have to do is read about all the security holes in all of their software. Hell, you don't even have to read about it!!

This was the biggest waste of a web page!  "DOSing?" Umm no.  DoS is more commonly know as a Denial of Service attack in which it prevents users from accessing a web site, not opening the command prompt on other peoples computers!  
<BR>

<BR>
Another point, Windows is an infeior hacking platform, UNIX or Linux would be a better choice. 
<BR>

<BR>
A faster Video Card? For what? A video card that can dispaly a maxium of 640x480 screen resolution is suffienct enough to hack. Faster hardware means nothing, the best hackers where people using 486's with 2800 baud modems, the speed of the computer has little to do with hacking, more of it is in the mind of the hacker himself.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, the fashion?  Look into the Rave Culture, everyone dresses as such, we carry glo sticks, pacifiers, wear baggy pants, and dress in bright colors thats the scene.  
<BR>

<BR>
Do some research b4 flying off at the mouth! ;-)

(And for those of you who just arent sure, just read a few posts.  You'll find some things that he wrote about he just plain wouldn't know were he actually as unintelligent as he appeared to be.  The irony is amazing.)
<BR>

<BR>
You obviously have talent sir.......
<BR>

<BR>
What I do wanna know is where I can find more? This is the Blair Witch Project of writing. This guy was obviously either patient enough to write and think this whole article out, or just got really bored and began to write away.
<BR>

<BR>
And I personally believe he took a while to write this out.
<BR>

<BR>
However, I do understand why you cannot come forth and be recognized for 80% of the people on this board will eat you alive with annoying "put-down" posts letting you know how stupid you are when in fact, your probably one of the most intellegent writers in the country. (or the world for that matter)
<BR>

<BR>
Anyhow, unfortunatly I doubt you will ever read this post since there are so many "negitive" posts out weighing the "positive" posts.
<BR>

<BR>
But if you do......
<BR>

<BR>
Kudos to you sir and Im sure you are proud of your work for you have certainly caused a "posting riot". And please email me at cgreesonc@yahoo.com for more. I would love to share a laugh. =)

<BR>
My son, Osama, is a computer hacker.
<BR>
i have tried every means necessary to try and get him off his addictions with hacking software, but it is all to no avail.
<BR>
After many years of hacking, Osama was found and convicted with crimes against computing, and sentenced to 3 years jail.
<BR>
When he came out of jail, he started up a computer terrorist organization known as the Taliban.
<BR>
After numerous encounters with opposing forces, Osama was named America's Most Wanted Man.
<BR>
My son, is the most wanted man in the world.
<BR>
I feel ashamed to have brought him his first Macintosh.
<BR>
i urge parents to be more aware of their childrens activities, as you may have a computer hacker living in your very own house, that can cause immense pain and suffering to those who love him very much.

Luckily my parents with the help of the school nurse, and the PE teacher, were able to put me in a controlled safe environment, and correctly diagnose that I was afflicted with ADD.
<BR>

<BR>
Now that I am under a strong prescription, I have no desire to "surf the web" or "download mp3s".  In fact I spend a lot more of my time now just sitting and stareing out into space relaxing and enjoying the simple pleasure of existing without desire to do anything.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes I occasionally get on the computer and Internet, but only using AOL and only while supervised by a court ordered adult.  Luckily AOL keeps me safe from most of the evil and addicting parts of the internet.

This is ridiclous. If I had AOL, I would get rid of it as soon as possible, because performance is so low. Hackers don't need a better video card, except for playing computer games. AMD processers are equal (and perhaps better) to Intel's chips in processing speed. Your child may simply want better performance, and besides AMD is cheaper. They don't use "child labor" in producing the chips. The only way you could produce a processer is with machines. Just because a child is on the computer for long periods of time doesn't mean that he/she is hacking. More than 30 minutes on the computer??? THIS IS ABSURD. Try playing a computer game for 30 minutes... You won't even get half of a game done. The article also mentioned the books "Cryptomycon" and "Snow Crash", both written by Neal Stephenson and "Neuromancer" written by William Gibson. None of these are "hacking manuals". I have read all of these, and they are wonderful books. Besides, there is virtually no knowledge in there that would help your child become a hacker. Becoming a hacker isn't something you can just learn instantly. Perhaps your younger daughter "Cindy" is simply fabricating all of this. In my opinion, you are just being paranoid.

I was so furious and after discussions with our parish preist and the school counsellors, we were advised to throw away the AMD-XP 1800 system we recently purchased and got an apple iMac computer
<BR>
which we were told would prevent our son from hacking and viewing pornographic material.
<BR>
So we suggest that all parents purge your 
<BR>
household's of those evil PC computer's and be safe by using Macintosh (i'm told you cant hack with a Mac).
<BR>
Also be very very concered if your child 
<BR>
has an E-mail address that ends with @hotmail.com

I've been told that devil worshipers and pedofiles hang out at the Hotmail place.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Do you really think that this is "enlightened" (as you wrote) attitude? I have to disappoint you, because it isn't. In the first place, it means that you really know what you are talking about. In the second, it also means that you know about many other things in the world and not just those within a 2km-radius around your home.
<BR>

<BR>
And people like you want to make themselves to the ideals of other parents - or in wider perspective, to all people of the world? People who don't have and don't even want to have any deeper ideas about anything that isn't Microsoft - or in a greater scale, that isn't American? :(
<BR>

<BR>
I'm truly disappointed... But at least now I know the truth.

I recommend you to open your eyes and dare to look over the coastal horizons. Behold the world. Then think about yourself.

"Sex is humans at their most animalistic. Sex is not human.

"As a fervent home handyman, I conduct over one hundred volts of alternating current several times a year, occasionally through my teeth. It isn't so much a crack as it is a powerful buzzing sensation that feels something like being punched repeatedly and very rapidly at the point of contact. That's an insufficient description, but it is a very unusual sensation. It isn't over instantly. It takes a while to kill you, or else I would be dead several times over."
<BR>

<BR>
Way to shock yourself several times a year moron. Heres an idea, why dont you just turn the fucking breaker off? DUH! If you dont know which one it is, just tap the black and white wires together briefly and the breaker will pop. If you see any red wires I'd advise you not to screw with them, because you'll eventually end up dead if you shock yourself enought with 220 volts of "alternating current".

<BR>
I have used the computer for 6+ years and i am currently 18 years old
<BR>
I started when i was about 11 years old
<BR>
origonally i didnt know much but i slowly grew in knowledge, just fiddling with it, playing games and whatnot
<BR>
my parents never learned as fast as i did towwards computers, and my step father is a piping engineer that uses computers all day long, but he does not know much, but he knows more then you sir.
<BR>
I have learned so much from fiddling, reading, and asking questions from people.
<BR>
And one thing i have learned is EVERYTHING IN THIS ARTICLE IS A LIE. first of all its not spelled LUNIX its LINUX
<BR>
now all those programs that you have just "deleted" on your family computer are harmless, and considering i am now working for a well respected company (Memory Express) my credit is not out of place.
<BR>
First of all i would like to say that what you are currently running is windows, most likely, now Linux is similar to Windows in the fact that it is what we called an "operating system" where it can be used to run the computer PROPERLY, sure linux can be used for hacking, but so can windows, any and all versions of windows and all operating systems can be used for hacking, i know this as i myself have hacked, but not on the high levels this ignorant father (in the article) refers to.
<BR>
Now regarding your reply to this article, sir, If you ever want to get anywhere in this world you better fucking wake up to the reality that is computers, for if you want to succeed in ANY way shape and form you had better learn how to use one, instead of deleting these programs off of your computer, how about you ask your child to teach you about computers, considering he knows far more then you.
<BR>
Everything in this world now relies on computers, in one way or another, you cannot escape the growth of technology.
<BR>
Your deletion of these related programs were out of fear and ignorance, is life really that easy to live in a small box fearing whatever is outside the box? frankly i dont think so...
<BR>
so grow up, and face your fucking ignorance!

<BR>

<BR>
1) Either the author is deliberately lying or so completely ibecilic that they cannot even gather acceptable data.
<BR>

<BR>
2) Completely paranoid about the "big scary computer machine".
<BR>

<BR>
3) Should not be allowed to birth--let alone raise!--children.  (I am curious, when the child plays with his thumb and forefinger and says "bang", do you cart him off to the doctor to have the hand removed, lobotomize the child and then move to another nation and assume false identities?)
<BR>

<BR>
All I can say is, I hope the author's child survives the complete destruction of their psyche at the hands of this paranoid schizophrenic with psychotic and sociologic tendencies they have for a mother!

The AMD corporation, regardless of what you think of it's business practices, is NOT an illegal processor. The ARE sold in stores and in no way circumvent any security measures. The very idea that they could do so is ludicrous. Lunix, Mandrake, etc. are all linux-based operating systems. Linux is entirely legal, and was NOT invented by a Russian hacker, but rather by STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Quake is an online game, not a 'virtual world'. While it is certainly violent, it is not a 'training ground for hackers'. Also, the idea of using DOS to hack a computer is crazy. A server that would be susceptible to such an attack would have to be extremely lax with it's security, to the point of being several years behind the mainstream. Don't read this garbage, and definitely don't believe it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Most amazing is how many people think it's serious, and how many people who have posted joke replies have been mistaken for being serious.  Has no one got a sense of humour here?

Maybe its another symtom to look for, when people lose a sense of humour it's because they've been hacking?  After all, computers don't have a sense of humour!  Hey, I could be on to something here...like the conspiracy conspiracy....have you ever wondered where all the conspiracy theories come from?  Could it be because <i>THEY</i> are trying to distract us from the real conspiracies?? ;-)

<BR><BR>
I think it is splendid how such a man takes the time to not only look after his children, but also to inform other <a href="http://www.penpalworld.com/concernedparent.html">concerned parents</a> of the signs to watch out out for. Proudly I can say that my children have none of the characteristics except for the long hours of using the computer, which I immediately restricted. Although they resisted at first, they go <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/">outside</a> more often now and enjoy a youth without crime.
<BR><BR>
As gratefulness for all the research, I have done some myself, and found there is a very good cure for young hackers. Just go <a href="http://www.deathandhell.com/">here</a>.
<BR><BR>
That is the answer!
<BR><BR>
And as a last note: don't let yourself be conceived by all those that imply this is a joke or things are not true. I have asked one of my well respected friends, who has outstanding job in the ICT business and he verified that all these signs are legitimate. Frankly I'm quite shocked how cleverly others try to disguise the sincerity of this man.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
They even have their own language! called 'L337 5P34|&lt;' (Elite Speak)

here is the the link to theire site:

&lt;A href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Syndicate for Hackers!&lt;/A&gt;

<BR>
Also i have found most of these 'l337' people also play an unsociable game called 'Counter-Strike' beware that most people who play this game wish to wage war in afghanistan killing islamic fundamentalists members and use this game to train for war.

windows upon every reboot checks it and replaces it with a new one if its missing or corrupt...... which is pointless really because windows 98 has absolutly no use for it... unles u enjoy trying to run dos programs through the tiny dos shell that 98 has....which is fun for all of 5 seconds when every dos program ever made dies due to the fact it hates running in dos through windows.....
<BR>

<BR>
also this is most likely because windows 98 doesnt contain 6.22 in actual fact it a half arsed cut to pieces version...... if u don't belive me...get a book on dos commands and see how many u can run before it says..... Bad Command Or File Name... oh about 50 where as ur trusty 6.22 commands book will have 10x that in it.... oh and about ur hacking......sheesh i just like to say

A cracker is the scummy type of person you are referring to whilst a hacker is someone who is able to program and understand how computers work which if you think about it is really quite useful because if we didn;t have these sort of people you wouldn't have been able to make a fool of yourself on the internet by writing such a load of crap.

He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>

<BR>
HAHAH What a Joke Comet Cursor is a Program to change your mouse Cursor to Something a little bit nicer than the original Cursor. (not even close to hacking) Bonzi buddy HAHAH What a joke All bonzi buddy is, is a program for People who dont know how to use computers It allows you to Interact and talk to your PC.. Oh and Flash..

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I read this article and was... stunned. At first, I thought it was just a joke site. The knee-jerk response to this is amazing... Contrary to popular opinion, online games are NOT all hacker-infested swap meets. Nor does wanting a top of the line system mean that you are using it for hacking. For instance, there are a lot of video clips and animated shorts that are available online. Having a good video card means you can access them. _I_ have an AMD K6 processor in my computer... My eMachine, I might add. The processor doesn't mean you can hack easily or not... frankly, AMD's are like Pentiums, only 1/3 the cost. Rather than reacting because you /think/ someone /might/ be doing something, try some of the famous ghosting programs used by companies. Or try monitoring by sharing what your children are doing online. I have never broken the law, and I have a good computer, and a decent ISP. AOL is rotten because you get booted all the time, it's overpriced, and you are spammed with things you don't want to get. I can't blame someone for wanting to change. Try TALKING to your child, rather than jumping into accusations.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
