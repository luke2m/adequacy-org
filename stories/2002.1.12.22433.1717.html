		<p>For years, I have fought against homosexual organizations such as <a href="http://www.glaad.org/">GLAD</a>, the <a href="http://www.rainbowpush.org/">Rainbow Coalition</a>, and <a href="http://www.nambla.com/">NAMBLA</a> for morality and decency. Some might call me a homophobe or a bigot, but I am merely a man of ethics. I am not closed minded, for I would be happy to accept the homosexual lifestyle if homosexuals would simply clear up their act. Below, I list what traits homosexuals contain that must be be destroyed before I will accept the homosexuality as a part of society.        </div>

<p><b>Stop Hurting Women</b></p>
<p>As everybody knows, homosexuals run the fashion industry. In an attempt to spread homosexuality, they are trying to ruin women by turning them into bolemic crack whores. If you continue this, I will have no choice but to declare war upon your kind.</p>
<p><b>Apologize for AIDS</b></p>
<p>I know liberals love to pretend that homosexuals were the ones mostly responsible for the spreading of AIDS, but that will not change the past. Simply apologize for killing all the victims of AIDS.</p>
<p><b>Stop Trolling</b></p>
<p>As one who loves to read <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">intelligent forums</a>, I am deeply bothered by the excessive amount of trolling done on such wonderful message boards. After studying the trolls, I have realized that they tend to be sleazy homosexuals. Stop ruining great forums!</p>
<p><b>Stop Molesting Children</b></p>

1.Straight people kiss on tv, and you don't hear homosexuals complaining, so live and let live, they don't care if you kiss on tv why should you care if they do. Also if you don't like something DON'T WATCH IT.
<BR>

2. RIGHT, yes it is really homosexuals who are making women get sick not the fact that all the models are skinny and more importantly not that straight men WANT them to look like that.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Hmm so then will you please appologize to the guy you caughed near and gave the flu to when you were 5.  Seriously, it is not the fault of homosexuals, right now more straight people have it than not, and moreover there is no one to be blamed for the actions of a virus.

2. Straight men, at least those who haven't been overly influenced by the female hating liberal feminists and homos, want women of sufficient heft to bear a normal sized brood without undue suffering. These emaciated models with their narrow hips could maybe give birth to two, possibly three, children before completely wrecking their bodies and rendering themselves unable to do the work required to rear the kids.<BR><BR>
3. The fact is that homosexuals were originally innocluated with the AIDS virus. It would have been contained within their population had it not been for a few deviant-beyond-belief sexual predators who 'went both ways'. Of course your statement that more heterosexuals have the virus than homosexuals is blatantly false, as the statistics you use were likely propagated by the homosexual community.<BR><BR>
5. Homosexuals do not have a lower instance of abusing their children than heterosexuals. A child is being abused every single second he spends with a homosexual as the child is being exposed to a lifestyle that will leave him morally bankrupt and rejected from the Kingdom of God.<BR><BR>

<BR>
Homossexuality has always existed, all around the worlds, and more or less in the same percentage.
<BR>

<BR>
It's a transhistorical, transcultural and transgeographical phenomena, therefore, it's not a desiase, sin, or crime. The fact that a woman feels sexually and/or emotionally attracted towards another woman (and the same goes for men) doesn't make her invade anyone's space, nor will she kill for that, or hurt, or rob, or develop a virus.
<BR>

<BR>
It all ends up in the society you live in, everybody knows that amongst the greeks, 3000 years BC it was widely accepted, it was a cultural behaviour (within certain parameters and rules), nowdays the level of acceptance goes from 0, where homossexuals are killed, like in Egypt, to complete, where they can marry, have granted exactely the same rights as heterossexuals, even child adoption, as where I live, in the Netherlands (for the ignorants who have no clue where it is, it's what you call Holland, between France, Belgium and Germany, in Europe).
<BR>

<BR>
Here has been more than proved that homossexuals are not less healthy, less productive, less respectfull... the police even makes campaigns to recruit homossexual policemen (women) because they tend to be more friendly (that doesn't mean that they're trying to harrass).
<BR>

<BR>
That is yet another point, homossexual harrassement at work has been nearly undocumented, as heterossexual harrassement is daily.
<BR>

<BR>
Being a christian myself, I wouldn't say that God would condemn anyone who showed respect to their neighbourt kill, steal, or hurt, just because one loves the same gender. That only shows hipocritical moral and ignorance.
<BR>

<BR>
The person who wrote the previous comment should consult psichological guidance.

<BR>
I am sorry if my english is not perfect, if someone is bothered about it... then I would defy him to have a nice dialog with me in Dutch, Spanish, French, Italian, German and Portuguese.

Paganism has nothing to do with homosexuality or anything else like it.  In fact, if you were to actually RESEARCH any form of paganism, you'll find no reference to any sexual preference of any kind.  Matter of fact, you won't find any references to any 10 commandments, thousands of psalms and other meaningless dribble that pour out of the mouths of such pathetic attempts at religion.
<BR>

<BR>
If religion were something more than foolish pride and a way of explaining away your faults, I would probably consider paganism at it's best.  But at the moment, religion ( in all of it's forms, paganism is none the better ) is just a form of mind control.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

First a lesson in logic: All men are humans, but not all humans are men!
<BR>
What you have attempted to pass off as a reasoned argument is nothing greater than a logical fallacy (I believe of Composition, though I do not have the education of many esteemed readers).  I posted "Any religion worth its salt has clearly denounced homose*uality and all of the pagan vices that surrounds it." I DID NOT post "all pagans are homose*uals."  Please spend a moment or two actually reading the posts you choose to respond to and a few more moments actually trying to comprehend them.
<BR>

<BR>
(you wrote) "Matter of fact, you won't find any references to any 10 commandments, thousands of psalms..."
<BR>

<BR>
Of course I wont find references to the 10 commandments or psalms in Pagan propaganda for the Truth burns like hot sand in Satan's mouth.
<BR>

<BR>
As for researching Paganism:  I don't need to pollute my mind with lies.  Neither will I entertain researching "The moon shots were faked," "The HAARP Project," "Area 51," "Seat Belts Save Lives," or other liberal lies designed to separate me from G*d.

<BR>
I suggest you take a few moments and meet with your local minister.  If you are concerned with mind control, I'm sure he will permit you to wear your tin foil hat while he counsels you.

If you don't believe me, try putting up a post with no nickname or password and you'll get the name 'anonymous reader.'  I'm in no way a schitzophrenic, and besides, schitzo's are unable to HAVE lives.

Also, because you clearly refuse to research paganism you choose one form of pointless, and uninformed propaganda over the source itself.  That's proof of ignorance right there, so refrain from making references to any kind ( without a proper source ) to paganism because you know nothing.

You won't find references to psalms and what-not because psalms are just pointless quotes that mean very little ( if not nothing ), and because the 10 commandments are younger than Paganism.

Keep religion out of this, its not wanted and holds little meaning. I've seen little to no trouble in the religious topics on this website (as much as I'd like to jump in I refrain from doing so, because the thread is obviously geared towards it and its not my place), but every religious nut out there feels s/he has the right to jump in on every topic around. Let's sort this rubbish out once and for all:

Let's, for arguments sake, say God is against gays. 10% of nature is homosexual. But God created nature. Therefore God is fallible. But God can't be fallible. Therefore God ceases to exist. Simple.

Typical Atheist garbage.  The vanity of man often leads to his downfall.  I will never understand why Atheists are so vain that they cannot imagine anything larger and more powerful than themselves.  
<BR>

<BR>
As for religion holding little meaning to this argument, surely you are kidding.  BILLIONS of people live within the codified ethics of some religious apparatus (I am keen on saying significantly more people live with religion than without, but I don't have that statistic available).  As I have said before, every viable religion has a prohibition against homose*uality.  Just because it doesn't fit within your narrow  SoHo coffee house view, we cannot discard the MOST HISTORICALLY INFLUENCIAL FORCE.
<BR>

<BR>
While I appreciate your syllogism, it is fatally flawed and I wonder if it was accidental.  First: G*d is "against " (prohibits, condemns) homose*uality in Man.  Man (and most women) has a soul and that significantly separates him from animals.  G*d's law governs the behaviors of people and not of animals.  Second, I highly doubt 10% of nature is homose*ual as on a number by number basis ase*ual reproduction staggers se*ual reproduction.  Some "scientists" have documented a few erratic incidences of homose*ual contact in lower animals, and while they are few (very few) and far between I cannot deny them.  Similarly, there are documented incidences of cannibalism, incest, and self-abuse in the animal world.  While I cannot claim to understand them, I understand G*d's plan is greater than my limited mental faculties.  That is to say, your syllogism needs a caveat of "And G*d (and G*d's works) are not fully comprehensible to mortal man.

Although I am not a doctor I recommend you drink more water, avoid more radiation, go outside into the sunlight, and praise G*d for the gifts He has given you.

Women grinding crotches together? Bring it on! :)

<BR>
Let's start at the basics: social construction. Have you ever thought how much heterosexuality is bombarding our worlds? Whether you go in the west you will see it, from the images of Britney Spears to the way a house is designed. Sexuality and gender infilitrate our ever day. However, because you (and I) are heterosexual, we are unable to fully appreciate this. We take everything around us as the norm. Have you thought what its like for homosexuals to walk down a street, knowing that society does not permit them to hold hands like regular couples?
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Stop Hurting Women&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
Is this a joke? I'm not a fashion expert, but I'd like to see you produce some stats on fashion designers and homosexuality before you make such a statement. Furthermore, the high level  designers have little impact on our everyday. Most of our clothing is designed by major corporations.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Apologize for AIDS&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
AIDS came from a polio vaccine. Its not homosexuals who spread the virus, but careless people. There's a difference.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Stop Trolling&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
Can't say I've experienced it. Perhaps you  are visiting forums intended for homosexuals to gather and speak. On top of which, if we can discuss heterosexual activities (this includes those such as sport, particularly ones such as football - yes it is very much a heterosexual activity, reinforcing hetero "norms") then why can't they discuss their's?
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Stop Molesting Children&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
Homosexuals don't molest children, disturbed people do. There's a difference.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I was hoping you'd ask. :) Here's a very simple breakdown:
<BR>

<BR>
Take your simple two/three bedroom house. Let's look at the rooms. Three bedrooms tends to imply a family, something that homosexuals are unlikely to have (not impossible, but highly unlikely). Look at the layout of the rooms. The kitchen is placed to the back, reinforcing heterosexual male dominating powers, pushing female and homosexual powers to the back, the unseen part of the house. The idea of the bathroom was developed again through such relations. It is designed to be unseen, tucked away from the outside world. Concepts of bathing have been linked with the female gender, and are not seen to be very male and heterosexual. The point is such planning has been designed to reinforce the male domination of the household This was particularly important as work and home became seperated in the industrial revolution. With men competing in the workplace, they required a secondary area, the home, where they would remain dominant and unchallenged. What's really specific is that the idea is to push male heterosexual powers, and this in turn conflicts with female and homosexual issues. Everything is a social construction and everything has cultural politics attached to it. There is nothing that "just is".
<BR>

<BR>
Before anyone goes ape on me (and starts calling me a lesbian feminist), I am a heterosexual male, I have just come across these studies during my degree and find them quite interesting. There is also work regarding this from everything from urban planning to the layout of bars.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

They advocate building and designing 'not-so-big' houses, in which the space is planned toward the lifestyles of the residents and on a human scale. The house is customized and made more luxurious (if so desired) through the use of detail instead of wasted space. For example, a custom, beautifully designed kitchen can become the focal point of an open first floor plan, since people tend to congregate there anyway.  It's kind of a cool idea.
<BR>

<BR>
The one obvious drawback is that if a house is so customized to one owner's tastes, it'll be harder to sell later on. But what the hell - I don't own a house anyway, so what do I know???

Speculations on Housing, Urban Design, and Human Work</i>, published in 1980.

<BR><BR>
And yes, you are talking about Architectural Determinism, you just don't realize it. You are making the usual mistake of sociology by confusing correlation with causation.
<BR><BR>
Architecture is a reactionary field. It <i>responds</i> to external events and human desires. It does <b>not</b> create them. Further, 
architecture can not encourage any activity unless there is a <i>prexisting</i> desire for it. And in the case of home design I can absolutely assure you that the desires of women play a far greater role than those of the men, in the past as well as today.
<BR><BR>
You are creating the usual feminist demon of Heterosexual Male Conspiracy to explain something that is far too complex to be deliberately orchestrated. As for the kitchen and other areas typically reserved for women being isolated, this is where the <i>women</i> wanted those things, and they are generally seen as things that <i>empowered</i> housewives by giving them a zone of control that was not to be challenged by men.
<BR><BR>
You are blaming the design of inanimate objects for contributing to social development when it is social development that dictates the design of inanimate objects. You are asserting premeditation where the responsible parties are mearly reacting, and you are attributing a negative connotation to something that you have no direct experience with. And that, my friend, is crap.

Hahaha. Yeah, I know your kind and seen your limited contributions in the literature. I won't deny these are feminist thoughts, but to no surprise, you, like most people, have no idea what feminism is about. Its not about the "demon of Heterosexual Male Conspiracy". Perhaps you should read up on it more.

What is truly interesting is how far you have slipped from being a "man of ethics" without even realizing.  It saddens me to see that the liberal media has wormed its way into your mind and created the possibility (with or without conditions) of accepting homose*uals into society.  This is a slippery slope, my friend, one that will only result in accepting any degenerate fad lifestyle into our fold.  First we accept homose*uals with some restraints, then slowly we up-right individuals will be inched out by unrepentant, child molesting, women abusing nancy boys until society is over run with deviants.  It happened to Rome, it can happen to us.
<BR>

<BR>
The only true course of action is to draw a firm line and say "NO!" to the homose*ual agenda.  Not an inch, not a mile.  For today they want acceptance, tomorrow equality, and next week your children.  You, sir, are teetering on the brink of that first fate filled step.

[i]Homosexuality could be accepted as a biological fact, but still be rejected socially, on the grounds that it lies outside of a culture's traditional, or preconceived, values and norms. In this way, homosexuality would parallel current societal views of other forms of unacceptable, though often genetically-based, behaviors, such as alcoholism and obesity. [/i]

Its irrelevant to people such as the author of this thread. They will continue to believe what they want even if it stares them blind in the face. Even better is that they have no understanding of the issues at stake, take no time to actually do some research and still believe they are entitled to voice their opinions.

The idea of dividing sexuality into hetero, homo and bi groups is purely a social formation and has not been around since the beginning of time. In Rome, as you refer to it, sexuality was based on class. Individuals were never considered homo or heterosexual. Your class position entitled you to have sex with certain elements of society. Many great men, who helped build Roman and Greek power, for example, were known to take part in homosexual activities (it has no correaltion with the decline of societies). This was a common practice and was not socially hidden or oppressed (as we do today). 
<BR>

Child molesting was not rife in Rome, as you suggest. Neither is it directly linked to homosexuals (numerous abusers are heterosexual).

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Interesting to see that my post had developed two vastly different threads of response.  One claiming homose*uality is genetic and therefore "natural" and another claiming "(homose*uality) is only a recent concept." Although I am not here to debate Genetic vs Behavioral homose*uality, I have kept my eye on the topic for a number of years and would like to share some of my observations:
<BR>

<BR>
First on genetic homose*uality:
<BR>
The end goal of any healthy natural sexual act is procreation, and without procreation eventually all men and women would cease to exist.  Homose*ual unions by definition do not produce progeny and therefore the genetic traits of the "partners" are not continued to the next generation; as the Darwinists would say "The trait is selected out."  Given enough generations, a trait that cannot product viable offspring will be purged from the gene pool.
<BR>

<BR>
Otherwise, genetic homose*uality must arise from genetic mutation.  This genetic mutation then jeopardizes the blood line of the individual, but thanks to modern medical science a genetic disease such as this can be successfully treated through gene thrapy.
<BR>

<BR>
"But if homose*uality is genetic, why cant we just let them be?" Well, sociopaths or other malicious psychic disorders (such as the criminal intellect) are often caused by genetic chemical imbalances in the brain or general malformities in the gross anatomy of the brain. While these conditions may be genetic, or the poor hapless victim is "just born that way," they express behaviors in the individuals that are detrimental to cohesive society.   No, we cannot accept homose*uals' behavior if they are "simply born that way" any more than we can accept someone born with a murderous bloodrage who attacks his neighbors with a kitchen knife.
<BR>

<BR>
On behavioral homose*uality:
<BR>
Behavior homose*uality is fairly simple.  If someone "chooses" to be homose*ual then they are deliberately acting out against G*d and society.  These people are then intentionally acting in a subversive manner and society has an obligation to criminalize the behavior.  Once the State has guardianship of these malcontents, the root cause of their behavior can be treated with therapy, pharmaceuticals, and prayer.
<BR>

<BR>
In the final summation of genetic vs behavioral it doesn't matter as these behaviors are an affront to G*d and moral people.  
<BR>

<BR>
(For my friend Anonymous Reader:  Emperor Nero, often noted as the lynchpin in the fall of Rome, underwent a public homose*ual marriage ceremony c. 60 AD.  The metaphor "Nero fiddled while Rome burned" is clearly a lesson that moral decadence will destroy a healthy and productive society.)
<BR>

<BR>
As a side note: I choose not to put the "x" in homose*uals because I am mature enough to understand that irresponsible parents allow small children to view the internet without adequate supervision.  I attempt to keep these discussions as clean as possible.  Additionally, I understand that some se*ual deviants use a "meta-google search" for "keywords," and I would hate to imagine that someone would use our innocent discussion for self-flagellation.

<BR>

<BR>
Darwin - his theories are not be followed strictly. They no longer apply in our societies today. If we were to follow "evolution" then the first job would be to disband our health service and let those who catch illnesses or suffer accidents, live through it or die. We don't. Socially, sex is also becoming less and less to do with reproduction and more to do with leisure (this idea has been around since the first day a condom was used). And if "God" did  mean for sex to be for nothing more than child bearing, then why are we not guaranteed conception every time we have sex?
<BR>

<BR>
Why are you comparing criminals to homosexuals? There is no logic behind this at all.
<BR>

<BR>
You reference to Nero means jackshit. Just because there is a certain phrase attributed to him does not mean it is because he was a homosexual. Produce evidence indicating the source of this phrase and I might consider it (also bare in mind when it was formed). What about other great leaders, such as Alexander the Great (known to have his male lover follow him around on his conquests)?
<BR>

<BR>
As for your last comment regarding the word "sex", I think you have some serious social problems that need addressing if you can't bring yourself to even type it out. You've got a poor excuse there. How do you know that a search engine would even pick up this discussion board? Have you tried it out? Stop repressing yourself and get out of the closet.

There is no sound evidence for or against homosexuals in the bible, and even IF (note the IF IF IF) God isn't too pleased with them, he wouldn't want us persecuting him. Duh, he sent jesus to die for all sins, and he still wants us to love one another.
<BR>
 So stop giving us a bad name, grow up, and meet an actual homosexual. A good sum of my friends are, and they're actually the nicest of my friends because of all they have to endure, the emotional and mental hardache they go through in our current society, and the resulting strength and courage in the face of pagans such as yourselves.
<BR>
 By the way, I am gay. Just though I might add that tidbit to this stupid conversation. And yes, this thread is completely disgusting me. You don't see me bashing people like you or heterosexuals, do you? Most of my friends are heterosexual and know I'm gay.

<BR>

<BR>
"I'm happy that you all have found your life partners, but nobody wants to see you making out"
<BR>

<BR>
Im fine with it. You see heterosexuals making out all over the place. Especially on TV. If you dun want to see homosexuals making out on TV then take of the heterosexual making out as well.
<BR>

<BR>
"As everybody knows, homosexuals run the fashion industry."
<BR>

<BR>
LOL! ahh..stereotypes. Research THEN speak.
<BR>

<BR>
"they are trying to ruin women by turning them into bolemic crack whores."
<BR>

<BR>
Those women do it to themselves. Simple as that. It has nothing to do with homosexuality. It may turn off some men but if it turns off men by the same token it would also turn off some lesbian women. Hence it's a stalemate and homosexuality remains balanced in that regard.
<BR>

<BR>
"Simply apologize for killing all the victims of AIDS."
<BR>

<BR>
...you're kidding right? Anyone that has AIDS (save for the few born with it or some other fluke) agreed to have sex with the other person that was carrying it. It was their choice to make and they knew that getting an STD was a consequence of their actions.
<BR>

<BR>
"Stop Molesting Children"
<BR>

<BR>
If you actually took some time to research what you're preaching you would know that most criminals (including child molestors, rapists, etc.) are HETEROsexual. 
<BR>

<BR>
All this post looks like to me is a perfect example of the typical human response to fear and slash out at what they dont understand. Take some time to learn what you're talking about and learn to be more tolerant of new things and ideas.

Who knows you may learn something.

If the religious right weren't so Noble, and Righteous, then they would practice what they preach. Tolerance. Isn't it odd that people who claim tolerance only use it when the situation is in their favor? I am tolerant of ANY new idea; for me there is no other way to be. I have gay friends, and guess what? They are productive, contributing citizens. The only flaw in a homosexual relationship that I see is that the two people aren't reproducing themselves.
