		These days, when you hear about problems in the "work environment", it's usually something silly like ergonomics, employees who play their radios too loudly, or fabricated leftivist gobbledygook like the "glass ceiling."  All of these frivolities can distract attention away from <I>real</I> problems in American workplaces, and it is in that spirit that I pose the following question to the readership of <A HREF="../index.html">Adequacy.org</A>:<P>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I was originally going to submit this as a diary entry, but I changed my mind when I began to contemplate the seriousness of this topic. This is something that can (potentially) affect us all, and I want to have a frank and (hopefully) productive discussion with <A HREF="../index.html">Adequacy</A> readers about this situation, and what can be done to rectify it.<P>
This whole thing started when my software development team and I decided to go out for dinner and drinks after work in order to celebrate a recent software release.  We had worked hard on it for several months, and I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to have some fun, blow off some steam, and discuss the months ahead.  After an excellent meal, almost everybody left.  The only people that remained were myself and another developer who has been on the team for several months now.  We retired to the lounge, ordered a few beers, and spent an hour or so "shooting the breeze."<P>

With a course of a few minutes, the talk turned to politics.  It was then that I learned the horrible and sordid truth about this person.  He supports the Social Security, welfare, and unemployment entitlement programs.  He voluntarily redistributes a portion of his income to such non-church entities as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the ACLU, and the Red Cross.  He has no problem with "gay" people.  He supports the rampant federalization of airline security workers, and the general expansion of the United States government.  And he voted for Al Gore (!) in the last presidental election.<P>

Through all this, I smiled and nodded politely, though I could have just as easily leaped across the table and strangled him.  This country has got servicemen in active duty right now, fighting to protect us from the very "values" that he represents ... yet he has the unmitigated gall to spit on the principles that the nation was founded upon, ruining what was otherwise a pleasant dinner.  I looked at my watch, mumbled something about having to get home, and left.  On the way to my car, I kicked a trash can approximately 50 feet, spraining three toes in the process.<P>

As I lay in bed with my wife that evening, I pondered an interesting hypothetical.  Would it have been better if I had skipped the dinner and <I>never had</I> that conversation with this person, and instead gone to work the next day, continuing to believe that he was a decent and moral individual?  I am torn by this.  On the one hand, the little illusions that we cling to can help us get through the day intact.  I have to admit that this stunning revelation is really hurting my productivity.  I'll be busily hacking away on my latest chunk of C code and suddenly something will remind me of this person and I'll become <I>overwhelmed</I> with anger.  I think about Stalin and what he did to all of those millions of people, and it makes me mad.  Then I realize that one of Josef's devotees is sitting three cubicles down from me, and it's all I can do to prevent myself from slamming my fist into my keyboard in rage.  Going outside and smoking a Marlboro seems to be a nice, calming influence .. but in an hour I'm right back outside again, smoking another cigarette.<P>

On the other hand, my rational side tells me that it's better for me to know the truth, no matter how horrible it is.  Even if it completely destroys my productivity and work output, it's better that this is out in the open.  I was lucky; I found out the truth when we were in a fairly isolated social situation.  It could have been worse .. <I>far worse</I>.  What if the truth had come out at the company's summer picnic, an event that my wife and children attend with me?  What if this person had gotten to my family?  I'll be honest with you .. before last night, I would have invited this individual into my home for dinner or drinks without a moment's hesitation.  I shudder to think what might have happened if I had gotten up to use the restroom or answer the phone, leaving my family <I>alone</I> with this monster.<P>

All things being equal, I think it's better than I know the truth.  However, as the Astute Reader will point out, this is all mental hand-wringing anyway; <I>what's done is done</I>, and it's time to deal with it.  Wasting all this time contemplating about how things <I>could</I> have turned out is even less productive than beating the side of your monitor in rage at how Chairman Mao butchered so many of his own people.<P>

In my personal life, where I have a good deal of control over who I allow into my world and who I do not, I don't consort with Communists, and neither should you.  It's a matter of principle.  At work, however, it's a <I>completely</I> different story.  Here, an individual does <I>not</I> have a particularly large amount of control over the people that we see, work, and interact with.  The fact that there is a Communist here is bad enough ... the fact that he works on <I>my freaking team</I> is exponentially worse.<P>

I've got some options.  The first, I suppose, is to try to avoid him to whatever degree possible.  There are many reasons why this will be difficult, not the least of which is that we are both on the same team and a certain amount of interaction is required.  If team communication suffers, then productivity suffers, and that will hurt my company's ability to maximize its wealth-creation potential.  Still, my productivity is suffering enough as it is, and so maybe avoiding him is not a bad call.  If he catches on and starts asking questions, however (and he probably will), then there exists the danger of an altercation that can make things worse off for everybody. If a campaign of avoidance is the answer, it will have to be carefully orchestrated.<P> 

The second option is to report this individual to Human Resources.  HR types are notorious for going to extreme lengths in order to promote a "healthy workplace", and I could contend to them that such a workplace does not include Marxists.  The problem with this is that Human Resources departments typically only care about fabricated leftist issues, such as "sexual harassment."  This being the case, they are more likely to sympathize with my bloodthirsty butcher of a co-worker than they are to take action <I>against</I> him.  They will ask for concrete examples of his workplace misbehavior, and they will be missing the point.  Communists always try to keep things quiet; in the 1950s, it took the combined effort of the United States Congress and the national media to run the Stalinists out of Tinseltown.  This being the case, I find it unlikely that a couple of pencil-pushers in HR are going to help me here. <P>

Another option is to try to convert this individual.  I could "accidentally" leave copies of magazines such as <I>The Weekly Standard</I> and <I>WorldNet</I> laying around the office in conspicuous locations where he is likely to find them.  You never know ... he might pick them up, start reading, and learn the truth about liberals, minorities, etc.  I admit that it is more likely that he will take the magazines out to the parking lot and burn them, but it might be worth a shot.  Perhaps if I were to anonymously slip books and articles by respected people such as William F. Buckley, George Will, and Phyllis Schlafly into his mailbox, he might see the light.  It's a long shot, but the investment is minimal and the payoff is potentially great.  Despite what you may think, I really do want to save this person from his enslavement to the collectivist claptrap that he so desperately clings to.<P>

There is another option I'm considering.  I am in a position to give feedback for this individual's yearly performance review, and the review period is coming up in a couple of months.  Furthermore, as the project leader, my input will carry a lot of weight with our management.  I could easily put together a very negative review which portrays this guy as a complete, bumbling boob.  The conclusion would be that he is nothing but dead weight and an extreme liability for the firm.  Now by all accounts, this guy does excellent work, so there are some real moral and ethical questions that are brought up by this course of action.  However, I have to admit that these concerns quickly evaporate when I think of Elian Gonzalez licking the boots of that bearded freak in Havana.  "Two wrongs don't make a right," the old saying goes, but whoever came up with that saying was not dealing with the likes of Lyndon LaRouche and Ted Kennedy.<P>

My final option is to quit my job.  Ultimately, it's going to have to be either me or him.  If I can't convert him or get him to leave, and if I can't convince the firm that it's poor business policy to have Kruschevists on the staff, then I'll have no choice but to remove myself from the equation and seek employment with somebody who places a higher emphasis on traditional values and American decency.  This would (obviously) be a last resort; I shouldn't have to quit <I>my</I> job and throw my family into financial uncertainty because of the actions of somebody <I>else</I>.  But if decent Americans are not willing to take a principled stand on this, the most important of issues, have we not sold out?  If we turn a blind eye to the menace of Communism, how are we any better than the Communists themselves?<P>

I'm interested to hear input from Adequacy readers.      <br><br></div>

I am not a Libertarian.  My official affiliation is with Howard Phillips and the Constitution Party.  While I admire the basic libertarian principle of limited goverment, the hedonistic free-for-all that libertarianistism calls for would be disastrous.  Any party whose platform calls for the legalization of drugs, prostitution, sodomy, and abortion is <i>not</i> good for America.  Government does have a role in promoting and providing deceny, the sort of decency that the Founding Fathers would want if they were around today.<BR><BR>

If you've ever seen television appearances by Harry Browne (the Libertarian Party's last presidental candidate), you'll know what I mean.  Every time the guy is on TV, his eyes are glazed over, his speech is slurred, and the guy is so obviously stoned that I cannot believe that <i>anybody</i> would throw their support behind such impropriety.  If the LP would throw in a commitment to decent values to go with their small-government crusade, I would back them 100%.<BR><BR>

<i>you can't decide what's good for someone else, which is what you are trying to do.</i><BR><BR>

You have me confused with the Communists.  It is they who believe that everybody must think and behave like them.  If you've seen <i>Star Trek</i>, you're familiar with the scene where Darth Vader tells the Emperor: "He will join us or die, my Master."  This is the Marxist mindset, and all you need to do is look at the history books if you want proof.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

I reiterate my earlier statements of scepticism, and offer the suggestion that all the liberalist propaganda about the founding fathers' cannabinoidal proclivities is nothing but opportunistic revisionist bullshit.

OK, let's just take one little piece of your rant:<BR>
<BR>
"he has the unmitigated gall to spit on the principles that the nation was founded upon"<BR>
<BR>
That's all we need. Everything else was badly written troll. In fact, you're pretty crap at writing these stories aren't you?<BR>
<BR>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the founding principles were supposed to be all about freedom of expression and belief. This guy states a belief, and you decide that he is anti-US. I suggest that it is in fact you, yourself, who is wholly not USian - you are a disgrace to your nation.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are plenty of reasons as to why you have such a strong feeling towards this person, even though those feelings are the reason why the US was founded in the face of the Catholic Church 'locking down' on Europe. It's common knowledge that Communists have larger penises and are better lovers than normal 'capitalist' Americans - perhaps you're jealous? In addition, this guy actually donates money to charities and shows genuine christian spirit - think parable of the Good Samaritan. Perhaps you realise you're not a very good Christian, and here is a man who is almost certainly going to be granted eternal salvation.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, perhaps you've realised that the founding principles are a load of shit - perhaps, just maybe, you want to carry a gun because you want to kill people and for no other reason. Perhaps you have decided that the only sort of free speech you want, is your type of free speech. Perhaps the only people who should have a politcal voice are people like you - then the US becomes even MORE like Europe in the 17th century. Perhaps you want the whole world to revolve around you, and you're not going to stop until it is.<BR>
<BR>
Fantastic. Go for it. I can't wait to see the fallout. I want to be there on the day when you sit down and realise what it is you have become.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So your argument is, essentially, that, in the name of Free Speech, Americans should stand idly by and watch as a person or persons uses a freedom given to them by the Constitution to completely destroy the American way of life and replace it with a regime that would not only restrict free press, but trample over the entire Bill of Rights? This is a typical leftist rant. Of course we want to muzzle the Communists, that may be what prevents us all from becoming a group of godless, unarmed, goose-stepping, wall bulding, collectivist drunkards!<BR><BR>
I also take issue with the fact that you, for no obvious reason, attempt to bring the Second Amendment into your argument. The principles upon which America was founded provide any decent person with the right to bear arms for any reason, even if it is <i>"because you want to kill people and for no other reason"</i>. I myself carry a handgun at all times expressly for the purpose of killing a person if the need arises. As is typical of those who wish to repress the freedoms of others, you seek to first disarm them. Be aware that Americans will fight tooth and nail to defend themselves, whether the threat originates from the mouths of subversive Communists or at the hands of an unscrupulous criminal.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

The key points here are:<BR>

1. This person is not a Communist. In the UK he would be called a Liberal Democrat - in other words, people should be able to live their lives as they wish, and he is in a position to help out those less fortunate than himself<BR>

Did you know that the idea of re-distribution of wealth is entrenched in various religions - christianity, judaism and islam all have traditions in place for people to help those less fortunate than themselves.<BR>
<BR>
You see, the problem here, is that you really believe that YOUR politics are right, and everybody else's are wrong. What you should understand is that debate about politics should be encouraged. If you opened your mind to that, you would agree - communism is not evil, just impractical. It's been tried and tested, and shown not to work due to the inherent greed of man corrupting the system at some level. That doesn't mean that it's going to take over the world. You need to forget about those nasty 1950's propoganda films about 'The Domino Effect' and just accept some people have different ideas about how to live their life than you do.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway... let's see you show how this guy is going to cause the downfall of America.<BR>

I was going to question you on your gun-carrying habit, but realise that if you want to carry a lethal weapon that one day will end up getting you into trouble, that's upto you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Communism is not impractical. I don't know where you get this idea. Commsunism has never been tried out. Seventypercent is raging against deformed workers states, Stalinism, Maoism and the like. These states have nothing in common with communism.<BR><BR>
The big problem for Communism is that it has only been tried once. In Russia in 1917, there were a few years where communism stood a chance, and it performed very well considering. But, Socialism requires an advanced capitalist state to have a revolution in and take to a new level, and backwards Russia did not provide that. It also had 21 armies of foreign agression and the ravages of WWI to deal with. Communism in Russia was always doomed, and turned to stalinism. Unfortunately every other implementation of 'communism' has in fact been a Stalinist dictatorial system. This is because the USSR was seen as a model, and used it's influence to try and destroy Socialism. Every major state has had a power structure that has vehemently tried to destroy communism. Communism was attacked from both sides during the Cold War. What are they so scared of? Cuba is not communist, nor is China, North Korea, or anywhere. These places are blasphemies.<BR><BR>
BTW, France is not remotely Socialist. It is just another capitalist state. What is socialism? Socialism is the common and democratic ownership of the means of production. France may have some despicable left reformist governments from time to time, but it most definitely is <b>not</b> socialist, nomatter what these reformists might say.<BR><BR>
Seventypercent doesn't seem to hate communism at all. He hates dictatorial, deformed, totalitarian states, for sure, but every man of moral values should. He also associates the left reformists with such dictatorial tendencies (the Democrats), and evidence would tend to back him up, left reformist governments such as 'New labour' in the UK and the Liberal Democrats have notably authoritarian, nannyish characteristics.<BR><BR>
Communism has nothing to do with the butchering Stalinists or stupid 'Democrats' (hah!). And nor does socialism.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I have yet to see anyone post an example of real communism NOT working.  Communism is simply a new way of looking at how things might work.  I agree that, in the end, it would be incredibly difficult to set up, but if it were tried, it could solve a whole lot of problems.  Read Walden II for an example of how life could be if everything went perfectly.  There would be an enormous number of changes that would scare the pants off of most staunch conservatives, but the American Revolution did the same thing to all of the "right-thinking" monarchistic Englishmen of the time.  The world was even sure that the American experiment would fail within a few years, but today it is one of the youngest and yet most powerful nations in the world.  Perhaps Communism/Socialism is the next step toward a peaceful society where happiness is maximized and suffering minimized.  You must try it to find out.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Of course you left out the most damning evidence, but regardless, when one considers the aggregate evidence against him the guy is obviously red to the core. Funny that you would mention the UK as it does not matter a whit in the context of this discussion what the UKians would call him. Equally odd that you would try to hold up France as some great example of the wonders of communism, even though you claim it is Socialist (not Communist), and it is actually neither. Regardless, those people haven't accomplished anything of merit in quite a long time.<BR><BR>

Why exactly would any rational person, myself included, really believe that their politics were NOT right? I mean, do you often encounter people who say things like "I'm obviously wrong about this situation but I'll persist in believing what I do despite that." Of course I think my politics are better than yours, and pretty much everyone else's now that I think about it. Thats why I hold to them instead of 'opening my mind', a phrase that you people have twisted into meaning something along the lines of 'just accept everything as OK'. Those 1950s propaganda films are one of the reasons why you are able to post your drivel on this weblog instead of standing on a corner waving the hammer and sicle.<BR><BR>

I'm also confused as to how I could get myself into trouble by carrying a handgun. Logic seems to dictate that it would help me get out of it.

Your plan sucks anyway - damn stupid. You can assume that this communist site logs the posting time like most sites do. And what if your commie friend passes a security camera near that time or has proof he wasnt at his computer at that time? That way they will know he never posted it.<BR>

Communism is insideous.  Simply being exposed to Communist propaganda can turn you into one.  Direct exposure can lead to Communism in a matter of months.  Indirect exposure may take longer, but the result is the same.  I don't expect you are actually reading any Communist literature, but your angry obsession with your Communist co-worker is putting Communism into your head.
<BR><BR>
Yes, you are thinking anti-communist thoughts, but they are still Communist thoughts.  I recommend not thinking about Communism at all.  It takes effort but it's important you do it.  Concentrate very hard:  <i>no</i> thoughts about Communism.   Just put it out of your head completely.  Say to your self over and over, "I will not think about Communism.  I will not think about Communism."  When you hear Communism being discussed near you, say "La! La! La!  I can't hear you!"  Do it!  It works.

One helpful tactic is for the group to engage in loud, good-natured converstion during breaks.  When the communist coworker draws near, the talk should fade into awkward silence, only to pick up again as the fellow-traveller moves away.<BR><BR>Next, encourage your coworkers to decorate the office in patriotic themes.  Seize upon the present groundswell of patriotism to embellish your workplace with flags, red-white-and-blue ribbons, portraits of great Presidents like Washington, Jackson, and Reagan, and posters illustrating patriotic themes.  The experience of having to spend each workday in a proudly pro-USA office will surely shrivel the black soul of your vile Red officemate.<BR><BR>Remember that communists are known to engage in acts of sabotage against decent American industries.  Keeping in mind that extermism in defense of liberty is no vice, you should feel free to rifle through your leftist coworkers' workspace and belongings for evidence that he is attempting to undermine American capitalism from within.<BR><BR>Finally, most communists suffer from syphillitic dementia, and often hide turds in drawers.  Be sure to check any cabinets or desks that your Marxist coworker has been near to be sure they have not secreted away an unpleasant surprise.

Finally, I have an awful truth to admit. I too am a communist. However, I hate social security, welfare and unemployment checks. I do not donate to the communist charities that the author mentions. I have a serious problem with gay people - I could even be one! I hate people who work hard, and I do not want the governmnet to get bigger unlike that commie George Bush. I did not vote for a liberal tree hugging hippie like Gore. Yet I am still a communist and will never be able to shed that awful taint.

<BR><BR>Seventypercent, Seventypercent, we've known you for a long time and it's sad to see you so <i>distrait</i>.  It's perfectly obvious from the clues sprinkled through your hurt, angry rant, that the "communist" you are talking about is <i>not</i> a real, actual, physical person, distinct from yourself.  No, the discerning eye clearly reads that you are describing the struggle <i>within</i> yourself, between the wholesome and comforting yet mindless conformity that you term "American decency" and the irresistible pull of what you secretly know to be the <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm">ghastly facts</a> about the awful capitalists-dominated world you suffer life within:

<BR><BR><i>...On the other hand, my rational side tells me that it's better for me to know the truth, no matter how horrible it is.</i>

<BR><BR>No, it's not some "colleague" you're mad at, hardly that; it's your own self.  For when the struggle within rose up to consciousness, <i>who did you punish</i>?  Your "co-worker"?  (Come to think of it, I doubt that that "co-worker" even exists at all outside your self-exculpatory imagination.)  No, you promptly took it out on the <i>true</i> culprit:

<BR><BR><i>...On the way to my car, I kicked a trash can approximately 50 feet, spraining three toes in the process...</i>

<BR><BR>Look, I know how it is.  It's like you're raised up all your life to believe <i>this</i> and then the cruel unfeeling universe thrusts under your nose the horrible realization that <i>this</i> is a fraud and all your life you've lived a lie and everything is topsy-turvy, upside-down, confused and backwards.  

<BR><BR>I remember a similar case, a fellow I went to high school with.  Hell, everybody could see, like as though he had it tattooed on his forehead, that he was gay down to the marrow of his bones.  But his father was a fundamentalist preacher and his mother was a strict disciplinarian and he was unaware of the message his every subconscious act shouted out; that he was fated from birth to love men, not women.  Poor bastard even got married to a girl, and he tried his very best to make it work out.  But it was not to be.  Well, a few years later he suddenly had an epiphany, where he realized what his "problem" had been all along.  The shame of it, combined with the clashing dissonance in his mind, drove him to the edge of distraction, and even beyond; he attempted suicide, and only the <a href="http://www.fhp.state.fl.us/html/troopmonth/January2001.html">heroic desperate lunge</a> of a policeman, who seized him at the very instant he attempted to leap off the Sunshine Skyway bridge, one hundred and forty feet above the cold, hard water of Tampa Bay...

<BR><BR>You wouldn't imagine a story so sordid and dismal as this I've recited above could possibly have a happy ending, would you, and yet it does!  For the trauma of his nervous breakdown, combined with the healthgiving respite from conscious care induced by the three-weeks-long regimen of megadose phenothiazines at the mental health clinic, brought my old classmate around to the realization: <i>Why fight it, <b>give in</b>!</i>  To make a long story short, he now lives in Gulfport with his boyfriend and for the first time in a long miserable life he is relaxed, content, at peace with himself and this imperfect world.  And if his aged Daddy has disinherited him of his share of the Ministry's millions, and his Mom cruelly claims he has broken her heart, is that too great a price to have paid?

<BR><BR>Now dammitall 70%, let's compare the gravamina here.  In his case we're talking about <i>sex</i>, the very <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/~mfiebert/freud.htm">foundation</a> of a man's personality.  And you are whining about a mere political allegiance.  As though <i>that</i> amounts to anything, anyway.  If my old classmate can weather so traumatic a revolution in his lifestyle, certainly you can manage a quick cheap jump from one political position to another, diametrically opposed.  Piece of cake.  Why, much <a href="http://www.salon.com/directory/topics/david_horowitz/index.html">more celebrated</a> men than you have exhibited far more acrobatic political transformations, in public too.

<BR><BR>Take the leap, 70%!  Come to the left side and allow your inner struggle to evaporate.  Start <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852-18b/index.htm">here</a>.  After the vast <a href="=www.msnbc.com/">ghastly</a> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">steaming</a> <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/">swamp</a> of intellectual swill you are no doubt accustomed to imbibing daily via the inexorable idiot box, <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852-18b/index.htm">18th Brumaire</a> will make your mind feel like a first bath in a month followed by a professional massage.

There is nothing scientific about his method; in fact, if he tried to pull his stunts today, he would be run out of town as a cheating quack, and possibly incriminated with charges of sexual abuse. 
<BR><BR>
But of course, if you are even the lest bit familiar with psychoanalysis, you already know all this. I'm just repeating widely-known facts for those poor people who chant Freud's name like a mantra, without actually trying to find out what he stands for.

You stated that you were offended at people who did not know the difference between freud and jung (being a classical man yourself, and classical men always know the difference) and that, furthermore, freud was a member of NAMBLA, a drug user and that, of-course, makes psychoanalysis a fraud.<BR>
<BR>
I completely agree with all seven of your points. However I would like to add that the conclusion that psychoanalysis is a fraud, does not necessarily follow from freud being a fraud.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the people with grand theories were frauds. If one were allowed to dismiss their work based merely on personal incompetence - then one would have very little theories to argue about.<BR>
<BR>
Take for example physics - Most physicists are liars and thieves and frauds. However, is physics a fraud?<BR>
Well, yes it is, but no because of the ingrate nature of the practicioner.<BR>
<BR>
One of the biggest liberal myths is that progress in physics is made by physicists and that only physicists are allowed to make that progress.<BR>

I have even heard one of them say "We aren't in the business of making money -- we're in the business of spending it."  Yes, it is a dangerous game they play.
<BR><BR>So, my workplace has been quite a nightmare.  I am in a quandary, as there seem to be Communists everywhere.  On the other hand, the federal government has pretty good job security, so maybe I'll stay.<BR><BR><BR><i>It's all right to cry,<br>

How can you argue with 100% employment and no starvation? Unless you are a greedy capitalist with no morals you cannot.

What is a decent person to do when you find out that you are working with a Communist?<BR>
<BR>
That's just as bad as asking what you should do if you find out there's a *gasp* black person working in the organisation.<BR>
<BR>
Well, between the two of you, I'd let the so-called "communist" eat dinner with my family long before I'd let you in the door.  You really have some scary ideas in your head there.  I could advise you to learn some balance, try to appreciate different points of view, or to try many other things.  I'll keep it to a simple concept for you, though - lighten up!<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">What is it about Communism that so frightens America?  Although I'm not a full communist (the principles of communism rely on non-existant human attributes--namely kindness, selflessness and generosity), I consider myself a social liberal.  I wonder, does the work of Karl Marx (not the distortion of it that was communist Russia) ever get taught in even the post-secondary level of education?  My history teacher in high school told us that American schools won't even teach Marx's Dialectic Essay form, even though it has nothing whatsoever to do with the "Red Threat."<BR>
<BR>
I wonder.<BR>
<BR>
Let me do &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; spin on Communism.  Communism is the closest thing to what Jesus Christ preached.  Communism redistributes the wealth from those who have everything to those who have nothing.  Communist governments provide food and housing for everyone out of the collective pool of wealth.  Simple principles, really: place the value of the whole over the value of the individual.  It's a nice picture of Utopia, where everyone helps everyone else out, no one goes hungry, and no one sleeps in a cardboard box with a half-empty bottle of potato Vodka to keep them warm.<BR>
<BR>
Like all Utopias, Communism, as an ideology (note the root of this word is &lt;i&gt;ideal&lt;/i&gt;) doesn't work.  Not because the idea is bad, but because the people are bad.  Human beings are by nature selfish, greedy, and fiercely competitive.  It's how we wound up running the food chain.  Communism would require a truly innovative reward system to work: one that encourages competition without creating a power dynamic (or hierarchy).<BR>
<BR>
Another problem is that the nature dominant economy has changed since Marx published.  We don't live in a labour-dependent society anymore--the best-paying jobs all depend on learned skills, be they social or technical.  Communism is founded on the union and the labourer.  It's become a relic.<BR>
<BR>
That doesn't mean, however, that it has no merits, and that it shouldn't be taught as an alternate philosophy.  God knows that the presence of something (anything!) other than capitalist imperialism could only do western culture a favour.  Because the world can't support consummerist behaviour forever.  Because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; getting warmer, the weather is changing, there's artifial shit blowing around on the ground, the air stinks and I still have to go through three layers of packaging (two of them non-biodegradeable plastic) to get at my food, which itself is processed and preserved until it's three chemical combinations away from being plastic.<BR>
<BR>
So where does that leave Communism?  Or environmentalism, for that matter?  What do we do with them?<BR>
<BR>
I say people need to get over their fear of the unknown.  Get your nose in a book and learn what Communism was &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to be before Lenin and Stalin got to it.  Then, when you're done, think about it and decide if any of it would benefit your personal paradigm.  And, if so, cut and paste the good (and realistic) parts of the ideology into your own.  There's more to politics and ideology than Republican and Democrat, Liberal and Conservative.  The world does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; start at the western edge of the Pacific Ocean and end at the eastern side of the Atlantic.  September 11th made one thing clear.  Nobody exists in a vaccuum, and what happens on the other side of the planet sure as hell can effect what happens in your back yard.<BR>
