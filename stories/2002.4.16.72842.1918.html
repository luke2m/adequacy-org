		All around us we can see the decay of our society. It is evident in the
crime-ridden, drug-infested culture that is beamed into our homes on a
daily basis from <a href="http://www.cnn.com">dumbed down news agencies</a>. Our businesses are <a href="http://www.fool.com">less
efficient</a>, mental illness is <a href="http://news.theolympian.com/health/10261123/131765.shtml">on the rise within the West within children</a>, and increasingly
<a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">junk food</a> is accepted as a quick stand-in for a <a href="http://www.burgerking.com/">square meal</a>. I have spent
the last few months thinking about what has caused this and how we can
stop the decline of society. Clearly there must be something that we are
exposed to early in our lives which causes such dementia, and what I
found was disturbing. I discovered the true meaning of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com:80/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439146712/adequacy-20">nursery rhymes</a>
being told to children all over the world tonight as they are being tucked

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Nursery rhymes lead children to making stupid, rash, ill-thought out decisions that ultimately lead to lives of sexual promiscuity, broken
marriages, drug-infestation and general unhappiness. In short, nursery rhymes are pivotal to our society unwittingly leading the future generations - our children - into a disaster zone.<br><br>

You may think that I am over-reacting - surely those little ditties that are sung to our little loved ones as they lay their heads to sleep are completely innocent, and many of you will contend that I am trying to be overly politically correct, however I really think I need to show to you just how dangerous some of these rhymes are. Below, I present a group of popular nursery rhymes followed by my reasonable understanding of their true meanings. You can then decide for yourselves whether we should continue to allow our children to be subjected to their filth - this is no <a href="http://www.snopes2.com/radiotv/tv/pugwash.htm">urban myth a la "Roger the Cabin Boy" from Captain Pugwash</a>; this is real.<br><br>
<i>
Jack and Jill<br>
Went up the hill<br>
To fetch a pail of water.<br>
Jack fell down<br>
And broke his crown<br>
And Jill came tumbling after.<br>
<br></i>
We begin with promiscuity - young men and women being allowed to go around unaccompanied. There is no mention as to whether Jack and Jill are courting, but I suspect that this sort of immoral behaviour (young couples disappearing off without parental consent) is common in many <a href="http://www.open.gov.uk/">communist dictatorships</a>. There is also an implication of child labour - why were they going to fetch the water? No doubt Jill's pimp and Jack's crack dealer was forcing them into the deal. The evidence to support this is quite clearly how unsober Jack was to 'fall down' and 'break his crown' (the crown refers to his head and not a majestic/golden adornment for our American cousins). He was either clearly drunk, or smoking some sort of 'waccy-baccy'. Jill also seemed equally 'sloshed'<br><br>
<i>
Up Jack got<br>
And home did trot<br>
As fast as he could caper<br>
Went to bed<br>
And plastered his head<br>
With vinegar and brown paper<br>
<br></i>
You may notice there is no concern for Jill's welfare here - she is left at the bottom of the hill to rot. Perhaps Jack was so drunk that he forgot Jill was with him. He certainly must have been rather out of it to start plastering his head with vinegar and brown paper - perhaps this rhyme is supposed to prepare the children of the UK for the decline in the NHS and make it acceptable for poor healthcare to be doled out on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/mandelson/0,7368,427434,00.html">poor</a>, the <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=483">drunk</a> and the <a href="http://www.fco.gov.uk/directory/dynpage.asp?Page=516">addicts</a>.<br><br>

The next rhyme I noticed had other meaning as well as just being ill-advised was the 'Owl and the Pussycat',
a popular nursery rhyme supposedly detailing the wondrous love of an Owl
and a Cat. The first verse goes thus:<br><br>
<i>
The Owl and the Pussy-cat went to sea<br>
In a beautiful pea green boat,<br>
They took some honey, and plenty of money,<br>
Wrapped up in a five pound note.<br>
The Owl looked up to the stars above,<br>
And sang to a small guitar,<br>
'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love,<br>
What a beautiful Pussy you are,<br>
You are,<br>
You are!<br>
What a beautiful Pussy you are!'<br>
</i><br>
Straight away we see several problems. In this day where humans of all creeds, class and colours 'get it on' we may accept a social tolerance to many types of relationship. However, are we really supposed to expect inter-species breeding is a good thing? The net is awash with <a href="http://www.goatse.cx">bestiality</a>. Infesting our children's minds with this sort of muck is not going to reverse the situation.<br><br> 
Secondly, the whole idea has clearly not been thought out properly - going to sea is a dangerous
activity at the best of times. Suggesting that going in a small boat with
nothing more than some 'honey and plenty of money wrapped up in a five pound note' is dangerous. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_810000/810253.stm">Young sailors</a> should be made aware that more
provisions should be taken aboard a boat and that customs and excise should be informed if you enter a new country. If you turn up as the owl
and pussycat do, you are almost certainly going to be arrested on
suspicion of drug smuggling - perhaps the underlying story here is that the CIA want the profession of smuggling to be seen as 'romantic' so they can encourage youngsters to move cocaine out of Columbia. It still remains dangerous however when conducted in this manner - I dread to think what would
happen if a storm broke out as there is no mention of life jackets being
taken aboard on this voyage. Lastly, the vulgarity and sexual
innuendo of the owls references to 'pussy' is disgusting, and not worthy
of any captain of any vessel. It gets worse though, as the second verse
shows:<br><br>
<i>
Pussy said to the Owl, 'You elegant fowl!<br>
How charmingly sweet you sing!<br>
O let us be married! too long we have tarried:<br>
But what shall we do for a ring?'<br>
They sailed away, for a year and a day,<br>
To the land where the Bong-tree grows<br>
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood<br>
With a ring at the end of his nose,<br>
His nose,<br>
His nose,<br>
With a ring at the end of his nose.<br>
</i><br>
OK, so the cat is a slut who will get married to any old thing - even a
suspect drug dealer who isn't even of the same species. This is dangerous
stuff. What is worse is the drug reference - the Bong Tree - and a pig who
has defaced himself with a body piercing. Something that is all too common
in our <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/">modern society with its loose morals</a>. For reasons of space, I will
not repeat the last verse here, suffice to say they use the pig's ring as
the sacred token of marriage (quite disgusting, and obviously
anti-Semitic). They also dance by the light of the moon - a reference I
believe to drug and rave culture where young people dance late into the
night. If you can't see the dangers here, you're <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/">an idiot</a>.<br><br>

Next though, I discovered other nursery rhymes that lead young misguided
parents into giving their young children awful lessons in life. For
example:<br><br>
<i>
Humpty Dumpty sat on a Wall,<br>
Humpty Dumpty had a great Fall,<br>
All the King's Horses,<br>
All the King's Men,<br>
Couldn't Put Humpty Together Again<br>
</i><br>
This is not only anti-Royalist and a disgraceful slur on Monarchy, but
shows how dangerous risk-taking activities are. Why did Humpty Dumpty
fall? I suspect the hidden message is that Humpty was a crack smoker and
was <a href="http://www.highonlife.org/">'high on life'</a> - the fact that his end was so pathetic may not get
through to some kids. In this day and age where so many wish to be famous,
the fact that this buffoon has been granted infamy through his dangerous
acts may make some wish to follow him. However, the worst Nursery Rhyme
yet that I have encountered is that of Old Mother Hubbard:<br><br>
<i>
Old Mother Hubbard<br>
Went to the cupboard<br>
To fetch her poor dog a bone;<br>
But when she came there<br>
The cupboard was bare,<br>
And so the poor dog had none.<br>
</i><br>
This is animal neglect, and poor house management. Young women should be
taught that to allow their homes to fall into such a state is a disgrace.
To not even have enough food for the dog is something worthy of prison.
However, the story goes on:<br><br>
<i>
She took a clean dish<br>
To get him some tripe;<br>
But when she came back<br>
He was smoking a pipe.<br>
She went to the grocer's<br>
To buy him some fruit;<br>
But when she came back<br>
He was playing the flute.<br>
</i><br>
The dog, quite clearly, is taking drugs. The 'pipe' is either a bong or a
crack pipe. A short time later the poor animal is so off its tits it's
playing a flute - this is a story of real-life ghetto and social welfare
existence and is happening all over our country right now today. What this
story has to answer for is shocking. The story however, has no happy
ending, merely a warning to the children who wish to follow the dog's
example:<br><br>
<i>
She went to the baker's<br>
To buy him some bread;<br>
But when she came back<br>
The poor dog was dead.<br>
</i><br>
A sad tale. Quite clearly, the dog had over-dosed. So easy to do when you
have paws, and not opposable thumbs like us superior human beings, having
been blessed by God.<br><br>
<i>
She went to the undertaker's<br>
To buy him a coffin;<br>
But when she came back<br>
The poor dog was laughing.<br>
</i><br>
Ahhh, a sick joke, no doubt April Fool's or some other satanic ritual. I
suspect that the dog at this stage may actually be undead, as he most
likely practised Wicca or Satanism.<br><br>
<i>
She went to the hatter's<br>
To buy him a hat;<br>
But when she came back<br>
He was feeding the cat.<br>
<br>
The dame made a curtsey,<br>
The dog made a bow;<br>
The dame said, "Your servant."<br>
The dog said, "Bow wow!"<br>
</i><br><br>
If this story isn't about the subservience to the Devil himself, I don't
know what other purpose it could serve. It is a disgrace that such devil
worship should be permitted into the minds of our children. I would like
to suggest that we write to our politicians now to have such disgraceful
'ditties' outlawed and protect our children. There are many other nursery
rhymes that show ill judgement and should not be given to young minds. If
other readers wish to make suggestions, I would be grateful however I now
wish to make some short comments about other rhymes I have discovered that
are in the height of bad taste and clearly suggest a life of immortality to
our children:<br><br>
<i>
Baa, baa, black sheep,<br>
Have you any wool?<br>
Yes sir, yes sir,<br>
Three bags full;<br>
One for the master,<br>
And one for the dame,<br>
And one for the little boy<br>
Who lives down the lane.<br>
</i><br>
A racist term on the first line, and then a sheep that is quite obviously
paying off bribes to the local Mafioso, a prostitute and his rent boy.
Also shows poor judgement with regard to the sheep understanding
production cycles and market economics.<br><br>
<i>
Hickory, dickory, dock,<br>
The mouse ran up the clock.<br>
The clock struck one,<br>
The mouse ran down!<br>
Hickory, dickory, dock.<br>
</i><br>
Cowardice. Pure and simple cowardice.<br><br>
<i>
Dance to your Daddy,<br>
My little babby,<br>
Dance to your Daddy,<br>
My little lamb.<br>
You shall have a fishy<br>
In a little dishy,<br>
You shall have a fishy<br>
When the boat comes in.<br>
</i><br>
Quite obviously paedophilic prostitution - who allowed this into the
public domain as being acceptable? I have even found new nursery rhymes in
the course of my research (like the one <a href="http://www.zelo.com/family/nursery/dutchgirl.htm">here</a> that are
beyond even innuendo. Write to your politicians NOW! Stop this
filth!<br><br>

Once there was a piece of chocolate in the shape of a cock. The chocolate cock stood right in the very middle of a sweet-shop window, and all the children came to look at him. He was very proud of himself indeed.<br><br>
"I am the Chocolate Cock!" he crowed. "I am the Chocolate Cock! I am the handsomest bird in the world, for I am the Chocolate Cock!"<br><br>
He was marked a shilling, and none of the children that came to look at the cock could afford to buy him. They just stood and looked at him.<br><br><i>(From "The Talking Teapot and Other Tales" by Enid Blyton [London, 1938]. Spotter: Michael Moon)</i>

A chocolate rooster is a rooster made out of chocolate, a (sometimes) impressive "piece of art" and therefore standing in a window (and feeling proud of himself). I don't get what could in this case hurt children, unless of course it is misinterpreted but I doubt that was the intent when it was first made up.
<BR><BR>
I could be misinterpreting your post, and if I'm doing just that feel free to tell me.

<BR><BR>
The following is a transcript of exactly what the dictionary says:

<BR><BR>
def. 1:
1. (used alone) male bird of the domestic or farmyard fowl.
2. bird: <i>pea~</i>; <i>~-sparrow</i>; <i>~-robin</i>. <i><b>~a-doodle-doo</b></i> n. the crow of the ~(def. 1); child's name for ~ (def. 1). <i><b>~-and-bull-story,</b></i> foolish story that no one should believe. <i><b>~-crow n</b></i>. dawn; daybreak. <i><b>~-fighting</b></i> n. fighting by game-~s (see game, def. 6) as a sport for onlookers. <i><b>live like fighting ~s</b></i>, live on the best possible food. <i><b>~ of the walk (school)</b></i>, person who dominates others.

<BR><BR>
def. 2:
1. tap and spout for controlling the flow of a liquid or a gas (from a pipe, barrel, etc.)
2. lever in a gun; position of this lever when it is raised and ready to be released by the trigger: <i>at half (full)</i> ~, half ready (quite ready) to be fired.

<BR><BR>
def. 3:
(VP 1, 10 with up)
1. turn upwards, cause to be erect (showing attention, inquiry, defiance, etc.): <i>The horse ~ed its ears. The horse stopped with its ears ~ed up. He ~ed his eye at me</i>, glanced or winked at me knowingly, or raised his eyebrow. <i>~ed <b>hat</b></i> n. triangular hat, pointed front and back, worn with some uniforms. <b><i>knock, (sb. or sth.) into a ~ed hat</i></b>, knock shapeless, or so that recognition is impossible; beat thoroughly.
2. raise the cock of (a gun) (see cock def. 2) ready for firing.

<BR><BR>
def. 4:
small, cone-shaped pile of hay. <b><i>v.t.</i></b>pile (hay) in ~s.

In the little miss muffet rhyme, you quite rightly call attention to the dog's pipe smoking.  However, later in that verse is a reference to "playing the flute," which clearly means "playing the skin-flute," or, to be crass about it, "giving a virtuoso blow-job."  This sort of filth is especially worrisome to parents who also have dogs.  Children should not be led to believe that starving an animal will earn you sexual favors from the desperate animal, as this will only lead to confusion later in life.<BR>

This is so sad, a supposed adult twisting words around to create a sexual meaning out of everything. The way I see it Nathan, you have a disturbing obsession with sex to find so many vague meanings. I think you are the one who needs therapy to help you get your mind out of the gutter before you become some kind of sick sexual prowler. Do your self and the rest of the world a favor and take a step back and look at your posts. Then see how sad of a person you really are. Turn off your computer and get a life after getting help. Please don't bother picking about my word choice and getting some sort of perverse pleaser out of since I don't have the time to sit here with a dictionary to find the perfect words to satisfy your anal nature.

If he is so worried about the decay of our country, he should look no further than the gambling his name is obviously propagating. I suggest a change in your screen name for all the children who didn't grow up quite yet who visit this site, albeit illegally. (This is a site for grown-ups).<BR>
<BR>
Next, I believe that these nursery rhymes are perfectly resonable, and actually promote the learning of our little ones. For instance, they learn to rhyme well, which has math connections in that carefully measured meter leads to many mathematical patterns. <BR>
<BR>
For one to respond this subject of nursery rhymes this vehemently, I must suggest the possibility of a traumatic experience as a young child, such as molestation, has occured to DiceMan. Another example of the child trauma would be the perverted and drug-related comments in his article. He must have turned to drugs as consolation for this traumatic experience, and the molestation is an obvious link to his current perverted twist on harmless nursery rhymes.<BR>
<BR>
I say that you conservatives need lighten up and realize that we liberals need to have fun too, and that drugs aren't the only way we do it.<BR>
This is your last warning:<BR>
LAY OFF OUR NURSERY RHYMES!!!!<BR>
<BR>
Step One: Read my screen name.<BR>
Step Two: Act upon what you just read.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I also happen to make quite a bit of cash out of it.

<BR>
Your argument around rhymes improving mathematics, is I am afraid, poppy-cock. The only way to get a child to learn maths quickly is through good use of the cane or belt. Your liberal attitudes suggest that you obviously hug trees and think that 'home-schooling' is a great idea. I pity your children for the filth you no doubt subject them to every day by forcing nursery rhymes down their necks at every oppurtunity. And why shouldn't they visit this site? They have to learn what sex is all about sometime, and this form of natural exploration is far safer than the enforced boy-sex-brothels you would probably endorse - you're so conservative, you're probably a facist or something.<BR>
<BR>
As for your comments about my childhood. I am afraid that once more you are mistaken. I was never molested as a child - I actually was the one who suggested the sex with my parents and sister. No trauma involved there. Also, I don't do drugs either - well, OK maybe a bit of smack, a bit of weed, some speed, some coke, all in moderation of course. But doesn't *everybody* these days?<BR>
<BR>
Your conflicting attitudes show you are obviously disillusioned. I pity you. I also suggest you read Luke Rhinehart's book to provide a structure to your schizophrenic behaviour.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As for Humpty Dumpty's actions - well, the dice didn't tell him to do it. Therefore he's just a moron, taking high risks and then the rhyme berates the King's Army for being incompetent.

On the other hand, (here comes the science bit)maybe these rhymes are just there to get kids into language, so they can play with it, & have fun with it. Good old Dr Seuss's books didn't make a great deal of sense half the time, apart from The Sneeches, but kids love em!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nursery rhymes are for young children (0-3 years old maybe a little older), how many children that old understand that pussy is a cat, let alone anything else!  The only people these rhymes may subvert (if they do that at all) are people that are older enough to understand the double meaning behind some words, i.e. teenagers and adults.  Who are already set in their ways and don't really give a shit about nursery rhymes anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Does it occur to anyone that it is not the nursery rhymes that are trying to subvert children, but the pathetic influence today's parents have over there children.  If you have children and they are falling for such tripe (which I sincerely doubt) then I say it reflect more on you being a terrible parent and not bringing your child up correctly, then it does on the child.<BR>
<BR>
A child is a sponge for many years, what they soaks up in experience depends very largely on their parents.<BR>
<BR>
So for god sake stop looking around finding something to blame (I'm mean, nursery rhymes for pity's sake!) and start accepting the fact that if your child turns out bad, you as a parent are in a large part responsible.  Accept it, cope with it and do something about it instead of blaming it on society (which is merely a by product of our own actions, so therefore still our own fault anyway) or nursery rhymes, or this or that.<BR>
<BR>
Simple Equation for those that don't get it.<BR>
1) How a child acts in life depends largely on their early childhood upbringing.<BR>
2) During a child's early childhood up bringing their greatest influence are their parents.<BR>
3) Put 1 and 2 together and STOP PASSING THE BLAME for you own poor parenting ability.<BR>

<br>
You may find Diceman's idea to be far-fetched, but I for one think he has some valid points.  It's a known <a href="http://dbr.df-network.com/forum/viewtopic.php?topic=148&forum=2&91">fact</a> that there are <a href="http://www.mother.com/~prdesign/RubADub.html">hidden</a>, sometimes subliminal <a href="http://www.mother.com/~prdesign/HeyDid.html">messages</a> in our fairy tales and nursery rhymes.  <br>
<br>
If you allowed yourself to be more open-minded, you would realize that removing these <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/3041/diddle.html">twisted</a>, seemingly innocent <a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Tower/4423/mgpmlist.html">rhymes</a> from schools and homes is not such a bad idea, after all.<br>

My point is that no subliminal message is going to work unless the recipient understands the concept of the message in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
I.e. a subliminal message telling me to go jump off the Golden Gate bridge is useless if I have never heard of the Golden gate bridge (I know subliminal messages aren't used like that, but it gets the idea across).<BR>
<BR>
Which gets back to my original point of if you bring your child up properly then these messages will have little effect.  It is the parents responsibility for the child, not society.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This is not only anti-Royalist and a disgraceful slur on Monarchy, but shows how dangerous risk-taking activities are. Why did Humpty Dumpty fall? I suspect the hidden message is that Humpty was a crack smoker and was 'high on life' - the fact that his end was so pathetic may not get through to some kids. In this day and age where so many wish to be famous, the fact that this buffoon has been granted infamy through his dangerous acts may make some wish to follow him."<BR>
--------------<BR>
I'd just like to point out that this is supposed to be a metaphor for a British monarch (who's name eludes me), to imply that his downfall was iminent, or something to that extent.  It's not techically Anti-Royalist, more like anti-pissy-ass king.  And are you saying that this one smoked crack?  I wonder..<BR><BR></FONT></td>
