		Kuro5hin.org, reeling from a crippling loss of talent to the dark forces of Adequacy.org struck back with a vengance today, with this <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/22/91947/1305">thermonuclear troll/satire/I-don't-know-what-to-call-it</a> article.  The man in charge of  planning the counterstrike against Adequacy's campaign of burlesquing the pernicious arguments of the web's blowhards, David Duke, explained the strategy this way:   "We knew that intelligence and reason were not realistic options for us.  The best thing to to when some smart-alec is lampooing you is to out-lampoon the lampooner.  Go so far off the deep end that their caricature of you looks like a compliment!"
<p>
Stunned by this curveball, the mood at Adequacy.org headquartes can only be described as shell shocked.  Said Adequacy editor osm, "I dunno.  Maybe we should just give it up and do some sort of high-concept thing like <i>This American Life</i>, or... or... appeal to the people maybe.  Sure!  We could be the world wide web's answer to <i>Rosie</i> or <i>Oprah</i>!" 
<p>
Streetfighter John Saul Montoya seemed to be taking the opposite approach, brandishing a motorcycle chain and switchblade, "I knew it would come to this.  Been looking forward to it, as a matter of fact.  There's only one way to deal with people like this you know."

Show me one of those explanations. Show me one argument opposing the WTO, G8, etc. that explains the protest movement <b>without</b> resorting to

How about, for a change, pointing out specific instances of irresponsbile corporate behavior; detailing the harmful effects (verifiably) of that behavior; offering realistic, effective methods to counteract this behavior; and then putting those suggestions into practice? And maybe, just for shits and grins, the protesters could every so once in awhile make pretend like there really isn't a massive, big-business controlled global conspiracy that operates in cahoots with aliens and the Illuminati.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>ecological destruction
</i>
<BR><BR>
How much arable land must be destroyed by the grazing habits of McCows before SUV owners say enough is enough? The economic agenda is dictated by people with vested interests in controlling consumer habits toward expensive, non-renewable products which adversely affect people downstream of the original consumptive choice. Is this what it means to be an economy, then? When someone like Bush turns around and sells out on every election commitment, do not then gainsay people's sense of betrayal by asking for a summation of the  facts. Bush was committed to the same set of facts, so what happened? Who bent his ear? What makes temporary sacrifices for future viability impossible? Not voters, surely.
<BR><BR>
<i>economic enslavement</i>
<BR><BR>
The fewer choices you have, the greater your enslavement. World trade organizations and mega corporate conglomerates do not give people real choices for the way they should apply their productive forces. Either Mexico approves this or that treaty -- which by some righteous force of synchronicity consistently  favor corporate conglomerates -- or they are invited to not develop their economies. 
The choices in these trade agreements beg their own questions. 
<BR><BR>
What if we want to pose a different set of questions?
<BR><BR>
You have to impose such institutions of extreme capitalism  because left to their own devices, people will act as they do on the unregulated internet -- ignore any so called natural and voluntary desire to reward commercialization.
<BR><BR>
<i>How about, for a change, pointing out specific instances of irresponsbile corporate behavior;</i>
<BR><BR>
How about, for a change, recognizing dissatisfaction and a willingness to step outside the institutional rules of engagement imposed purely to protect against change? You are an editor of a site which routinely posts stories meant to undermine the implications of arbitrary social values promulgated as Truth.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So I am supposed to blindly accept that the riots are justified based solely on the fact that there are lots of people rioting. Then I am supposed to invent a reason that I find palatable for me to join in the riots. Whether my reasons are complimentary to the reasons of the other rioters is irrelevant as long as I participate.
<BR><BR>
<i>How much arable land must be destroyed by the grazing habits of McCows before SUV owners say enough is enough? </i>
<BR><BR>
Yes, the McCows. The same ones that also deforested the Amazon basin, no doubt. The fact that McDonalds has nothing to do with what you are talking about doesn't matter though. It is perfectly ok to make a large corporate entity the enemy even if they have nothing to do with what you are fighting against. The end always justifies the means. And don't forget to drag the SUV owners into it, too. Two convenient scapegoats for the price of one!
<BR><BR>
<i>Bush turns around and sells out on every election commitment</i>
<BR><BR>
If you find this unusual or surprising then you are a piss-poor history student. That doesn't make it right, but it would be nice to see people stop acting like the US Presidency has all of a sudden been invaded by the anti-Christ.
<BR><BR>
<i>Who bent his ear? [...] Not voters, surely.</i>
<BR><BR>
Who niavely believed that the son of a former president with close ties to the oil and gas industries would follow any sort of environmentally positive agenda? Again, not the voters. They knew, for the most part, what was going to happen. His ear was already bent and everyone knew it. Bush hasn't betrayed anybody except a handful of extremely gullible fools.
<BR><BR>
<i>You have to impose such institutions of extreme capitalism because left to their own devices, people will act as they do on the unregulated internet -- ignore any so called natural and voluntary desire to reward commercialization.</i>
<BR><BR>
I like your Internet. Where can I find it? My Internet is full of people willingly paying for porn, people sending their co-workers "funny" email, and spammers clogging everyone's inbox with advertisements that, believe it or not, often work. The existance of my Internet can be verified with ample statistical evidence, while yours seems to be little more than wishful thinking.
<BR><BR>
<i>How about, for a change, recognizing dissatisfaction and a willingness to step outside the institutional rules of engagement imposed purely to protect against change?</i>
<BR><BR>
That is the only thing I recognize in the rioting - that a small fraction of people are extremely dissatisfied with their world to the point that they are protesting, and in the case of a much smaller fraction, rioting. People feel a unique pathos that is only possible when all their material needs have been satisfied and they can not find any noble purpose in their life. This puts them in the position where they are open to any sort of relief that is offered. Some turn to religion, some to their families, and some decide to rage against the entire world that they have decided is responsible for the icky angst they feel.
<BR><BR>
And now that you think I am the embodiment of evil, let me say that I think it is absolutely wonderful that so many people are so bored and dissatisfied with the state of the world that they are reacting so strongly and in such large numbers. But I think they are reacting stupidly. The hippies of the 60's screamed, yelled, and protested against the wrong things and in the wrong ways. As a result they had very little effect on the world. The anti-globalization protesters are doing the same thing. Rather than accepting that much of how society works is good, they see a few wrongs as justification for a total overthrow of our entire world.
<BR><BR>
Read the history books. Especially the parts with plithy quotes about those who are doomed to repeat things. You might be shocked to discover that screaming and yelling is most often not the most effective way to bring about change.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No, just the usual. People arent evil, people are broken dreams carried away by streams of inertial and revolutionary forces we will read about in tomorrow's history books. 
<BR><BR>
<i>Read the history books.</i>
<BR><BR>
I'll do that. Do you have a recommended reading list which skips over the violent bits? "Then, some stuff happened, and the world changed."

<i>I think it is absolutely wonderful that so many people are so bored and dissatisfied with the state of the world that they are reacting so strongly and in such large numbers.</i>
<BR><BR>
So there is a point behind their irrational behavior, after all.
<BR><BR>
<i>
 But I think they are reacting stupidly.
</i>
<BR><BR>
I tried to make both the lowly protesters and the elite global traders listen to me. Why should they listen to you? 
<BR><BR>
You are wrong about the effectiveness protesters. If you were right, the occasion to defend yourself in this thread would never have arisen. Do you defend the sad state of investigative journalism by justifying the ease and cost effectiveness in reciting news manufactured at government source? On CNN, yesterday, they scrolled a message by a State Dept press flunkie who wished to inform the world that Bush regretted the death of a protester. (Bush is a busy man, presumably, who stays up nights writing his own speeches.)
What do these protesters have to do in order to get CNN to interview <i>them</i>, in fucking person? Are reporters terrified of stumbling into a nest of terrorists? Is that why none of them seem to be lifting an investigative muscle?
<BR><BR>
Well, the protesters are a quick study. Manufacturing news, staging circuses -- what is the qualitative difference? 
<BR><BR>
I do *not* want you or self satisfied kurobots (not to accuse you of such membership) to put on red noses and slip into bowling shoes, for that would undermine the effectivess and legitimacy of protest. I want people to demonstrate moral outrage over undefended innocent property. I want people to defend jeeps running over dead protesters. I want people to articulate their reactionary reasoning because, paradoxically, their eloquent articulation is more effective than anything the protesters can say for themselves.
<BR><BR>
If you were a betting man, what would you wager that the next protest will be the biggest yeat?
<BR><BR>
<i>Rather than accepting that much of how society works is good</i>
<BR><BR>
Few people need to argue the mechanism of how things work (I do) in order to dispute who and what it should end up working for. This is all about a loss of control over one's fate. If you think otherwise, then you should quote from the text of trade treaties written and read in secrecy. 
 We've been spolied by democracy and resent being lectured on peace by Machiavellians whose secretly negotiated peace we do not want; a world of peaceful corporations is not good enough. I'm uninterested in peacefully agreeing to buy what is offered for sale, I want to change the nature of the goods sold.

<BR><BR>
<i>Do you have a recommended reading list which skips over the violent bits? </i>
<BR><BR>
Sure. Any history book that focuses on human innovation instead of wars would do just fine. Henry Ford has influenced USian society exponentially more than Hitler, Trotsky and Napolean combined. And not in a good way either, IMO.
<BR><BR>
<i>So there is a point behind their irrational behavior, after all. </i>
<BR><BR>
There was a point made in Seattle. Very clear and powerful. Two years later and that point has been lost because it was never followed up with anything worthwhile. Just more of the same "we're pissed of and we are going to break things" idiocy.
<BR><BR>
<i>What do these protesters have to do in order to get CNN to interview them, in fucking person? </i>
<BR><BR>
Be more clear in their goals. Explain things in terms that even the most clueless, selfish person can understand. Organize in a more effective way than just provoking anarchists via mail lists. Stop believing that some inherent goodness in humanity is enough to sway the general population. Infiltrate organizations. Sieze power. Take control. Subvert from within rather than try to force change from the outside. Employ the media as a tool for propaganda, including all the negative aspects that word conveys. Get your hands dirty, because that's how battles are won or lost. You can't clean the outhouse if you are afraid of getting a little shit on you. Would Thoreau have had anywhere near the impact he did if Emerson had not been there to promote his writings?
<BR><BR>
<i>I want people to demonstrate moral outrage over undefended innocent property. </i>
<BR><BR>
Moral outrage will get you no where. Clever media manipulation can dramatically change the world while hardly spilling a single drop of blood. But you already know this.
<BR><BR>
<i>If you were a betting man, what would you wager that the next protest will be the biggest yeat? </i>
<BR><BR>
I am not a betting man, but I would still wager that the next protest will be as ineffectual as this one was unless the message can be simplified and promoted in sound bites. That's ugly reality for you. I know hundreds of people on a first name basis, but less than 10% of them are even aware that the G8 met in Genoa this past weekend.
<BR><BR>
<i>I'm uninterested in peacefully agreeing to buy what is offered for sale, I want to change the nature of the goods sold.</i>
<BR><BR>
As am I, but the vast majority has no problems with it. You will never change that, either. Again, that's ugly truth. The resistance to change is not because corporations are afraid of it but becaue most <i>people</i> are afraid of it.
<BR><BR>
<i>This is all about a loss of control over one's fate.</i>
<BR><BR>
Agreed, but don't hold any delusions about other people caring whether or not they have control over their fate. It is about <i>your</i> control over <i>your own</i> fate that is at issue. If you allow yourself to see it as something purely selfish then you will be much more successful in achieving your goals. And I really don't have a problem with that because what you want is a whole lot closer to what I want than the desires of the faceless, non-thinking masses. The ultimate irony is that it really is about elitism and believing that you know what is best for other people. Stop trying to believe that you have some common good in mind, because you don't. You are doing the same as all the other power brokers by trying to force your world vision onto the rest of the planet. I would like to see you succeed, but being teargassed and shot is not the most effective way to do so.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

 But there is also an ebb and flow of good stories and good discussion on K5, and when it is good it makes me feel good all around.  When things like this shooting in Genoa happen, it brings out the worst in people, and they fight over the stupidest things, and go off on the warpath based on nothing but preliminary reports and rumors.
<BR><BR>
It reminds me of the anti-Arab race riot that happened in Oklahoma City after the bombing there.  I wonder if there's a way to plan for things like this.  There are more demonstrations planned this summer, and the odds are good something terrible will happen at one of them.  And then there will be a bunch of people running off half-cocked, reacting way out of proportion even before anyone knows what really happened.
<BR><BR>
If you know ahead of time that will happen, can you think of a good way to respond?  Just ignore it?  Maybe remind them of the past?  When a child is crying and won't stop, you can play them a tape of their previous tantrum.  Shuts em right up.

There are sometimes exceptions to this all the same (such as Jin Wicked's wonderful 'Programming is not Art' article, which pissed them all off hugely, and yet they still voted it up) but usually not.<BR><BR>
We set up this website because it allows us to post whatever the hell we want, and hopefully (as the editors have varied opinions) there should be a steady diet of wildy varying views.<BR><BR>
Personally I have an fairly strong dislike for linux articles and reviews of this and that techie breakthrough now, I'm just completely sick of it and I amn't a computer buff anyway.<BR><BR>
And anything sufficiently controversial or funny that is submitted stands a good chance of being published as well. So it is a sort of liberation from the usual constraints.<BR><BR>
I'm also getting fed up of the whole kuro5hin/slashdot scene. I was talking to zikzak about this on IRC, and we both agreed that it is utterly tiresome now. We all want this site to have a varied audience, not just people in the computing industry or tangential to it and with the right political views.<BR><BR>

As new readers are, at the moment, coming from many different places and not just being stolen from the k5/slashdot readership we seem to be acheiving this, at least to some extent. Some of the articles have exposed a lot of people who don't usually visit weblogs at all to the site, and word of mouth is a factor too.<BR><BR>
I have also come to dislike meta-nonsense like this very comment too. The endless self referential crap gets on my wick. Personally, I don't want this website to be associated with the k5-/.-geekizoid triumvirate, I'd like it to be somewhat apart without much crossover (sort of like plastic is, but with better, funnier articles and users who aren't wankers).<BR><BR>

Particularly when you have little to suggest except what they've probably already discussed in IRC among themselves, and little to say except that you just 'don't like the discussion because it's not serious enough'?
<br><br>
If you want to have a discussion without appearance of sarcasm or irony, you are certainly free to do so.  But constantly criticisizing the editors' discussion style seems pointless (since they certainly won't change) and possibly does border on what 'trolling' might be considered on a site such as this (where the traditional sense of trolling is obviously meaningless)

<BR><BR>It would seem that I am suffering from a severe case of apathy.  If they want to think their shit doesn't stink, they're quite welcome to make that claim.  You're right:  it <em>is</em> their site.  They make the claim that everything posted is serious, except when meant in jest.  The fact is that in context everything seems to be humorous, except that the Editors (Infinite in Their Wisdom) make claims that various articles are meant in earnest when I can't tell them from the ones meant in jest.

<BR><BR>Until they delete me, I will exercise my right to free will and expression and call them on their shit.  It's providing me with great entertainment to find new ways to describe how their shit reeks and to see how they come up with explanations of how it doesn't.  I'm not Gisano claiming that anyone is raping my butt; I'm expounding on my deeply-held beliefs and considered opinions, which dmg claims is my right on this site.

<BR><BR>The problem is that my opinion is that this site is full of shit.  That isn't a terribly popular opinion, nor is it conducive to a pleasant day.
