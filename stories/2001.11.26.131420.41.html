Happy Thanksgiving.
<p>
Did you have a good holiday? Mine was pretty damn good. I took off work Wednesday so I got to Lansing around 5:00 (just in time for dinner) and left Sunday afternoon. I don't think I could have eaten any more food if I had wanted to.  It was truly decadent.  Months of eating to survive erased by copious amounts of Arabic food, desserts, bread, and of course turkey. And I got almost as much football as I got food, not to mention two Redwings games.
<p>
Most of the time when I wasn't eating or watching football I was reading or playing computer games, or hanging out with my little brother when he was around. He got an eighth of some really nice kb which him, my sister and I enjoyed Friday night and again Saturday night minus my sister. It was really fun. We talked about space, the vastness of the universe, the probability of intelligent life on other planets.  Also I apparently got him interested enough in Orientalism in Florida that he's going to write a research paper on it. I'm going to point him to some of the research I read about it when I wrote a paper on it. Anyway I was really glad to talk to him about all this stuff.  It was fun and it's good to know that he thinks about stuff like that.  To me anyhow.
<p>
He's a cop magnet though.  I got him pulled over Friday when we were getting my dad his birthday presents.  He was worried he was going to get a smoking ticket, but basically I got a warning for not wearing my seat belt.  Fucking lame, guess the cops in yuppieville don't have anything to do other than harass Scott.  Poor kid, he was pretty nervous.
<p>
So all in all I don't think I could have asked for any better of a vacation. I had some good bonding time with all of them.  I did lose 6 straight games of pool in a row to my dad, but I guess I made up for it by beating my brothers ass at super smash brothers (my favorite nintendo 64 game).
<p>
So the weekend before I went out camping with Kyle, his roommate Chad, and their respective ummm not girlfriends Steph and Marilyn.  I got pretty messed up two nights in a row and had a great time overall. The high point of the weekend was definately the Leonids meteor shower Saturday night.  We watched in for about 3 hours Saturday night and it was fucking incredible.  A couple meteors flashed brightly enough to light up the whole sky.  At first I had trouble deciding what was a meteor and what was me being fucked up but eventually I sobered up enough to realize that this shit really was happening.  
<p>
Let's see the weekend before that was the one I went to Little Rock.  That was really about as fun as I could have asked.  Somehow 'car bombs' seem to have become popular.  Basically this is half a guinness poured into a glass, with a shot of half irish whiskey and half irish cream slid into it.  You have to chug it, which is a little difficult but worth it.  I got pretty messed up both nights up there but I still managed to pound anybody foolish enough to think they could beat me at ping pong.  Everybody seems to be doing pretty good except for Sean getting laid off, but even that wasn't as bad as it could have been.  Hopefully he can find something at the beginning of the year when whatever independent stuff he's doing runs out.
<p>
Looks like I'm going to move in about a week.  I'm about 99% sure that I'm moving into a house with Kyle and Chad.  Hopefully by that time Chad dumps his spoiled brat slutty hypocritical Christian girlfriend by then so he can afford rent.  I am only about half convinced that living in a house with other people is a good idea, but if it ends up saving me about $4000 a year in rent, it's an experiment worth trying.
<p>
So yea.  Life's been pretty good lately, but I still have this nagging feeling like it's going too good, so I guess I've either created or magnified this worry I have about my job security.  I try not to think about it much.  You know I thought about halfway through this long ass email that I could probably call you to tell you about it all, but I guess I was too close to being done with it. So how are you?  How's your optimism and resolve holding up? *grin* I'm feeling pretty sold out lately but I guess it's mostly because I'm kind of in a standstill as far as life goes.  At least it's a good standstill I suppose.
<p>
So write me back I guess, I'd tell you to call but I'll probably be on the internet this week.  Hopefully when I move we get a cable modem so I can actually talk on the phone again.  I'll have to remember to email you my new number and all so we can talk some time, if you're into that sort of thing.
<p>
Take care of yourself, hope everything goes good for you.<br>
----
<p>So that ended up being a weird email. Some part of me feels obligated to write an email expounding on the great satisfaction I'm having with life in general, like she's going to wish she was still going out with me or whatever just because I'm happy. Of course I also genuinely liked talking to her and appreciated her opinions on stuff.  That's the bad thing about email, it's hard to have anything more than a superficial "here's an update on my life" type conversation.  Also I don't even know if she's interested in talking to me about life or whatever in a non superficial way, maybe she's too busy "living in the moment". I'm not sure when this "desire to share" started but it's like a disease.  Please, if any guy reads this I could use some support that I'm not losing the last vestiges of manhood by attempting any sort of meaningful communication with a female.<p>The one thing I didn't tell her about was the chick I talked to on the airplane.  Not that anything happened, but it's a small victory for me to make the effort to start a conversation and to actually keep it going for half an hour.  She lives in Austin, though (UT) so I didn't get her name or number.  Didn't ask her if she wanted to join the mile high club, which was my first (bad) instinct. First time in forever though that I got seated next to a cute girl on a plane.  Can't complain about that. <p>Like I said though, life is pretty good, especially if I can have a place to live next week.      <br><br></div>

I suppose I should explain a few things to you about relationships and the like.<BR><BR>When women say they "Just want to be friends" it means "Get the fuck out of my life you insolent loser." Okay? They don't really mean it but they feel so bad by dumping you that they have to say <i>something</i> nice.<BR><BR> It's like the "It's not you, it's me" dump or the "I just want to spend some time alone to get in touch with who I really am" dump or the "I think we're growing in different directions" dump. They don't mean any of it, they just want you the hell out of their life. They don't expect you to stay in touch, just like your when your buddy tells you that you should come to California and stay at his place for a vacation he doesn't really mean it. He's just being nice, that's all.<BR><BR>Now with regards to the email, about the only thing you could have done to make it worse would be if you offered to come over and wash her panties while she's working. I mean really. Here's what you need to to:<BR><BR>1) Find yourself a nice older latino woman. They are so freakin wild you won't have time to think about this ex trollop of yours.<br>2) Get a bunch of Sears power tools and make a workshop where you can build stuff. It's a real manly thing to do.<br>3) Get a 1972 Chevy Impala and start hanging out at the NAPA auto parts store buying gaudy crap for it. It's a good way to meet other manly men.<br>4) Shave your head.<br><br>Okay?<BR><br><br>Best wishes,<br>--S.Q. McNamera<BR></FONT></td>

Like you, I'm still hooked to an ex. I talked with mine on the phone tonight, btw. 
<BR>

<BR>
And like you, I savor the well accomplished communication with fuckable ladies met in transit. My circumstances being a bit more gutter level than yours, however, I meet my seat mates on long distance Gyerhound Bus rides rather than plane flights.

My late November is still being spent racing to the conclusion of my nano project. Here in San Antonio I find myself incredibly more productive than when I was in Indianapolis in the early part of the month. And I still appreciate the example of fluffy g. as she posted her nano progress.
<BR>

<BR>
Car bomb wise: damn! They sound delicious ...and expensive.
<BR>

<BR>
Ping pong wise: I'm good, very good on the table. Never in my life have I been very far from a table, and I've bested the Indiana and the Illinois state champions in the long, long ago. Even now, in this bohemian flat overlooking San Antonio's Riverwalk I have paddle and balls and whack away on a little table top table, (probably to the occassional dismay of my neighbors, though no one's yet complained.)
