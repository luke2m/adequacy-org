      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>I am sure many of you are wondering why I was using Linsux in the first place. It is simple: I was bored of using Windows 98 and the propaganda fed to me by Linsux zealots was convincing me that it was better than Microsoft Windows. For months of forcing myself to use Linsux, I was convinced that Linsux was indeed a great operating system, despite the lack of uniformity and the alpha feel of applications, both giving Linsux a truly Frankenstein feel. It simply isn't true. The pros and cons Linsux apologists are highly biased and highly exagerated as I will explain now.</p>
<p><b>Linsux's Immunity to Viruses</b></p>
<p>It is true that Linux is not as vulnerable to viruses as Microsoft Windows XP is, but anybody who is computer literate enough to run Linsux is computer literate enough to avoid any viruses that might do harm to one's system. Furthermore, anybody who is a target for a virus will have no problem logging into root and running the infected program in Linsux.</p>
<p><b>The Security Holes of Microsoft Windows</b></p>
<p>These holes have been patched, and it isn't like Linsux has holes either. It is simply that Linsux apologists love to make a big deal of the holes of Microsoft Windows XP while only mentioning theirs on <a href="http://www.mandrakesecurity.net">obscure security sites</a>. One can easily protect themselves from holes by using a firewall. XP will be vulnerable to security exploits without a firewall but Linsux will also be vulnerable.</p>
<p><b>Rumors of Microsoft Monopolizing</b></p>
<p>It is funny how people claim that Microsoft is a monopoly yet always claim how  Linsux is serious competition for Microsoft Windows. That statement contradicts itself. Besides, if Microsoft is such a monopoly, why can I go to my nearest Best Buy, Circuit City, or even Wal-Mart, and find a copy of some version (as long as you Linsux apologists call 98 and NT versions of Windows, I'll call Mandrake Linux and Redhat Linux versions of Linsux) of Linsux? For a monopoly, there sure are plenty of alternatives.</p>
<p>These same Linsux apologists also have a way of supporting companies such as Apple, IBM, Sony, and Sun, which have far more unethical tactics than Microsoft ever had. What is with your lack of consistency?</p>
<p>There might be uses for Linsux, such as learning how to build your own amateur operating system, but for regular desktop usage, Microsoft Windows XP is simply the superior operating system.</p>

<BR>
Firstly, Microsoft IS monopolizing!!  It's .NET system is designed to destroy existing LINUX ( it's not Linsux and it's very discrediting for you to insult it that way ), UNIX, and OpenBSD networking systems that exist already.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, where's your proof, credit, and accountability on all of this?  Why are ALL Linux apologists the way you say they are?  And besides, Windows wouldn't exist without IBM and Sony.  Microsoft has made very little of their own operating system.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, firewalls are useless against any hacker who really knows what they are doing.  If you wanna get in, you will.
<BR>

<BR>
Root accounts increase security immesely.  Many of the bugs in Microsoft's OS' could be fixed if they put things in a localhost administrator account.  But they don't.
<BR>

<BR>
Note:  People complain of Microsoft's anti-competitve / monopolistic activities.  The lack of open source software and GNU licenses on some of their software makes it impossible for developers to produce at their full potential.
<BR>

<BR>
Really, you're wrong because Windows XP is NOT a superior OS.  there is none.  Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages that make them unique.  In reality, relating 1 OS to another is relating an apple to an apple pie.  You can compare tastes and likenesses, but they aren't the same.

Nope. XP can do everything Lunix can do and do it much better. Absolutely everything. Do you understand this? There is nothing Lunix does which XP cannot do better. Nothing. As a bonus, XP runs the widest variety of useful, polished, easy to use applications -- but that's just icing on the cake.
<BR><BR>
Wait. There is something Lunix is good for. Lunix is good for people who enjoy running a second rate clone of a second rate, ancient OS called UNIX. I am not intimate with these people's pathologies, but apparently there's some thrill to cobbling together an endless series perl scripts for mundane, "house keeping" tasks which that get in the way of useful work and which XP handles automatically, as it should.

<BR>

<BR>
Really?  I love how you say this YET, YET...Linux running almost any WINDOWS game in a non-native environment properly will run better.
<BR>

<BR>
YET, Linux is a much easier programming environment which allows you to program in more languages natively ( no buying extra stuff ) than Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
YET, Linux is a more secure and much faster operating system than Windows XP is ( check benchmarks my friend ).
<BR>

<BR>
YET, Linux has MORE software available than windows.
<BR>
Check sites such as:
<BR>
www.rpmfind.com
<BR>
http://freshmeat.net
<BR>
www.linux.com
<BR>
www.osdn.com
<BR>
www.gnu.org ( information )
<BR>
You'll find FREE software that, in some cases, does better work that Microsoft's similar software.
<BR>

<BR>
you say that windows is better, YET, Microsoft has never released a bug-free operating system that worked fine out of the box with no major system problems or security holes since MS-DOS days.
<BR>

<BR>
also, I'd like to mention that if users used LINUX they could update their system in mere seconds using shell scripts that don't require effort but are fully customizable.
<BR>

<BR>
also, I'd like to mention that you aren't forced ( even though MS denies it, I've never gotten XP to work right without using it ) to use Internet Explorer.
<BR>

<BR>
also, I'd like to mention that Linux's cost is significantly cheaper than that of that of the similar Windows ( 79.99 for Mandrake 8.1 Pro vs. 299.99 for Windows XP pro ).
<BR>

<BR>
Not to mention that Windows XP requires constant driver updates and doesn't use any form of hardware manipulation, which regulates your ability to use hardware.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, Windows XP requires you to do things like activate software and what-not.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows OS's requires you to download multiple updates before any installed Operating System is really usable to it's full potential.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows XP is NEVER FREE ( Legally )!
<BR>

<BR>
Microsoft does not support open source ( and I'm suprised any of it works ).
<BR>

<BR>
You cannot obtain a Microsoft update from any other webpage ( legally ) than Microsoft's own ( to my knowledge ).
<BR>

<BR>
it doesn't offer you fair chances to install/not install any of it's own software and tries to force you to use ONLY the ones they want.
<BR>

<BR>
it gives you no options suitable for a fully customizable system.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows XP has HARD CODED AGP TIMINGS ( which prevents overclocking of the front-side bus ).  Done in Windows XP -- it's the nature of a lot of the nVidia BSOD's ( with nv.dsp's infinite loop ).
<BR>

<BR>
Microsoft attacks Open Source agencies and drives other companies out of business.
<BR>

<BR>
etc..etc.. ( i went on far to long :p )
<BR>

<BR>
Also, everything i've listed is a fact.  I use Windows XP on my laptop and used to use it on this very computer.  Windows XP is a slow, unstable, resource hog.  I've been using Linux for 3 months now and have never gotten a slowdown, lockup, or any other form of system crash.  Ever.  A friend of mine who attends my college has been running Linux for about 4 weeks without a single reboot, no crashes.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows is Simply NOT a superior OS.  Any good programmer will tell you this.  It's a horrid, poorly designed, SLOW operating system from a company who's known to produce more security holes than useful programs ( just look at their windows update site already for XP ).

Until there is a LINUX distro that your ordinary Windows user can install and use for email, surfing, word processing, games, listening to music, etc. etc. without considerable effort/knowledge, it will not make huge gains with the general computer public.  I have installed and used Mandrake without ever successfully connecting to the internet (damn those winmodems!) It does seem to be very stable and the price is right (can't beat free!!) but the learning curve for someone without the time or inclination to figure out how to operate in some other manner than point and click is too steep.  People with jobs, kids, tv shows to watch, yards to mow, cars to wash, etc. just don't have the patience and I'm afraid that these people probably make up the largest percentage of computer users.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Allow me to clarify: if you boot XP  to  a port of bash written without any win32 calls -- MS  Explorer shell is just another program -- it will be like a fast Lunix on steroids. If you boot to the usual Explorer shell or a graphical replacement like  WindowsBlinds (similiar to replacing X with Berlin -- ha!), it will be like a fast Lunix on steroids which never seizes (unlike X), looks nice (unlike X), is easy to use (unlike X), presents a coherent, predictable UI, and runs the widest <i>variety</i> of useful software. Not  umpteen versions of vi; not "scratch my itch" or homework assignment scripts on Freshmeat (although they run on Windows, too); not  the abandoned abortions on SourceForge which would be blatant ripoffs of existing Windows software were it not for the fact that the subset of functionality they try to emulate doesnt work well.

In the original versions of Microsoft Windows XP you couldn't overclock your nVidia GeForce cards ( I had a GF3 ) because of an AGP hard coded timing issue.  But I also note that these problems occured in boards such as Abit, IWill, and SOYO ( boards who don't use software AGP timings ).

Microsoft OSes won't be a big deal until BlackComb (codename) which  is supposed to fully realise .NET.  Of course we'll have to wait for Longhorn (codename) first.  Ms claims BlackComb will be released in 2005/6.  Of course they have been promising it since 1998.

<BR><BR>Of course Apple supports open source. That's why they are, as you Linsux lusers have said, hardware monopolists, and why they are telling everybody that they can't copy the Aqua design, make Darwin so that any change you make to it must be sent back to Apple, and why they've ported QuickTime to open source OS's (which they haven't). Microsoft meanwhile, also supports open source by using BSD software in their software, porting IE to Unix, etc.

Actually a Firewall under a Linux system IS a more secure firewall because the directory tree itself is, in essence, firewalled in most distributions, thus meaning you have TWO firewalls instead of just one.  not to mention Code Red targeted Windows machines last I checked, as does Code Red II!

If you read about Windows XP ( Such as inside-out books ) you'll find that the administrator account still exists.  It's supposed to be a NULL account that only starts up universal services.  Unfortunately, you can also enter this account.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'm no "computer whiz," but I decided to try Linux because I kept hearing it mentioned on the Internet. Now, I'm obviously not one of those "hackers," but I programmed some Fortran in college and a little Visual Basic more recently, and I basically know my way around a computer pretty well, so you'd think I'd be the kind of guy who'd like Linux, right? Well, no. To make a long story short, I wansn't impressed.

<BR><BR>Ok, I'll make a short story long. (LOL!)

<BR><BR>I got a Linux user to install it for me, so I don't know how hard it was, but it looked pretty strange and he deleted the "Manual Boot Record" (maybe a Linux user would know what that means). Anyway, I was real pleased once he finished. It kind of looked like Windows, only it marked me as a sophisticated and intelligent computer user! Or something like that.

<BR><BR>Then...the nightmare began. First, Internet Explorer isn't available, only inferior browsers like Netscape and Konqueror. But that's ok, I can live with a browser that crashes every half hour, right? Well, it turns out there were other things I couldn't live with, like:

<ul>
<li>The lack of a good word processor or spreadsheet application.</li>
<li>The snotty, superior attitude of Linux users when asked simple questions like, "How can I set up my Sound Card?"</li>
<li>The absence of Windows functionality like Shortcuts--they sure make things easier for me!</li>
<li>Having to recompile the kernel to do practically anything.</li>
<li>The inability to copy and paste.</li>
<li>How the HELL can I do a simple thing like rename a file?!</li></ul>
This <i>by no means</i> exhausts my complaints with Linux. It merely scratches the surface of my immense frustration with this (non-)operating system.

<BR><BR>Best of all, I got "hacked" inside of a week. That was the last straw. I re-installed Windows 98 and everything was just great--it was like entering a warm house after being out in a snowstorm! I've <i>never</i> been hacked running Windows. I think my experience proves that those geeks who claim Linux is more secure than Windows are morons.

<BR><BR>I hope all non-computer experts take my advice and step real carefully around Linux. If it's for anyone, it's for obsessed nerds with the spare time to learn the minute details of an operating system that makes DOS seem easy to use. It's <i>not</i> for people like us.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Setting up a sound card isn't easy for any operating system.  It assumes that your OS has a copy of the necessary drivers.  For a new user, setting up a sound card on a Windows machine is a nightmare.  For an expert, setting up a sound card on a Windows machine is a pain in the ass.  Windows only allocates a very limited amount of resources, and a lot of higher-end soundcards require more than their fair share of those resources.  My condolences for the snotty responses, though.  Snobs will be snobs, no matter what operating system you run.

<BR><BR>I understand that the KDE is still in its relative infancy.  However, what you want is probably out there.  Check Linux software sites to find what you want.  One of the features I love about Unix windows is the ability to switch back and forth between processes just by holding my mouse over the desired window.

<BR><BR>You can't copy and paste in Unix?  You can't use your keyboard, or even your mouse?  You're right.  Unix environments are <strong>not</strong> for you.

<BR><BR>How do you rename a file in Unix?  By typing "mv &lt;oldfilename&gt; &lt;newfilename&gt;".  It's that keyboard thing again.  Sorry to bring up that painful topic.  It helps to read up on what you're jumping into before you jump into it.

<BR><BR>Well, that's not true. In fact, SpaceGhoti, you demonstrate an amusingly cavalier attitude towards the facts that goes hand in hand with your arrogant spite. In fact, I'm not sure if you're attempting to "troll" me or not, but I'll take you seriously, and if that means you get some sick amusement out of denigrating your technical inferior, so be it. Herewith:
<ul><li>All versions of Netscape have crashed every 30 minutes since the beginning of time. Or perhaps my unique aura is unfavorable to the operation of computer software (I have, in fact, long suspected this).</li>
<li>If IE crashes, <i>ever</i>, you've got a problem. It shouldn't. It doesn't for me or anyone else I know (are you using the correct version?). And no other browser is as fast or renders as many pages correctly as IE. Even many Linux advocates admit this.</li>
<li>Setting up a sound card: I'll have you know that I've set up sound cards in DOS (DOS!) with <i>far</i> less trouble than I've had with Linux. But clearly I'm just a yammering idiot, right, SpaceGhoti?</li>
<li>Regarding copy and paste: I understand the concept of copy and paste fine, thank you. I am merely curious why, when I "copy" in (for example) Konqueror, and select "paste" in a different program, like Emacs, why doesn't it paste what I copied? What incredibly obvious principle am I missing, SpaceGhoti?</li>
<li>As for the "root password," I would have to ask my friend whether he changed it (from what?) or not. Although I do not see why it should matter.</li></ul>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Well, here's the first shocker:  I am not a Linux user.  I don't know enough about Unix administration, only user-level.  I log onto Unix machines other people run to use them (with permission, thankyouverymuch).  Eventually, when I find employment in my new home city, I'll put together two machines:  the first will be a Windows environment (because I know how to build it), and the second will be a Linux environment (because I don't know how to build it, and I want to learn).  My comments to you were restricted to either Windows administration (like the sound card installation) or user-level Unix commands (mv).  I did not speak to that which I did not know.


<BR><BR>Here's the second shocker:  Netscape is very stable for me.  Always has been, always will be.  I've kept Netscape open for days on end, clicking back and forth to my favorite sites with nary a hiccup.  It's fast, it's easily customizable and I'm comfortable with it.  IE is also stable, but I like it less.  I don't like the feel and customization as much, mostly.  Yes, it does crash on me more often than Netscape, but I didn't intend to imply that it crashes all the time.  I usually use the second-to-latest and greatest version of IE, because I know better than to use a Microsoft product straight off the development floor.

<BR><BR>Here's the third shocker:  I'm not mocking you.  Some of my statements may have been mocking (probably toward the end, as your complaints becaming whining and petty), but overall I was attempting to sympathize and answer some of your complaints.  You don't have to like Linux.  I'm easy that way.  You go with what you like, I'll go with what I like.  I don't do the OS/browser holy wars.  My preferences are based on my own research and experience.  Yours are based on whatever motivates you.  That's fine by me, and at no time did I mock you or otherwise insinuate hostile sentiments for your preference of Windows.

<BR><BR>Here's the last and final shocker:  your friend might be your hacker.  If your friend set it up and you didn't change your root password after setup was complete, then your friend had the key to get in and do whatever he wanted with your computer.  I'm not saying he <strong>did</strong> do it; it might have been someone else.  But as the police would say, he's the primary suspect.  Read up on hacking and crime sometime; you'll find that the butler does it more often than not.

<BR><BR>Enjoy your Windows experience.  Linux isn't for you, and that's not a bad thing.  It just is.<BR><BR><BR>A troll's <a href="./2002.1.5.184242.7637.html#31">true colors</a>.<BR></FONT></td>

Then again I do find internet explorer does crash quite a lot more than netscape. Unless you have both installed then the only reason netscape crashes is because internet explorer causes it!!
<BR>

<BR>
What web authors should do is write the web pages to be compatible with both browsers but they often only bother with IE and thats why netscape sometimes displays the pages wrong - its not netscapes fault.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe the reason you couldnt do half the stuff in linux is because you didnt know the commands and where stuff was. You cant say windows is easier just because you know all the DOS commands.
<BR>
I find windows easier than Linux but thats because Ive been using it all my life not because its better or anything.
<BR>
Internet Explorer and Windows are both Microsoft products so they designed them to allow copying and pasting between them. Same with notepad. If programmers want to allow their programs they have to use the API. Maybe Linux doesnt have a copy-paste environment or maybe netscape wasnt programmed to do it - a lot of windows programs wont allow you to copy and paste stuff to other programs too.

you aren't in windows... did you ever think to ask someone or maybe read a little bit on it BEFORE you installed the os? didn't think so. if you highlight the text you want copied, and you have a three-wheel mouse, clicking the middle mouse button will copy anything highlighted.

Name five Linux advocates that admit this. IE renders pages htat are sepcifically coded for IE more "correctly" but for the vast majority of sites out there, this is an incorrect statement.

<BR>
Yup, you are a yammering idiot. SuSE, Mandrake, RedHat and a new distro ELX, all recognize my sound cards, install the proper drivers and set the cards up.  The first time that I log in to KDE, I hear the lovely KDE sound theme. Besides, if you had ever really done this in DOS, you surely could have done it in Linux, since there is NOTHING to do!

<BR>
Of course you do not see why it would matter, since win9x has no security at all.  Anyone logging in to your copmuter has access to all of your data, by default, under Win9x.  Since this is a huge problem, you really need to upgrade to an NT box, at least. By default, under Linux, no one in my house that uses my computer can hurt it in any way, shape or form.  They can hose their won home directory, but my stuff is safe.  Do you understand why it matters now?

The world is not safe with people like you around.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Understand that Unix was first developed by bored computer techs with more of a sense of humor than practicality.  Many commands are abbreviations of what the developer thought it was supposed to do, which is why you have <code>cp, mv, grep, sed, awk</code> et al.  No, Unix is <strong>not</strong> intuitive, and probably never will be.  It requires time, patience and research to master.

<BR><BR>Many years ago I bought a second-hand car.  It was a 1980 Ford Mustang, and I'd never driven a manual shift Ford before.  My experience with manual shift had always been with Toyota.  So damn me if I didn't find the reverse gear to be broken!  It absolutely <strong>refused</strong> to accept that gear!  I spent a few days working around this handicap, until someone more familiar with cars than I was pointed out that the reverse gear in a manual shift Ford is slightly different.  You have to push to the side, then sort of angle down.  Lo and behold, my car had a reverse gear after all!

<BR><BR>The moral of this story is that before you assume something is broken, it helps to read the manual first.  In the case of Unix, it helps to pick up a book and discover what undiscovered country you're about to travel.  Unix is a world apart from Windows, and you can't expect it to be like a Bill Gates production.  Linux is attempting to introduce Unix to the common user, but somebody needs to add a disclaimer that it requires a new skillset.  Perhaps in time somebody will add more shortcuts to KDE to give more of a "Windows" feel to it, but I get the feeling that would defeat the purpose.  They don't want to emulate Windows, they want to offer an alternative.<BR><BR><BR>A troll's <a href="./2002.1.5.184242.7637.html#31">true colors</a>.<BR></FONT></td>

If you're looking for a user friend, easy, and something that offers both ease of use AND gives you the overall ability to customize and do advanced things without destroying the system go for Mandrake 8.1.  It's a little bit more now, but the cost is worth it.
<BR>

<BR>
It comes packaged with an app called Star Office ( take MS office and give it the ability to take just about ANY document type!! ), automatic drive, Sound Card, Video Card, X setup, and USB detection.  Ease of use!  Decent shortcuts, new technology, support for just about EVERYTHING, good sound, and over 10,000 rpms & tar.gz's!!
<BR>

<BR>
You can basically do ANYTHING you would want to with Windows on this Linux distribution ( I sound like a commercial ) and the install is VERY automated.
<BR>

<BR>
You can go so easy as clicking buttons and answering questions all the way to manually fdisking and choosing packages!
<BR>

<BR>
If'n your new to Linux or don't have to mess with it but want the benefits, Mandrake is for you!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I've been reading up about this RedmondLinux and how it's supposed to make the switch to Linux extremely easy and be a great desktop distro.  Of course I am a little cautious about installing it on my system.  There seems to be a lot of confusion and talk around by the RL developers especially about the licensing.

There are a multitude of groups (I hesitate to use the word 'company' to describe them) out there who put together their particular version of Linux. Red Hat, Mandrake, KDE, Gnome, Turbo Linux, Caldera, Bee Hive, Corel, PPC, Debian, Sackware, Helix, Connectiva. I could go on for hours. Contrast this with Windows, there is just one single version out there at any particular time. (Yes, I know there are Professional, Home, etc. but those are more about what tools come with the OS, not entirely different systems). That one system is backed by a huge company with top notch technical support. Can that be said about any version of Linux? No!<BR><BR>
Essentially, all of these people who put out distributions are just standing in line behind the multitude of others who came before them in trying to make something useful out of Linux. It is impossible. No one has yet made a distribution that people like, no one has yet made one that people are willing to pay for. Please tell your fellow hackers to give up.

This is why Linux can support up to 8 Processors, Unlimited amounts of RAM ( Windows XP is limited to 7 GB ), has no hard drive limitations, and is also why you don't have to buy new versions to get updates for a lot of new hardware and what-not.

Anyway, I was real pleased once he finished. It kind of looked like Windows, only it marked me as a sophisticated and intelligent computer user! Or something like that. 
<BR>

<BR>
That is the Master Boot Record.  The thing that BG loves for his OS to overwrite, since you then have to repair it to get all of your OS's working if you are multi-booting OS's.
<BR>

<BR>
--The lack of a good word processor or spreadsheet application. 
<BR>

<BR>
Well, there you have it, folks. The wintroll has shown is true colors.  How can it be that you found no good wordprocessors or spreadsheets? Have you heard of StarOffice, WordPerfect, KOffice, Applixware? 
<BR>

<BR>
--The snotty, superior attitude of Linux users when asked simple questions like, "How can I set up my Sound Card?" 
<BR>

<BR>
Read the post in alt.os.windows-xp, if you really want to see people get ugly.  These are windoze users who call other windoze users idiots because they cannot get the supposedly most simply OS in the world to act the way it is expected to.  Sound card problems, mysterious reboots, setting up a home network--all of it is there is black and white.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
--The absence of Windows functionality like Shortcuts--they sure make things easier for me!
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Hmm, let's see...  Yup! Under KDE, setting up a shortcut is identical as doing it under windoze--are you sure that you tried Linux?
<BR>

<BR>
--Having to recompile the kernel to do practically anything. 
<BR>

<BR>
Nope, you have never used Linux. No one needs to recompile a kernel, anymore.  All of it is loaded as modules when you need it.  This is thx to those windoze losers who cannot figure out what software they really need.  Bullshit, you say? Well, why does windoze need to load drivers for every piece of hardware that ever existed, during the install.  I have no SCSI devices in my computer, but if I ever get one, I know that MS installed it for me.
<BR>

<BR>
--The inability to copy and paste. 
<BR>

<BR>
Do you know how to use a mouse?  I thought not.  See they work the same under Linux and windoze--only under Linux it is much better, since I do not need to open a dialogu box and click on copy, then paste.  Under Linux, I simply use the middle mouse button. Sure, under windoze, I can do ctrl-v, ctrl-c, but that takes longer than highlighting test and pressing the middle mouse button where I want the text to be pasted. And yes, I can set up shortcut keys in KDE to do all of this without the mouse, but why bother?
<BR>

<BR>
--How the HELL can I do a simple thing like rename a file?!
<BR>

<BR>
In Linux, there are things called window managers and if you right-click on a file, you can rename it, copy it, move it, do whatever you damned well please, since it is really difficult to use cp * *, or mv * '.  Windoze has something similar called windoze explorer, in case you don't know.  
<BR>

<BR>
--I hope all non-computer experts take my advice and step real carefully around Linux. If it's for anyone, it's for obsessed nerds with the spare time to learn the minute details of an operating system that makes DOS seem easy to use. It's not for people like us.
<BR>

<BR>
Nope, it is not for the stupid masses who have become used to being controlled by others, lack the ability to form an intelligent opinion after doing real research, who have forgotten that learning can be fun and that reading is truly fundamental.  Even BG uses Linux, how else is he going to "innovate?"<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The flaws, first reported by The Associated Press Thursday, create an extensive playground for malicious hackers. One permits hackers to take complete control of a victim's computer from anywhere on the Internet. Another allows a computer criminal to mass an entire network of computers into a denial-of-service attack by issuing a single set of instructions.
<BR>
       The vulnerabilities exist in a new Universal Plug and Play service installed by default in all Windows XP systems.

And about the "extreme vunerability to hacking of lunix". You said that hacker has to hack into the comp and pretty much try to crack the root password. The thing is atleast linux has a administrator login for the hackers to try and get through but guess what? WINDOWS DOESNT HAVE ONE! So the hacker would find it much easier to hack windows than linux because they dont have to mess with passwords and other things that makes LINUX MORE SECURE THAN WINDOZE.
<BR>
And about Windoze not monopolizing, due you are one brainwashed fucker. Microsoft runs on 95% of all the computers on the world!!!!

If it is going to compete in such a fashion, it needs to innovate instead of imitate. There have been a number of articles lately talking about user interface design which say that the desktop isn't the best metaphor for the computer. What's better? I'm not sure, but maybe Linux should try to come up with that answer instead of making crappy attempts at re-creating the Microsoft look. Why can't I just right-click the desktop to change my X resolution? Simple things like this piss me off.

It's also funny how when Linux has serious holes, you Linux users always make up excuses such as "the security flaws in 2.4.16 are irrelevant, as they will easily be fixed by by a simple patch." It seems that patching flaws in Linux is fine, but you criticize Windows XP without end for holes, that have been fixed already.

<BR><BR>We Windows users never say Windows NEVER crashes. You Linux users are the ones who are always saying how Linux never crashes. I guess that's true if all you ever use is the console and vi, but if you use Linux like we use Windows, it will crash occasionally. I know that from experience. By the way, I have been using Windows XP for a couple days now and it has not crashed yet, while Linux did have the tendancy to crash every so often when I first used it.

You're mistaken. For equivalent prices, the Apple always wins, since about last year. In every way except memory architecture (and the next generation Apple computers will have rambus, so that problem will be solved). 


<BR><BR>The megahertz count of a computer isn't really a performance metric. You could happily do a lot of comparisons, and I happily find that my machine tends to come out ahead. You can easily grab a 1+ Ghz machine from Dell, a P4, with monitor, for about $1100. For $1500, you can get an Apple wih monitor that wins on FLOPS and MIPS, that can simply run complicated programs faster due to architecture differences ( I'll spare you the details ) and only runs at 733mhz! If you are a student or educator, that can be much cheaper.

<BR><BR>Apple might have screwed itself over, but that doesn't mean it won't be a competitor soon. Hardware aside, Mac OS X squarely beats Windows XP. In what way? The only meaningful way when you get rid of hardware: Features. Name something Windows XP can do, and I'll give you the mac equivalent, prebundled. Heck, if you are really attached (emotionally or economically) to MS products, they've been ported, and work quite well.

<BR><BR>Have you played with a Mac OS X machine with an open mind? It's a remarkable OS. Now, if Apple just drop's it's prices 5-15%, they'll actually be in a position to really mess with the marketshare MS holds. Heck, if they just ported OS X to x86, that right there would be pretty much enough to put them in a real war, one they stand to win, given the current state of Windows XP.

<BR><BR>I'm not paying hundreds of dollars for an OS that is just a shiny polished Win2k. XP home has the raw sockets problem.

<BR><BR>Glad you found happiness in Windows XP. It's a decent OS. For people who "like to live in Disneyland" it's fine. You are missing out though, give OS X a try.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I know about the difference in megahertz, but unless there was a noticeable difference, unlike in Linux compared to Windows XP, in performance on similar priced hardware, I'd go with the PC.
<BR><BR>OS X does look nice, but unless it is actually superior to Windows XP and not just a matter of taste (or propaganda like from the Linsux camp), I'll stick with Windows XP because broke isn't where I want to go today. :)<BR><i>Guardian angel, heavenly friend, walk with me 'til the journey's end.</i><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR><cite>I know about the difference in megahertz, but unless there was a noticeable difference, unlike in Linux compared to Windows XP, in performance on similar priced hardware, I'd go with the PC.</cite>
<BR><BR>A reasonable stance to take, but I assure you, comparatively priced machines exist! Go to the Apple Store, set a budget of $1300, and you'll be amazed at what you get. For instance, an iMac is, dollar for dollar, about as good as those cruddy little Dell Systems people have been buying so much lately. The components are high quality, you don't need SO-SDRAM anymore, and they are no longer obsessed with goofy colors. :) 

<BR><BR>Of course, the iMac has a rea stigma around it, and I'd advice waiting 3-5 months for the G4e iMacs to be finished, but other than that, it's a good deal. Especially as a workstation. I work at a lab that owns 4-5 of them, and once people get past the "iMac's are stupid because they have 1 button mice" nonsense, then they use them more than most of the Dell machines.

<BR><BR>I'm looking at the iBook pricing page right now, and $1299 for the low end laptop is pretty nice. It has about everything you need, and a lot more power (and battery life, with only 1 battery! These things are very light, as opposed to the VAIO line Sony has 2 batteries in for the ultimate in repetitive low stress weight lifting.

<BR><BR>Anyways, Apple's low end hardware is quite nice, people just don't look at is as much because their high-end stuff is so much more desirable. Even the lowest level machine in the desktop line or the tiBook series is an amazing machine, capable of a lot, even at that price range.

<BR><BR>I do agree with you to some extend, if Apple lowered their prices (as I said) they'd be truly competitive. I am the kind of person who wants the best operating system on the market, and from what I can see everything about Mac OS X is superior to WinXP, both home and pro.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
