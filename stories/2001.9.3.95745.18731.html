If you are like me you have probably seen those guys who <a href="http://www.maxpower.co.uk">tune up their automobiles</a> and thought to yourself: "Well, they may have <a href="http://www.highpower.freeserve.co.uk/carnitrous.htm">better</a> <a href="http://www.superchips.com/">performance</a>, but what is their <a href="http://www.casema.net/~kroone/gas/gas.html">gas</a> <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/drive.shtml">milage</a> like ?"<p>
It is the same with PCs. For some time now guys in the office where I work have been tweaking their PCs, making all sorts of modifications (in nerdspeak: "Overclocking their CPUs") in the name of performance. They are <a href="http://www.extremeoverclocking.com">hell</a> <a href="http://www.octools.com/">bent</a> on squeezing <a href="http://firingsquad.gamers.com/guides/overclocking/default.asp">every last MHz</a> from their PC investment. This is to be admired. It is, in fact, <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/">the American way</a>.
They even have their own <a href="http://www.hardocp.com">websites</a> <a href="http://www.anandtech.com">dedicated</a> to <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com">extracting</a> <a href="http://www.overclockers.co.uk">every</a> <a href="http://www.overclockers.com">last ounce</a> of <a href="http://www.sharkeyextreme.com">performance</a> from their machines. However, like those guys with the customized <a href="http://www.motorcities.com/contents/01H8B504817549.html">Civics</a> and <a href="http://www.motorcities.com/contents/00GCA134110573.html">Accords</a>, we have to wonder what is the <a href="http://www.ncpa.org/studies/s165/s165.html">environmental impact</a> of these modifications, and even more importantly how will it affect the lifespan of the PC ?<p>
Before I explain how you can improve the longevity of your PC I need to explain what overclocking is, and the negative effects it can have. We can then see how my solution adresses these issues.<p>
Overclocking in a nutshell is the <a href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html">illegal</a> act of running a computer's CPU at a higher clock speed than that <a href="http://support.intel.com/support/processors/pentiumiii/sb/1021814013048256.htm">mandated by the manufacturer</a>. By altering the settings on the BIOS of your motherboard, it is possible to fool your computer into running faster than the manufacturer's permitted speed limit. This results in a short term gain for the overclocker, but it is not <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks">without risk</a> to the <a href="http://www.walletwatch.com/">wallet</a>, or the <a href="http://www.sepp.org/NewSEPP/environmyths.htm">environment</a>.<p>
To quote the US Dept of Energy and the EPA: <i>"Staying within the speed limit is not only a matter of safety and obeying the law, it can also save you money." </i><p>
The sound advice above applies equally to Personal Computers as it does to automobiles, which is hardly surprising, since both are complex pieces of machinery requiring their users to behave in a responsible manner.
<p>
Anyway enough <a href="http://www.preaching.org/">preaching</a>, its time to get down to the technical nitty-gritty. For the purposes of this article, it is useful to draw an analogy between PCs and Automobiles. If you tune up an auto by adding a <a href="http://www.turbocharger.co.uk/">turbocharger</a>, or remapping the fuel injection and timing, you may well get a small increase in performance. However it will be at the expense of wear and tear on your engine, more greenhouse gas emissions, increased insurance premiums, and ultimately the lifespan of your vehicle will be shortened. So it is with PCs.<p>
The overclocked PC consumes more electricity than the unmodified PC (due to the higher clock speeds, and the additional cooling that is required). This causes higher running costs (just take a look at your electric bill if you don't believe me), more damage to the <a href="http://www.americanpolicy.org/prop/congressafraid.htm">enviroment</a>, due to the emission of more poisonous greenhouse gasses, and worst of all, reducing the lifespan of your CPU.<p>
A CPU is a delicate piece of electronics. Illegally increasing the clock speed by just 2MHz can remove 6 months from its working lifespan.<p>
<strong>Modify your PC to improve its longevity</strong><br>
OK, so we have seen the causal link between higher clock speeds and early CPU failure. But what can we do to improve the lifespan of our PC ? Its simple. The same equation that governs the process of "overclocking" can easily be reversed. It is the logical next step. If a faster CPU has a shorter lifespan, costs more to run and <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/News/34/30/siliconhell.html">damages the environment</a>, by the same token, an <i><a href="http://support.intel.com/support/processors/celeron/sb/10216952721789571.htm">underclocked</a></i> CPU will be proportionally cheaper to run, more environmentally friendly and will last longer. Follow the simple steps below to underclock your CPU and improve the lifespan of your PC<p>
Basically there are three steps to underclocking your CPU. The first step is to get into the computer's BIOS. This can normally be done by pressing DEL as the machine boots up.<p>
The second step is to locate the CPU clock multiplier in the BIOS menus, and modify it. Suppose you want to increase the lifespan of your CPU by a factor of two. The thing to do is to halve the clock multiplier in the BIOS.<p>
The third step is to save your changes to the BIOS and reboot. VOILA - you are now the proud owner of a longer-lasting, greener, cheaper to run PC.<p>
Now you might be wondering what the downside is to all this ? Good news. As it turns out, there is no downside. For years and years PC manufacturers have been telling us we needed <a href="http://www.intel.com/intel/museum/25anniv/hof/moore.htm">faster and faster CPUS</a>. This is simply not the case. I run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office">Microsoft Word</a> just as easily on my underclocked Dell machine, with the bonus of knowing my PC will probably outlast that of all my friends, and is saving me money to boot.<p>
For any reasonably competent DIY enthusiast, underclocking is a no-brainer, and the sooner you do it, the sooner you can start saving money and join the ranks of <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7Erarnold/ecotest.htm">those</a> who are <a href="http://www.cffar.org/vandalwatch/faces/index.html">doing their bit</a> to reduce <a href="http://www.cfact.org/IssueArchive/greenhouse.bp.n97.txt">global warming</a>.<p>
There is some evidence to suggest that if just 5% of America's PC-owning population underclocked their PCs by a miniscule 5% then the <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/california-power.htm">Californian power crisis</a> would have been averted, and we would be able to reduce greenhouse <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/010510044543.xobn4nus.html">gas emissions</a> by a significant amount.<p>
We have to start protecting our environment somewhere, so what better place to start protecting it than at home ?

All decent PCs that a person can buy today have a "good enough" lifespan.  They're designed to operate for the forseeable future, well beyond the point at which they become obsolete.  Oh, sure .. there are some upgrades that you can do to an old PC in order to speed it up (such as adding extra RAM, ROM, or RIMM.)  But the fact of the matter is that with today's technology, PCs become obsolete a year or so after they are purchased.  They can continue to be used for (maybe) a couple of years past that.<BR><BR>

At that point, it's your duty to purchase another one.<BR><BR>

The advances in technology that we've seen in the past decade have not come for free.  They've taken a lot of research and development (R&D) dollars.  Hardware corporations are not going to be able to do this R&D if people purchase one PC from them and keep it for a decade.  If you want to keep the industry and the economy moving in the proper direction, it is your obligation as a moral person to procure another computer from these companies on a regular basis (say, once every three years.)<BR><BR>

Personally, I think it's a bit irresponsible to suggest that people ought to "underclock" their computers to make them last longer and consume less power.  If <i>any</i> modifications are to be made, it should be overclocking; furthermore, people should leave all of their overclocked computers turned on 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The energy companies are a vital component of the modern economy, and ensuring that they get a steady cash flow is just good common sense.  Furthermore, oil and gas CEOs need to feed <i>their</i> families just as much as you need to feed <i>yours</i> .. perhaps you're being selfish?<BR><BR>

At any rate, your article sounds like it's dangerously close to environmentalism.  You might want to think twice before you advocate a full frontal assault on American business in the name of eco-terrorism.  Reality check: A couple of thousand dollars to the computer companies every three years is not that much to ask.  When the stability of the economy is at stake, it's the duty of all moral citizens to consume conspicuously.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

You are incorrect. What happens is that the operating system becomes obsolete, and people are too lazy to go to the store and buy an upgrade, so they simply replace their machine.<BR><BR>
While you are correct in your assertion that <strong>"it's the duty of all moral citizens to consume conspicuously"</strong>, there are other ways to spend money on your PC without replacing it.<BR><BR>
A well known <i><strong>American</strong></i> corporation exists which can take up the slack in terms of any reduced consumption were people to follow my underclocking guide. Simply sign up for a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> subscription. This will ensure you have the very very latest in cutting edge computer science advancements right on your desktop, delivered straight to your door, and without the need to upgrade your PC. And the beauty of it is, you are helping America stay out of recession.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Isn't it true that using GNU/Linux will result in a cooler CPU, less energy usage, and a longer computer life?  As a matter of fact, it IS true, but since this site is extremely biased against GNU/Linux, I'll probably get moderated down for saying this.  But I challenge anybody to prove me wrong.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time, a system's CPU is running at between 2% and 20% of maximum capacity.  Some CPU-intensive activities such as heavy number crunching, complex rendering, IDE disk access, loading large applications, etc., can cause the CPU usage to spike to 100%, but during a day of typical use, the CPU should average AT MOST 30% of maximum usage, with 10% being a more common average.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the interesting thing about CPUs is that normally, when they have nothing to do (70% or more of each second will be spent doing nothing), they continue spinning around aimlessly, generating heat, and consuming electricity.  Thus, a completely idle computer system is using just as much CPU electricity and the CPU is working just as hard as an identical system doing rendering for Toy Story 3.  The latter system will be using electricity for hard drive access, but that's a different issue.<BR>
<BR>
Now, Intel introduced a helpful CPU instruction called HLT.  Each CPU cycle (a 1GHz system has 1 billion cycles per second, at least 70% of which are usually wasted because the system has nothing to do) consists of one instruction being executed.  If a HLT instruction is executed during a CPU cycle, the CPU will actually shut itself off for the duration of that cycle.<BR>
<BR>
It's possible for a computer operating system to issue a HLT instruction on every CPU cycle that would otherwise have been wasted.  If a 1GHz CPU was running at 10% of capacity, 900,000,000 HLTs would be issued per second, causing the CPU to use 10% as much electricty, do 10% as much work, release 10% as much heat, and greatly extending the life of the CPU.<BR>
<BR>
Linux does this.  Windows does NOT.  A HLT thread has been shown to lower a CPU's temperature by up to 30 degrees C, and a Linux system's CPU will generally be up to 30 degrees cooler than an identical machine running Windows.<BR>
<BR>
I know you're going to say "that's Communist and evil," but it looks like the "Communists" actually managed to out-fox the Capitalists this time.  Suck on those lemons.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I have had the misfortune to visit the UK on several occasions on business, and I have to say things have changed a lot over there in recent years. There is a starbucks on every corner. There are homeless people sitting on the streets begging. The UK shows all the signs of becoming almost as capitalist as the USA.

Of course, they have some work to do, (they need to get rid of the free healthcare for example) but on the whole I found London to be reasonably tolerable.<BR><BR>
Of course, some things have not changed at all. Their dental hygiene is appaling, as is their plumbing, and British automobiles still suck (and leak oil all over the place). London seems to have solved its fog problem (which was particularly bad earlier in the century).

An American can visit the UK and feel at home.

The Linuxer who started this thread was just spouting propoganda: all enterprise-grade operating systems, namely Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP, feature idle HLT threads, as well as some toy operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and the Sony Playstation.<BR>
<BR>
It's true that the Windows 9x line doesn't use a HLT thread, but this is actually intentional on Microsoft's part.  Unlike the Sociocommunist Linux philosophy, which spouts "everyone should get the same quality software, no matter how much they pay for it," Microsoft practices sound consumer principles like "you get what you pay for."  The Windows 9x line is intentionally degraded in many ways to ensure that those customers who pay the additional fee for the Windows NT line receive a product that's greatly superior to the lower-priced offerings.  The degraded Win9x line is available for low-end users with limited resources who therefore don't deserve top quality, such as low-income families, charitable organizations, and people on minimum wage (namely GNU programmers).  These people can not pay as much as businesses and more affluent individuals, therefore it would be unfair to the people who CAN pay to give the poor people the same level of quality as the well-to-do.<BR>

You mentioned Debian GNU/Linux, and that's one of my biggest peeves with the Lignux crowd: Debian has to be the most useless and Communistic of all the Freeware operating systems extant.  Debian was originally created by the GNU/Linux principal developer Richard Stallman, who as I've already discussed in other threads is a self-avowed "democratic socialist," or if we're to use terms that more closely reflect reality, "Communist."  Debian was the official distribution of the Freeware Software Foundation for a number of years, which should give you a preview of what Debian users might be like: dogmatic, filled with vitriol, and unquestionably intolerant of others.  Technically, the distribution is a failure:  it has no manual and hence is used mainly by self-proclaimed "leet hackers", it doesn't follow the official and superior "RPM" package management system (meaning that programs must be compiled by hand, requring fairly advanced programming skills and a lot of luck), the the distro is unwieldingly huge, filled with nearly 10,000 different useless Freeware programs.<BR>
<BR>
In short, although Debian fits the mold perfectly for insecure, immature hacker-types sitting in front of a computer in their parents' basement in cheeto-stained underwear, it's an even further step backward in terms of real-world usability than the other freeware Lignux operating systems.<BR><br><br>--

"I notice that you didn't bother to comment on the bit about RPM and it's "official and superior" nature. Could this be because it's neither?"
<br><br>
The Linux Standards Base lists RPM as the interim official package format.  If you want to interpret the LSB's statement a different way, that's your right.  But you'll be wrong.
<br><br>
Look at the market share of Redhat versus the market share of Debian, and I think you'll see what package format is superior.
<br><br>
Not that any Linux package management is "superior."  Microsoft brought us the world's first TRUE advanced package management system with <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">Windows Update </a>and the Windows Installer.  it works a lot better than any of the Linux offerings, too.
<br><br>
"Could it be that Ian Murdock is listed as the creator of Debian, because it's the truth? I hope that we can atleast agree that it is named after he and his wife Debra. Coincidence, hmm?"
<br><br>
I won't deny that, but can YOU deny that Debian was once the official OS of the Free Software Foundation?  Your own Debian history page says that.
<br><br>
"Could it be that Free software is such a good thing that even Microsoft use it for thier HotMail service?"
<br><br>
That's an absolute lie.  Microsoft BOUGHT Hotmail which was using UNIX OS's at the time, but quickly upgraded it to the enterprise-grade Windows NT over the past couple of years.  You posted statistics for "ad.law3.hotmail.com", but that's NOT Hotmail.  Hotmail is "www.hotmail.com", which <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph/?host=www.hotmail.com">is running Windows 2000 and IIS</a>.
<br><br>
Some of the back-end servers like the one you listed may still be running legacy OS's, but it's impossible to upgrade thousands of servers in less than a year's time while still keeping the high-volume Hotmail service up and running the entire time.  The fact that you probably searched through HUNDREDS of servers to find one still running a UNIX OS just proves that Linux users will do ANYTHING to make Microsoft look bad, but it's usually just themselves who wind up looking bad.
<br><br>
"Could it be that you are confusing Slashdot's obsession with petrified models with some sort of free operating system?"
<br><br>
Could you rephrase your question in the form of a question that makes sense?
<br><br>
"Could it be that you complain about the thousands of freeware programs included with Debian because you've been brainwashed."
<br><br>
Freeware software is free because it's not good enough to pay money for.  If Debian were good enough for people to buy it, it wouldn't be free.  Debian tried to sell a retail box (they even gave away a free Loki game with it), but, wonders of wonders, <b>nobody bought it</b>!

So you go and check my comment history on other stories to try to "dig up dirt" about me?  That's mature.  And I don't "wax poetic."  I "rant like a drunken sailor."  <b>Please don't confuse the two.</b>
<br><br>
RPM is the official packaging format, and Debian does not use RPM.  Is there something I'm missing?  Debian is not in compliance with the official standard.  The only distribution LESS in compliance is Slackware, which is boycotting the entire LSB.

Even a Communist has to admit that in the <b>real world</b>, one of the ways to measure the success of an operating system is by the number of people who using it, right?  The better it is, the more people will use it, right?
<br><br>
Why, then, is Linux use at 0.5% of all PC usage, and why is Debian usage at 5% of all Linux usage.  Check the statistics yourself if you don't believe me.
<br><br>
<i><blockquote>Actually all of the servers at hotmail that actually house any email are still FreeBSD because Win2k couldn't keep up.. and sorry, that was the first one I tried.</blockquote></i>

So you <b>at random</b> decided to guess that a machine called "ad.law3.hotmail.com" existed, and, wonder of wonders, it happend to be running a Freeware OS?
<br><br>
Wonder of wonders.
<br><br>
More likely, you read a +5 rated comment on Slashdot saying "I found one Hotmail server still running UNIX!  I am so leet!"   Wonder of wonders.
<br><br>
At least a year ago, Microsoft issued an official response to the allegations that Hotmail servers ran UNIX operating systems, but I guess you can't be bothered to research the facts.
<br><br>
<i><blockquote>Microsoft paid (a pretty penny to) for FreeBSD servers, kinda ironic.</blockquote></i>

No, Microsoft bought <b>Hotmail</b> and all the servers it was currently running on.  They bought it because they wanted to modernize it and turn it into a productive service.  The OS the servers were running was one unfortunate aspect of the foetal Hotmail, which Microsoft quickly set about correcting.
<br><br>
Microsoft didn't <b>want</b> the FreeBSD servers, it wanted Hotmail, which just happened to be running on UNIX boxes at the time because the original owner could not afford high-end hardware and high-end OS's.  And Microsoft only paid money for the hardware itself and for the proprietary Hotmail software, they paid <b>nothing</b> for the hunderds of copies of FreeBSD.
<br><br>
So much for "buying free software"!
<br><br>
<i><blockquote>la la la... it must be nice to live in fantasy land... where nobody buys free software.</blockquote></i>

Yes, freeware sales are doing <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LNUX&d=t">very well</a>.  They look like a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=BLPT.OB&d=t">great investments</a>.

Microsoft BOUGHT Hotmail which was using UNIX OS's at the time, but quickly upgraded it to the enterprise-grade Windows NT over the past couple of years.

<BR>
Yet they continued to use them for quite sometimes until they were found out.  Also Hotmail was not using Unix OSs.  Examples of these would be Hewlett-Packards HP-UX or IBM's AIX.  I believe it should have read Unix-like OSs.  For your information the hotmail servers in question ran FreeBSD.<BR>
<BR>
Also if open-source, freely distrinutable, "communist code" is such crap to that founf in Windows was does MS used code from FreeBSD in its TCP/IP stack? You can read the BSD license to find that it's perfectly OK to use BSD licensed code however you want as long as you give credit to those who actually did the work.<BR>
<BR>
Don't even get me started on the fact that TCP/IP was a protocol developed for UNIX by researchers at the University of Claifornia at Berkeley and NOT a MS innovation.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The Open Unices, (I hate to use the term 'Free' as it is ambiguous, and usually construed as 'Free as in beer', as opposed to 'Free as in speach') came about as the result of a need for Unix on the Intel x86 platform.  This is due to the fact that not everyone can/could afford the expensive hardware (PDP-7/11, Vax, Honeywell, 360/370, et cetera) required to run commercial Unices.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

However, you seem to have failed to realize the true potential of underclocking. What harms your CPU is heat, which is tied to power consumption, but also external factors. Let's start with the power consumption.
<BR><BR>
Now, power consumption varies linearly with clock speed; halving the frequency will, approximately, halv power consumption. So far so good.
<BR><BR>
The true savings, however, comes from lowering the supply voltage to the CPU. Power varies by the square of the supply voltage. Lowering the voltage will make the transistors slower. But, <i>and this is the real kicker</i>, if you are already underclocking, the transistors are operating faster than they need! On a good motherboard you can change the supply voltage in BIOS. <b>By lowering the supply voltage, you'll achieve cubic reductions in power consumption!</b>
This is how expensive low-power CPUs already work, but you can do the same with your regular desktop CPU.
<BR><BR>
Some additional power efficiency and lifespan improvement tips:
<ul>
<li>To save power; instead of using case fans, simply leave the case open.
<li>To maximize lifespan, keep the temperature down; preferrably, put the motherboard in the freezer instead of in a computer chassis, or use liquid cooling.
<li>RAM memory also consumes power, don't put in more than you'll need. If you're getting a new computer, remember that DDR memory consumes less power than regular SDRAM or Rambus.
<li>Turn down the brightness of your screen, and buy a 15" or smaller. If you're a good typist, switch off the screen while working.
<li>Buy a Pentium III, not a Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon, as they have more transistors and therefore consume more power.
<li>Save your work less often. This will allow your harddrive to spin down while you are working, saving another 5 Watts.
<li>If you don't like the freezer thing, at least turn down the heat in your apartment; this will keep your computer running cool.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First of all, I saw nothing on the DMCA page about overclocking. Yes, it is illegal for resellers to overclock a chip and falsely present it as a higher-speed unit, but it is totally legal for end-users to do so if they wish.
<BR><BR>
Second, the part about 2 MHz increase removing 6 months of life? Absolute bullshit. 
<br>
1) you can't overclock any CPU *just* 2 MHz. That would be 0.2% on a 1 GHz CPU. Overclocking raises a chip's speed by at least 33 or 50 MHz at a time, often 100 or more. The most famous overclockable chip of all time-- the 300 MHz Celeron A-- shipped at 300 MHz and ran fine at 450. 
<br>
2) Do you understand overclocking at all? Here's WHY it works: most chips are capable of running faster than the speed at which they are shipped. When Intel wants to make a batch of, say 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 GHz, they make a bunch of chips and see how fast they run. If a chip runs fine at 1.3 GHz but produces errors at 1.4, it is sold as a 1.4. However, chipmakers are getting too good. If Intel wanted to make 50% 1.3s, 30% 1.4s, and 20% 1.5s (to keep supply low, and prices high, for the higher-end units; remember, because of how they're made, they all cost the same to make), but they wind up with 60% of their chips able to run at 1.5, they just take these perfectly good 1.5s and sell them as 1.3s or 1.4s. So, if Intel makes and successfully tests a 1.5 GHz chip, sells it as a 1.3, and the buyer runs it at 1.5, is he causing undue damage to the chip? In a word, no.
<BR><BR>
Besides, you fail to recognize one little thing: REALITY. If chips are so delicate and overclocking is so damaging, why is it done so much, so often, and so successfully? Because chips are not that delicate and overclocking is not that damaging. You can argue all you want that the sun is not hot but, in fact, cold, but if you step outside and it's warm, then you're wrong.
<BR><BR>
Also, very few computers have CPU multipliers in the BIOS. Most are set with jumpers on the motherboard. Also, you completely ignored the other half of the CPU speed equation. Why do they call it a multiplier? Because you're multiplying your bus speed! Have you dropped your Dell from a 100 MHz FSB to 66, or 60, or 50, or 33?
<BR><BR>
If you really want to save the world then sell your CRT and buy a flat panel display. I traded a 20" CRT (which would make my room 10-15 degrees warmer in a few hours) for an 18.1" flat panel and I can leave on all day and add nearly nothing to the room's temp. Just don't let that CRT go into a landfill-- they're half lead by weight.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No, they dont do this. That would be stupid. What they do when the yields go up is <strong>reduce the price of the faster chip</strong>. You clearly understand nothing about the CPU market.<BR><BR>
As for overclocking being 'safe' - well you cannot just go into the bios and up the clock speed. You have to remove the pathetic excuse for thermal compound that AMD supply, replace it with some real stuff, make sure you have adequate cooling, and even then you are still taking the chance that the chip you have is one of those that will actually run faster.<BR><BR>
Believe it or not, Intel and AMD give their processors a speed rating to HELP the consumer, not to rip them off.<BR><BR>
Let me guess. You are a <a href="http://www.plastic.com">slashdot</a> reader, aren't you ? I can spot your type a mile off - hiding behind the cloak of anonymity, the ill-informed technical "knowledge", the insulting language of a 14-year old, the self-righteous whining, coupled with an astonishing ignorance of the facts. Perhaps you should stay away from the Internet's most controversial site if you cannot handle controversy in a mature fashion. Leave adequacy to the grown-ups, and run along to your slashdot playpen, junior.

There are <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/opt/oc/risksRisksCPU-c.html">well known dangers associated with overclocking</a>. How harmful it is varies from chip to chip, but a rule of thumb is that a 10 degree (centigrade) temperature increase of the chip surface <a href="http://www.chillblast.com/guides/core.htm">will halve the lifetime of your cpu</a>.
<BR><BR>
Now, my own Intel Celeron CPU gets 10 degrees hotter if I overclock from its original 500, to 550 MHz (given the same cooling). Expected lifetime of a regular desktop CPU is <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/english/99/10/210/">no more than 15 years</a>. Therefore, those 50MHz will cost me about 7.5 years of usage. If the decrease in lifetime was linear with frequency, 2MHz would mean 3.6 months in my case. Unfortunately, it is not that simple; decrease in lifetime is actually exponentially related to frequency increase. Still, the author's approximation is not that bad, and could actually be true for some chips.
<BR><BR>
Furthermore, your whole rant has no bearing on the validity of the article. Even if a processor is <i>able</i> to run faster, it will <i>still</i> consume more power, and have a shorter lifetime (unless you improve cooling) than the same chip running at a lower speed. If you underclock, the chip should work for longer than the nominal 15 years.
<BR><BR>
Oh, and finally, all <a href="http://www.abit.com.tw">good motherboards</a> have all important settings in BIOS, not on jumpers; and they allow you to change bus settings in 1 MHz increments.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Fans are useful in mechanical equipment, because the heat generated internally by friction can build up and warp the metal due to uneven expansion.  But a computer is, by definition, an electronic device.  It has no moving parts, therefore there is no friction, therefore it generates no heat.  In any case, fans cool you down by the evaporation of sweat and since microchips don't sweat, it wouldn't do any good as a cooling device anyway.  Is there any way in which one can remove the fan from a computer?

Not true, otherwise how would electricity pass around the circuit? Everyone knows that electricity is due to the flow of electrons, but what they don't teach you in A-level physics is that the metal tracks which connect transistors on the chip also move. <BR><BR>
It's due to the law of conservation of momentum - because the negatively charged electrons move against the direction of electric fields in the chip, the positively charged metal ions have to move in the opposite direction (or else your humble PC would be a perpetual motion machine).<BR><BR>
Over time, all the interconnecting metal tracks will start trying to escape from the processor chip by leaking out into the silicon, as <a href="http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/mkg/image/em2.jpg">this picture</a> shows.

Normally, they move very slowly. Since electrons move at only a few centimtres per minute and are considerably lighter than metal ions, the law of conservation of momentum implies that the metal moves even more slowly.<BR><BR>
The real danger is that the metal is contained within the chip's casing, which starts to become pressurised as the amount of escaping metal increases. Eventually, the chip becomes so pressurised that it may explode with enough force to <a href="http://www.controlled-demolition.co.uk../../images/demo3.jpg">destroy a whole block of flats!</a>.<BR><BR> <i>What happens if I cut a hole in a chip by mistake? Do you get leaky chips? It is all very complicated.</i><BR><BR>
This is actually the best way to eliminate the risk of potentially fatal CPU explosions. By letting excess metal inside the chip gently drain away through carefully drilled holes in its casing, there is no danger of the chip becoming over-pressure and exploding. A standard Black and Decker hammer action drill should be sufficient for drilling your chip.<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

You are SO right.  Of the 7 major Universities that were primarily using UNIX systems in 1995, 5 of them are still primarily UNIX shops today!  Wow, that's impressive!  I wonder what's going on with the ~5000 major Universities that HAVE migrated to Enterprise-grade Microsoft technologies.<BR>

Wait a second -- when did stability and security become the same issue?  I'll just address security at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
More Windows machines get hacked for two reasons:<BR>
<BR>
1.  More Windows machines exist.<BR>
2.  Most hackers and other high-tech criminals use UNIX OS's out of terminal jealousy towards Microsoft and will willfully engage in any criminal act to make Microsoft look bad.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft products actually have one of the best track records when it comes to security.   Of course, any system is only as secure as its administrator.  On server systems, any system maintained by a good administrator will be secure, and one that isn't won't.  On home systems, however, Microsoft Windows definitely wins out in terms of security:  Linux includes hundreds of "services" that allows hackers to enter the computer over the Internet, while (the home versions of) Windows includes no "services," thus it's 100% impossible for an attacker to get into the machine over the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
"Why is it that 80% of the web servers run UNIX and a majority of the remaning servers run Apache, Linux, FreeBSD or NetBSD? Why not run Windows?"<BR>
<BR>
You're making up statistics.  While it's true that 45% of web servers run a Microsoft OS and 50% of web servers run a UNIX OS (which INCLUDES Linux and all of the BSDs), that's only because the statistics include web servers in college dorm rooms that serve nothing but pornography and MP3s to other systems in the dorm.  If you exclude those, Windows has a slight advantage.<BR>
<BR>
And Apache is NOT an operating system, it's an HTTP program.  Moron.<BR>
<BR>
"Why is that whenever MS comes out with a NEW INNOVATIVE feature nobody seems to remember the other companies that have been doing it for the last 5-10 years?"<BR>
<BR>
Can you give ONE real example of this, or are you just FUDing?<BR><br><br>--
