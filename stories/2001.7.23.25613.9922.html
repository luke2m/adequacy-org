		<i>"Luv Yr Enemies" is an occasional adequacy.org series in which we attempt to rehabilitate the reputations of unpopular figures who are, when looked at in objective terms, in no way the unremitting bastards which popular opinion would have you believe them to be.</i><p>

This episode:<p>

<b>Jesus of Nazareth: Not as <a href="http://www.godonthe.net/wasblack.htm">Black</a> as he's painted<p></b>

Obviously, Jesus Christ is an unpopular figure for us to be defending, as the <a href="http://www.lronhubbard.org/">chief executive</a> of a murderous cult with a <a href="http://www.jpfo.org/wolfe-blackbook.htm">Black Book</a> every bit as <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/">thick</a> as those of <a href="http://www.linux.org">Communism</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Fascism</a>.  However, controversy is the <i><a href="http://www.eneva.com/teach-yourself-french.html">raison d'etre</a></i> of <a href="../index.html">adequacy.org</a>, so into the lists we go.  Our cause is right, so defend him, we might.        </div>    </td>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Obviously, the easiest way to defend Mr. Christ would be to claim that the vast majority of the murders, lootings, genocides and similar acts of pure, unadulterated <a href="http://www.cliffrichard.org/">evil</a> attributable to his organisation actually occurred long after his <a href="http://www.happy-easter.com/">death</a>, and were carried out by less scrupulously moral underlings.  However, this version of the "<a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/6235/politic.htm">Lenin Good/Stalin Bad</a>" defence, popular with communist apologists of a certain age, is hardly open to Mr Christ.  If he's telling the truth in his <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible">bestselling book</a> (and its <a href="http://www.jefflindsay.com/BOMIntro.shtml">bestselling sequel</a>), then he has been, personally, in charge of the whole <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6302581907/">shebang</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/02/07/n.ireland.02/">shooting match</a> for the last two thousand years.  If he did in fact die in 33AD, then he's a fucking liar for saying he wasn't going to, and why are we bothering talking about him?  I dunno.<p>

So it's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/">pleas in mitigation</a> that we're looking for, then ,given that Adequacy.org is not in the habit of denying <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/i/irving-david/">obvious historical facts</a> <b>[Editor's note, by elby: this is not official policy -- we may very well choose to deny <a href="http://spiralx.dyndns.org/texts/troll11.html">historical facts</a> in the future]</b>.  Although we have to accept a history of <a href="http://www.magicmakers.com/retail/costumes/XTCleather/sexynun.html">sexism</a>, <a href="http://www.churchnet.org.uk/news/files4/gay-vicars.html">homophobia</a>, <a href="http://www.knight.org/advent/cathen/04543c.htm">genocide</a>, <a href="http://www.jypark.com/france/paris1/sights02.htm">dodgy taste in architecture</a> and reasonably laid charges of being an out-and-out <a href="http://halife.com/church/funthings.html">bore</a>, we would put it to you, the reader, that the Jesus Christ <a href="http://www.godshiphop.com/">rap</a> sheet, forbidding though it is, can be divided up into four major categories:<ul>

<li>Crimes committed against people who, basically, had it coming (<a href="http://www.americanwicca.com/">witches</a>, heretics, choirboys) -- as that guy at <a href="http://www.byington.org/Carl/ruby/ruby1.htm">Ruby Ridge</a> found out, if you go out of your way to piss off The Man, sooner or later, you have to expect a reaction.
<li>Crimes against individuals and races of dubious historical provenance (Joan of Arc, <a href="http://spiralx.dyndns.org/texts/troll11.html">Native Americans</a>, the "<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/burn_awd.htm">burning times</a> victims) -- it doesn't matter how horrible you are to somebody if they never actually existed.
<li>Acts which, while morally questionable, are undoubtedly protected by the United States Constitution (<a href="http://www.users.qwest.net/~willie64/firstamendment.html">homophobia</a>, sexism, buggery of choirboys)<p>and<p>
<li>Crimes which, though hideous in themselves, were the inevitable byproducts of the production of things generally acknowledged to be good (Catholic guilt, <a href="http://www.evemag.com/issue5/spears.html">Catholic schoolgirls</a>, basically everything to do with the Catholics)</ul>

So, given that the <a href="http://www.theeunderground.net/Features/features166semen.shtml">objective evidence</a> seems to detail that Christ's manifold crimes never happened, happened to Bad People and/or had <a href="http://www.allcelebrities.net/Britney/">good consequences</a>, why the hell are people all over <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/tim.i/mc30ad.htm">Jesus Christ</a>?  After all, Christian believers are <a href="http://www.charitywave.com/donations.asp?charity=nccj">nicer</a> than the average person, more <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~Joseph_Provencial/caip_homepage.htm">moral</a>, more <a href="http://witnesses.about.com/library/weekly/aa022399.htm">interesting</a> and even <a href="http://www.l-c-f.org.uk/christian_sexuality.htm">better in bed</a>.  <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> investigated this matter, and found out that the one serious objection to Christians, which accounts for the entirety of the <a href="http://www.infidels.org/activist/current/">hysterical</a> <a href="http://www.au.org/">politicised</a> <a href="http://members.aol.com/skepticweb/church.html">opposition</a> to this otherwise <a href="http://www.neopagan.net/ReligiousReich.HTML">harmless</a> and <a href="http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws93/church40.html">beneficial</a> <a href="http://www.vbe.com/~tdg/kjv/study/historical.html">historical</a> figure?<p>

What is this incredibly important political issue, which warrants such hysterical rhetoric?<P>

<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10c3.htm">Christians want to hang the Ten Commandments on the wall in schools</a>.<p>

He also hated the free market economy - look at that disgraceful affair where he knocked up market tables.<BR><BR>
He consorted with a prostitute and other degenerates. He encouraged people to think beyond their station in life, creating strife and social problems.<BR><BR>
Look at the history of the last 2000 years. How many people killed by Jesus and his henchmen? Countless millions. The idea of a God who would do this is absurd and primitive, we are much better of abandoning the whole idiotic idea.<BR><BR>
But for what? Allah and other Gods are even worse. The best idea is to embrace science, which nowadays has all the answers, spiritual and otherwise. Why teach about the Garden of Eden when you have the Big Bang and evolution? Why teach the ten commandments and such ethics when you have the precise mathematics of Game Theory and zero sum games?<BR><BR>

<br><br>
You should not take a "free & easy" attitude towards sex--it was an honor given to humans by the minor god <i>Drateru</i> (of the boundless ceremony).  As is clearly outlined in the text, sex should <i>only</i> take place before a group of elders during the holy month of <i>Shimadh</i>, and <i>under no circumstances</i> are those chosen to partake in this ceremony to use any instrument of non-human origin.  
<br><br>
As per the text:
<blockquote>
<i>
...and with such an act, the demon stole Drateru's seed, and she could not be trusted to survive the followers.  With shame, Drateru did then pluck the hairs from her crusted body, spreading them about the ground as a mark of her transgression.  And she did lament, "The face of demonic temptation did surely inject an evil, and my weakness must not be forgiven."
</i>
</blockquote>
To think of sex without first performing the ceremony of Djnisku (where the elders pluck each hair from the chosen's body, to remind us of Drateru's own weakness), much less to think of sex with inhuman devices, is sure to invite the demons once again.
<br><br>
And yes, it is people such as yourself--who have bastardized the word and the faith, who have cast off this sacred gift, who have given up the ceremony--that open the doors for all <a href="http://geocities.com/esr_babylove/">demons to burrow through the wombs of the faithful</a>.<BR><br>c'mon, lower.<BR></FONT></td>

The shimmer of the chemicals against her clear skin is enough to turn the most ardent religious supporter into a die-hard scientific believer.  Many a evening in college, when the other chaps would go and try to woo the girls of this-or-that sorority, I would sneak away alone to the chemistry labs, to gaze in adoration, and even bond with, the multitude of beakers that waited for me there.
<br><br>
And, oh, what a beautiful group they were too,  In all different shapes, sizes, and measurements.  There were so many experiments to be performed with them, so many chemicals they could be used to hold.  I knew each and every one of them by name, and oh, how they longed for me when I entered the lab.  Oh, how they loved me in a way that no human possibly could.  Often, the sheer ecstasy we experienced over the course of the night was far more than I could bear, and after some of the more passionate of the excursions I was known to go home and sleep for days.  But I always knew when the chem lab was to be deserted, and I always woke up in time to go back.

<br><br>
I certainly don't disagree with your usage of the term 'drivel', here, but what in God's name makes Kant an acceptable example of the application of logic to morals?  I understand that he is an example of applying science to morals very, very poorly, but I fail to see how that implies it can not be done!  What about those like Spinoza and Descartes, who, although they had faith, attempted to derive a moral systems based primarily on logic?  What about the French existentialists, like Sartre and Camus, who proposed systems of ethics totally devoid of any controlling power at all?  And those are just a few of my favorites -- surely you realize there are hundreds of ethical systems independant of gods or goddesses that make more sense than <i>Kant's</i>.<BR><br><BR></FONT></td>

Why is religion any better at working out 'why?' than science? Science may not address 'why?' because science recognises that the question is impossible to answer. Religion is a fraud. Asking 'Why?' is fine, and is the proper remit of philosophy. As soon as you start to come up with concrete answers, you're a charlatan. Religion is just organised lies.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>Game theory may give you a good idea about the consequences of certain actions in various situations, but it doesn't do anything to define which consequences would be best.</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
Again, a difficult question and one science does not address. Religion is no good for this either though, for similar reasons. This is a question of common morality and the philosophy of Ethics.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>Science contradicts itself every day and is constantly changing. The fundamental ethics of the Christian church, in its various incarnations, have remained the same for thousands of years.</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
That science changes is its greatest strength, for it means it has humility, self criticism and scepticism. Why is religion better because it is incapable of changing and adapting to new times? Religion lacks criticism and insight, is what you are saying. Religion doesn't <em>get better</em> over time.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>Hell, something as fundamental as the Earth's rotation around the sun was discounted by scientific people for centuries, and you trust these people with your very soul?</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
Soul? Who's to say I have a soul? Besides, you are obviously trolling - you know fine well that religion tried to stamp out this particular heresy.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>Without meaning, all of our actions are worthless, and all the pain, suffering, joy, and hope you experience in your lifetime is nothing more than twitches.</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
Meaning is something I personally approach without recourse to organised religion. It is also something impossible to be sure of. Meaning isn't for everyone.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>The fact that countries with a state church (such as the UK) are much more forgiving, kind, and liberal with their people than countries who embrace de facto atheism (such as the US) is no coincidence.</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
The UK is quite possibly the most secular society on Earth. With a 5% churchgoing population (precipitously declining), it is certainly one of the kinder and more liberal countries, because it has thrown off the shackles & prejudices of religion.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><i>This is, quite simply, the only way to go. Without some form of spirituality in our daily lives, we may very well cease to be men and turn to monsters...</i></blockquote><BR><BR>
What exactly is `spirituality`? Please define, it sounds very vague.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Don't put words in my mouth. Maybe there is more to the universe. Maybe there isn't. We can't <em>know</em>, at this stage, and thats the end of it. Your attempts to use religious propaganda and false logic expose you as a religious maniac, blinded to rational thought. There is no point in arguing with someone like you, because you are so lost in masturbatory self delusion that you can't <em>see</em>, see the realm of human enquiry for what it is.<BR><BR>

Prove this 'something' exists.<BR><BR>

Clearly you are lost in `spiritual` rapture. It is people like you that commit mass suicide because the aliens are riding to Earth on the back of a comet. Quite frankly, my dear, I suspect you of some form of mental illness. Schizophrenics and paranoid delusionals are often pagans, because multiple voices in your head is similar to multiple gods, and lets face it, pagans are the biggest gulls out there.<BR><BR>
Presumably you have the occasional manic episode and think this is a spiritual experience, or perhaps you take strange mind altering drugs and think you have seen the face of God. Whatever it is, you aren't quite all there, are you?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Using just logic and emperical evidence, there is only a certain minute amount of information one may ever gain about the universe. Other methods if acheiving information about the universe do exist, however, and have been around for much longer, and with much more success, than those the atheist triumphs. See, the atheistic plan of ignoring everything not arrived at via their method of gaining information, attempting to discredit it, and even going so far as to curse the very scientists who follow their methods should they be willing to accept something outside of the atheists's allmighty Church of Reason. (One need only witness the mockery put upon scientists who are religious.)<BR><BR>Then, at the very height of duplicity, the Atheist even will not even accept that their holy methods of deduction have been used to prove the existance of God.

If your world works in such a way that something is real because you imagine it to be real, you are welcome to whatever gods you choose.

No, he's just saying that he ACCEPTS this. Perhaps you suffer from the delusion that there is a greater purpose to life, or that everything has to have a meaning? This is just YOUR opinion.

To suggest someone is a "sociopath" because of this common belief is incredibly narrow-minded.

I think it's funny how some people use the word "godless" as if it has some really cold, unpleasant connotations. I'm quite happy with my own godless existence, but I still hold the view that I am one very small fish in a huge sea.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Why can't you accept life at face value?

<BR>
I'm not saying you are wrong for asking "why". (If the supposed answers that your religion offers you enrich your life, then good luck to you.) What I'm saying is that you are wrong to criticise someone for NOT asking "why". In many ways this is the difference a theist and an atheist. I assure you - it's not because we're afraid of the answer! And it's not because we can't be bothered asking!
<BR>

<BR>
In some senses you could say that:
<BR>
Agnosticism = accepting that we can't answer why
<BR>
Atheism = accepting that you don't need to ask why
