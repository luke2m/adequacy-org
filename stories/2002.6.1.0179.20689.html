		It is a certainty today that any journalist, co-worker or friend who uses the word "<a href="http://www.lakesidepress.com/Golf/Preface.htm">hacker</a>" to describe a computer criminal will be ritualisticly hectored by dogmatic computer enthusiasts with tedious stories of the allegedly benign origins of the word "<a href="http://www.badgolfmonthly.com/">hacker</a>."  Sometimes these origins are ascribed to the MIT railroad club of the 1950s, and sometimes they are placed earlier, in the engineering side of the American industrial home front of World War II.  Regardless of historical location, the mythology so presented is consistent in its insistence that the word was wholly positive in every aspect, devoid of any negative connotation whatsoever.   By the early 1980s, however, the word was being used <i>by computer enthusiasts</i> to describe the criminal element in their midst, a usage that the press picked up as computers spread into the home and the public consciousness.  How did this apparent change come about?  The answer, I believe, lies in the game of <a href="http://www.golfweb.com/">golf</a>.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">In all the tales of the early use of the word "<a href="http://www.badgolfmonthly.com/askhacker.htm">hacker</a>" to describe clever or unconventional engineering, a most salient detail is always left out:  why on earth was the word "<a href="http://www.hackware.com/">hack</a>" chosen to describe this sort of tinkering?  On the face of it, the word seems to mean quite the opposite of the activity it is supposed to describe; it denotes rending asunder rather than assembling odd parts into a new whole.
<p>
In the culture surrounding the game of golf, however, the applicability of the word "<a href="http://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,44,FF.html">hacker</a>" is immediately apparent.  The term is used to describe an amateur player of mediocre skill but great enthusiasm.  In golf, the choice of the word "<a href="http://sportsdays.co.uk/golf/">hacker</a>" is obvious, as the word instantly brings to mind an image of a man chopping away at the turf with a club in an effort to move the ball down the fairway.  There is no mystery here, as there is when the word is used to describe a grown man playing with model railroads.
<p>
In golf culture, the word "<a href="http://www.ausgolf.com.au/hacker/">hacker</a>" is neither wholly good nor wholly bad in its connotations.  On the one hand, it is used in a positive manner, implying affection for those who, though lacking talent or training, nonetheless manage to eventually land the ball in the cup.  On the other hand, it is used negatively, to suggest that the person so described lacks the initiative to improve his game, or the consideration to replace the divots thrown up by all of that energetic flailing, thus leaving the course a mess for the next foursome.
<p>
The next piece of our puzzle comes from the history of computers, but it is a point often overlooked or conveniently omitted by those who seek to place strict language controls on the meaning and usage of the word "<a href="http://www.golfweek.com/articles/1999/features/reviews/books/2464.asp">hacker</a>."  The piece of history in question is the fact that early computers were not constructed by undergraduates and amateur technology enthusiasts (in those days, these people would have been ham radio operators, or some such), but rather by highly trained, disciplined scientists and engineers with strict project requirements, accountable to budgetary oversight of the universities or government agencies in which they worked.  
<p>
If these scientists and engineers had been caught using their allotted grants, time, and equipment to do something so frivolous as play space-fantasy games, they would have found their funding cut off in an instant, and all hopes of tenure dashed.  These people would not have called themselves "<a href="http://www.prosnhackers.bigstep.com/catalog.html">hackers</a>," as is implicitly confirmed by the very origin-myths advanced by modern-day computer enthusiasts, which always describe computers "becoming available to" or "arriving in" communities where the term had acquired its new technological meaning.
<p>
We must step back, now, and ask again: why on earth was the word "<a href="http://www.zackcompany.com/hackerpr.htm">hacker</a>" chosen to describe unconventional, amateur, and enthusiastic applications of technology?  Whether this happened in an industrial WWII setting or an academic 1950s setting, it seems an inescapable conclusion that the term was borrowed from the golf culture.
<p>
During the war, golf was on the rise in the United States, in the process of transformation from a rich man's game to an everyman's game.  At the same time, science and particularly engineering were developing into avenues whereby a poor man might become a moderately rich man.  Golf and engineering were well suited to one another, and borrowing of terminology would have been quite natural.
<p>
In the 1950s, golf in the US was in its heyday, a fully integrated part of everyday life.  Borrowing terms from the world of golf in this era would have been so widespread that it would have seemed odd if a given discipline <i>didn't</i> borrow language from the game.
<p>
In either scenario, the word would not have been appropriated to describe disciplined, knowledgeable, and responsible professionals and academics.  It would instead have been used to describe unskilled but enthusiastic amateurs- employees driven by the necessity of war, or students with access to equipment but unburdened by immediate goals or requirements for its use.
<p>
The first such usage was most likely affectionate, and therefor adopted by those it was applied to as well as their foremen or academic advisors.  The negative associations would have been imported from the world of golf as well, however, and so it would have been understood that someone described as a "<a href="http://golftips.freeyellow.com/jokes.html">hacker</a>" might not seek knowledge or training beyond that needed to get the job at hand done, and such a person might leave a bit of a mess behind, as well.  Since the people so described were mostly young, these faults would have been tolerated as youthful lapses rather than character flaws.
<p>
As time wore on, it became more and more clear that certain individuals did not outgrow the adolescent excesses of their technological tinkering, and so the negative implications of the word grew to greater significance.  At the same time, the study and use of computers was expanding and establishing a place in the academic and professional world, and with this establishment came new titles: <i>Programmer</i>, <i>Software Engineer</i>, and <i>Computer Scientist</i>.  People in positions of respect embraced these titles, distancing themselves from the word "<a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/showtell/story/0,24330,3371651,00.html">hacker</a>," and thus (perhaps unintentionally) accellerating the process of converting a somewhat benign term to a largely negative one.
<p>
By the early 1980s, this process was nearly complete.  So when the press first learned of computer crime, and interviewed professional programmers and computer scientists, these respected members of the computing world referred to the new crop of criminal-minded home-computing enthusiasts as mere "<a href="http://www.golfgiftshop.com/Store/about.asp">hackers</a>," implying marginal skill, lack of training, and total absence of the ethics present in respectable, established organizations and professions.
<p>
"<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/513/39603.html">Hacker</a>" meant "computer enthusiast" before it acquired its present meaning of "computer criminal."  It meant "amateur technologist" before it meant "computer enthusiast."  And it meant "amateur golfer" before it meant "amateur technologist."  Computer enthusiasts do not hold the first claim on the word.  Nor, I suspect, will they hold the last.
<p>
<a href="./2002.3.26.215.61646.html">Several</a> <a href="./2002.3.23.19835.2163.html">theories</a> have been advanced here at Adequacy to account for the persistence with which modern computer enthusiasts seek to whitewash the meaning and history of the word, and then take the laundered word to describe themselves.  The origins of the word in the culture of golf suggest a new motive.  Use of the word "<a href="http://archive.sportserver.com/generic/story/0,1673,38429-61918-449772-0,00.html">hacker</a>" creates and preserves an <i>expectation of mediocrity</i> in the listener.  The user, in this light, is maneuvering for a large handicap.
<p>
This particularly true when the audience is of a generation raised in the heyday of golf in America, a generation that happens to be at the head of most businesses and academic departments in that nation.  If a computer enthusiast manages to create and maintain low expectations, then he (for they are, statistically, male) is much less likely to be fired for writing brittle, inefficient, undocumented code, or using company time and resources to play video games.
<p>
Computer enthusiasts who are not explicitly aware of this causal chain certainly grasp it on a received cultural level.  Thus, we might expect that those with the lowest levels of technical skill, discipline, and professional ethic should be the most vociferous in their efforts to be referred to as "<a href="http://detnews.com/2001/golf/0108/17/g08e-269553.htm">hackers</a>."  
<p>
Does this prediction bear out?  Until the results of controlled psychological studies are available, we�ll just have to look around us, and judge for ourselves.

This "hack kneed" gait rendered the beast unsuitable as a mount, and thus doomed it to a life as a lowly draft animal.
<BR><BR>
It is worth noting, too, that the word "hacker," in the sense of "criminal," does not seem to have derived from the taxi-driver term "hackney," and may even have predated it.  Violent criminals (particularly highwaymen, it seems) were referred to as "hackers" contemporaneously, for the obvious bloody reasons.  This is covered in greater detail in the OED, if you need a reference.
<BR><BR>
By the time technology-enthusiasts adopted the term, the meanings above had fallen out of use in the US-- "hackney" had been supplanted by "cabbie," and while "hack" still referred to an incompetent in many fields (usually writing, though), "hacker" was used exclusively to describe amateur golfers.  This latter usage was the only proximate source available when the technologists adopted the term.<BR><BR><BR>

In the "old days" (and I can speak from personal experience about this), hacking meant quick-and-dirty modification of existing code, or if you will, "programming with an axe".<BR>
This is consistent with the usual meaning of the verb hack which is:<BR>
"to cut with repeated crude or ruthless blows".<BR>
As for how "hacking" came to be "cool", we old-timers remember the pre-hacker days of phone phreaking and Phrack magazine.<BR>
As phreaking became more computer-related, we have phrack --&gt; hack (also trading on the usual quick-and-dirty computer meaning of "hack" at the time).<BR>
Modern "sanitized" hackers are just trying to assume the "coolness" of the old-time phreakers.<BR>
P.S. - Incidentally, the use of "cracker" to describe a "black hat" hacker is ludicrous. Presumably they derived this from "safe cracker", but cracker normally means "white trash" as in the old slave saying:<BR>
"I have the cheese, now all I need is the cracker."<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I believe that the derivation is phrack=phreak+hack.<BR>
However, I contend that hacking (as in breaking into computers) is derived from its earlier (and sometimes current) use as in quick-and-dirty programming, which is in turn derived from hacking as "cutting with repeated crude or ruthless blows".<BR>
Your theory that computer hacking is derived from golf hacking is circuitous, and falls to Occam's razor.<BR>
You exaggerate the popularity of golf, as opposed to say bowling.<BR>
Anyway, it is more common to refer to an amateurish golfer as a "duffer" than a "hacker", so why isn't breaking into computers called duffing?<BR>
(Your definition of "hacker" as a "computer enthusiast" is historical revisionism, masking the "falling out of grace" of the phreakers, the fathers of the hackers.)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you think I'm overstating the social phenomenon of golf in the post-war US, then you're clearly unfamiliar with the period in question.  Do a bit of reading.  Post-war American culture is fascinating stuff.
<BR><BR>
Occam's Razor, I'm afraid, doesn't cut out intermediate meanings in etymology.
<BR><BR>
A "duffer" is an amateur golfer, yes, but a "duffer" is also a <i>lazy</i> (and often self-aware) amateur golfer.  A "hacker," on the other hand, is a particularly incompetent and <i>enthusiastic</i> amateur golfer.  "Hacker" is clearly the golf term better suited to describe amateur technology hobbyists.
<BR><BR>
Finally, it is a well established fact that amateur technology enthusiasts were using the word "hacker" <i>before</i> they started using computers, so your imagined genesis in an axe-metaphor applied to <i>programming</i>, in addition to being nonsensical, is provably untrue.

I am indeed taking this topic seriously.  There is a gaping hole in the history of the word "hacker" that modern computers-enthusiasts have been turning a blind eye to, and I think it is time to not only examine and fill that gap, but also explore their reasons for ignoring it.
<BR><BR>
The context of the quote is of course one of deceit, and in drawing attention to it I believe you are merely confessing to your own fabrication.  If you would instead accuse me or my study of deception, then you will have to put together an argument more convincing than allusive name-calling.
<BR><BR>
I think it would be more interesting to instead compare the Raymondite computer-enthusiast to Chaucer's Yeoman's Canon, thereby suggesting that these Orwellian language contortions are being perpetuated in the service of selling false alchemy.<BR><BR><BR>

Obviously "They" refers to the users of incomprehensible jargon (the alchemists). The modern day analogy is computer enthusiasts. So I'm basically saying that no one can "fully" understand the term "hacker".<BR>

I draw attention to the larger context of the Canon's Yeoman's tale to point out the fact that Chaucer was not, as you suggest, saying that the language of alchemists was inherently incomprehensible, but rather, he was suggesting that deliberately inscrutable nonsense was deployed by corrupt alchemists in an effort entirely motivated by personal gain.

You will note that I did not (and do not) deny the existence in the past of benign MIT tinkerers who called themselves "hackers". Whether this usage of hacker is derived from golf is of little interest to me.<BR>
What is of interest to me are the independent phreakers/hackers whose use of "hack" derives from my posited roots, rather than the then little-known "wimpy" MITers and their descendents. It is not logical that a counter-culture group would adopt a term derived from the "uncool" mainstream sport of golf.<BR>
Given the predilection of youth for tough or "cool" nicknames, many would naturally adopt the monicker of "hacker" in honour of the phreakers/hackers, counter-culture heroes. When the phreakers fell out of grace, many people did not want to be associated with "real" criminals. Casting about, they dredged up the lesser-known MITers and their descendents. What followed was a jumping from a "bad" family tree to a "good" one. To bolster their new-found lineage, the extent of the "good" fore-fathers was exaggerated. (If you are going to quibble about my previous use of "claimed" parentage, note that a claim can be based on either truth or falsehood.)<BR>
As for my "lie" regarding phrack--&gt;hack, this prevarication was thrown in to see who would fall for it. Given your erudition, you were not one of the "suckers". Excuse me if I do not match your seriousness in this matter.<BR>
As to how many of today's computer hackers (enthusiasts or criminals) come from the phreaker family tree or the MIT family tree, I leave this question to historical statisticians. Given the nature of youth to favour rebellion, I suspect that most come from the phreaker tree. I therefore object to the insistence that the primary definition of "hacker" is enthusiast rather than break-in artist.<BR>
If you are truly looking for rigorous verbal jousting, I suggest that you submit your theory to an etymological journal for review by your peers, rather than spend further time picking apart my somewhat light-hearted analysis. Please inform us as to when your views appear in print.<BR>
P.S. - Labelling me as an ESR supporter just because my views do not exactly match yours is not worthy of you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It also predates the type of telephone crime referred to as "phreaking," which had its origins in the mid-1960s.
<BR><BR>
You overlook the fact that it is quite clear that "hacker" took on a criminal meaning for <i>computer enthusiasts</i> very early in the history of computing.  The later chapters of Levy's book are packed with descriptions of students engaging in breaking and entering, theft, and other crimes, at MIT in particular, and then referring to it as "hacking."
<BR><BR>
I don't contest the notion that the word originally had negative meanings, and that contemporary computers-enthusiasts are engaged in an attempt to whitewash those meanings.  In fact, I believe I've found the origin of these efforts, and <a href="/">Adequacy</a> will expose it at length when we have time.
<BR><BR>
I don't think you're quite as "light hearted" in all this as you claim to be, AR, and your claim that your disproven assertions were "not serious" sounds a lot like sour grapes.
<BR><BR>
I called you an ESR-disciple not as a simple-minded smear-by association, but rather out of a suspicion that your advancement of easily discredited ideas might be in service of indirectly validating the etymological notions of ESR, which are slightly more difficult to debunk.  Your insinuation that <a href="/">Adequacy</a> is not a proper forum for serious intellectual inquiry, in addition to being laughable, lends some support to this suspicion.

<BR><BR>
And it looks as though my suspicions were correct-- you seem to be under the impression that ESR's "thoughts" on my article would discredit it in a way presumably related to his "authority" on the matter.  Does ESR publish his ideas in academic journals?  Of course not.  He publishes them on his "home turf," his own web-site, and does not so much as provide a forum for comment.

I've challenged all proposed derivations that I'm aware of, not just ones posted on <a href="/">Adequacy</a>.  I've refuted the ones that are clearly at odds with history, such as your own.  Others are still possible, of course, but, I feel, much less likely than the golf explanation.

<BR>
In computer terms, what hacker originally meant was someone who discovered new things by constantly trying out different things at random until they found something that worked, as opposed to following structured design methodology.  This is much the same as the hacker on the golf course which the article refers to.
<BR>

<BR>
In the criminal sense, people would try out lots of different ways of breaking into a computer, until they found a way that worked.  In that sense, "cracking" is a form of "hacking", and crackers are a subset of the hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
"Hackers" who do not fall into the "cracker" group get upset at being associated with them, though to call "crackers" "hackers" is strictly correct, but a slightly incomplete description.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This, of course, is the derivation offered by the Jargon File, first circulated in 1975.
<BR><BR>
It's a somewhat plausible explanation, as it conjures up a particularly American mythos, that of the Frontier.  The problem with it, as with the hired-carriage-horse explanation, is that the usage was a little-known historical curiosity by the time technology-enthusiasts adopted the word.
<BR><BR>
Keep in mind that this furniture-making described as "hacking" took place not only in the absence of mass production and machine tools, but in the absence of such basic tools as hand saws, nails, hand drills, and the like.  The era in which lack of such tools was widespread in the United States ended at least a hundred years before technology-enthusiasts started using the word.
<BR><BR>
Golf, on the other hand, was the subject of small talk everywhere.
<BR><BR>
Why, then, does the Jargon File give its peculiar derivation?  The answer is obvious to any student of American cultural history (yes, yes, I know that phrase sounds hilarious to many Europeans, but there is nonetheless a reality to be described here).
<BR><BR>
During the rise of the American Counterculture of the 60s, Computers-enthusiasts identified strongly with the new contrarian spirit and rejection of the established social order.  Golf, however, was emblematic of the old, "square" society (until the game was rehabilitated at the hands of the film <i>Caddyshack</i> in 1980) and computers-enthusiasts would have eagerly suppressed any prior association with the game.  
<BR><BR>
The contrived primitive-woodworking explanation for the word "hacker," with its overtones of a hippie-like "return to nature," served this social need quite neatly, and eventually found its way into the Jargon File.<BR><BR><BR>

At first glance there seems to be a relation, but there isn't.  RobotSlave draws a relation between the use of the golf term 'hacker' and the use of the computer term 'hacker'.  You say technology people like chess more.
<BR>

<BR>
This would be fine and dandy if 'hacker' were a chess term, too.  But you're not making that argument.  And I've never* seen the term 'hacker' applied in chess.  And I've read a lot about chess.  And I've been called just about every (English) chess insult.

There's a generic definition of hacker (see http://www.m-w.com) as:<BR>
"A person who is inexperienced or unskilled at a particular activity."<BR>
For a particular instance where a chess player is referred to as a hacker, go to google and enter:<BR>
chess hacker Lasker<BR>
as search terms. Part way down the page you'll find an item titled "Lasker" at www.insight.demon.co.uk where one of the players in a 1910 match is described as playing like a "hacker".<BR>
As for the exact time line when hacker first was used in either golf or chess, I think that this won't be resolved unless one does an exhaustive search through the literature (not necessarily the internet).<BR>
I have no personal stake in this search, and would encourage interested adequacy readers to track this down.<BR>
