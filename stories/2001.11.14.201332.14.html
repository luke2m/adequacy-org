		This week marks the release of the highly-anticipated <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/059035342X/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a> movie, which is based on a series of outrageously popular books by author <a href="http://www.jkrowling.com">J. K. Rowling</a>.  The books have found a particularly ravenous audience in young children, who are fascinated by the tales of adventure and wizardry that the books present.  Many have commented that it is wonderful to see children put aside video games and television and engage in the intellectual pursuit of reading.  Others have suggested that the books are works of pure evil, and that they are a corrupting societal influence that must be fought and eventually destroyed.<p>

Regretfully, I must side with the latter group.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I am an atheist, and as such, I believe that the supernatural twaddle that so many
people wave around like dirty laundry is exactly that ... twaddle.  There are no <a href="http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_myth_gods_alphabetical_index.htm">gods</a>,
devils, <a href="http://www.cia.gov">spooks</a>, <a href="http://www.sfvisitor.org/">fairies</a>, wraiths, <a href="http://www.bocelli.net../../images/Press_VOA_Danny_DeVito.JPG">hobgoblins</a>, <a href="http://northpole.net/">Santa Clauses</a>, or <a href="http://www.chaim.org/easter.htm">Easter Bunnies</a>.
Futhermore, the sooner the rest of the world realizes this, the better.  We can ill
afford another group of <a href="http://www.noi.org/">zanies</a> slamming a fleet of Boeing 767s into high-value targets
simply because we don't say the same set of "prayers" that they do.  Additionally, we
don't need large numbers of <a href="http://www.armyofgod.com/">lunatics</a> within our borders stockpiling Bibles and .50
caliber rifles so that one day they can fight a glorious war for their lord against
the "<a href="http://www.atf.treas.gov/">fed-ruhl gummint</a>" and the "<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com">lib-ruhl media</a>."<p>

No, the evidence is clear that supernaturalistism in all of its forms has manifested
itself in the most evil of all possible ways throughout the course of human history.
Since the dawn of time, civilizations have committed an untold number of atrocities in
the same of some god or set of gods.  Now, the apologists will argue that religion
has given us Good Things such as <a href="http://www.paris.org/Monuments/NDame/">breathtaking cathedrals</a>, priceless <a href="http://sun.science.wayne.edu/~mcogan/Humanities/Sistine/">works of art</a>, and
<a href="http://www.agsa.org/index.html">stained-glass windows</a> ... but let's not be <a href="http://slashdot.org">children</a> here.  Artists are artists, and
they will create art regardless of whether or not they believe that there's some
invisible spook that's going to zap them with lightning bolts if they don't paint a
truly great picture.<p>

Clearly, supernaturalistism is something that needs to be countered and dealt with in an appropriate manner.  Fortunately, we're making great strides towards that goal.  Churchgoing
rates are plummeting, particularly in Europe, where you are ten times more likely to
find a couple having <A HREF="http://www.pattithomas.com/">recreational sex</a> on a Sunday morning than you are to find them
<A HREF="http://krishna.org/chanting/">chanting</a> in some church.  Even in the supernaturalist-soaked United States, less and
less people are going to church.  A <A HREF="http://www.thepioneer.com/sept29_church.htm">brief spike</a> in <A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-000089746nov10.story?coll=la%2Dheadlines%2Dbusiness%2Dmanual">church attendance</a> numbers following
the 9/11 attacks has since corrected itself to pre-attack levels.  Furthermore, the
majority of people who do attend church do so out of habit ... not out of some genuine
religious conviction.  Perhaps they like the <A HREF="http://www.thisislondon.com/dynamic/news/story.html?in_review_id=327705&amp;in_review_text_id=270744">post-service coffee</a>.  Perhaps they enjoy
the chance to converse with their peers and swap stories about "<A HREF="http://www.eonline.com">who's banging who</a>."
The <I>reasons</i> for the drop are largely irrelevant; it is the drop <I>itself</i> that matters.<p>

Consequently, today's children are being told the truth instead of being <A HREF="http://www.afghan-web.com/">bombarded</a> with
all sorts of god-soaked gobbledygook about prayer and devils and how <I>purely evil</i> they
are.  They are being told that in the end, they need to look out for number 1, that there
is no <A HREF="http://www.spe.sony.com/tv/shows/tick/">cosmic caped man</a> that is going to fly in from the sky and pull them out of a
burning building as long as they "pray hard enough."  They aren't being told that other
people from other cultures are evil and subhuman because they are "infidel devils."  They
are being taught respect and tolerance for all people, and these are exactly the values
that are needed to restore sanity to a world that has quite clearly gone mad.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439064864/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a> threatens all of this.<p>

Even though today's children are being "trained up" in a more responsible manner than
in previous generations, one thing remains constant: children are dangerously
impressionable.  When they read "<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439136350/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a>" and soak up tales about wizards and
witches who work magic and cast "spells", society runs the very real risk that they will
start questioning their purely rationalist upbringing and begin asking themselves if
maybe ... just maybe .. there isn't something to all of this.  "What if magic is real?"
they ask themselves.  "What if there are fundamental aspects of this universe that we
cannot detect with our instruments of science, strange and wonderful facets of reality
that have woven themselves tightly into the very fabric of spacetime?"<p>

Here is where rationalists must be very wary of our "friend" <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0939173379/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a>.<p>

Fundamentalist Christians often complain that faiths such as Wicca, Paganism, Shinto,
Unitarianism, Catholicism, etc. are threats because they siphon away sheep from the
flock and place them in "false religions."  They claim that the <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0970844204/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a> phenomenon
is a major factor in this supposed massive exodus from the "true religion."  I claim
that the opposite is true; if the majority of today's children are irreligious
rationalists and they are led to believe that Magick is reality and not fantasy, then
they will naturally gravitate towards Wiccanistism or similar faiths .. as a first step.<p>

With their <A HREF="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/wiccansclub">Wiccan friends</a>, children will get their first taste of the <A HREF="http://www.absolut.com/">inebriating</a>
euphoria of supernaturalistism.  They'll engage in <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/9577/rites.html">bizarre rituals</a> and start believing
ridiculous and completely unsupported notions about the world around them.  They will
forget the teachings of <A HREF="http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/thomas_paine/age_of_reason/">Thomas Paine</a> and become enamored with ideas so profoundly
strange and obscene that they boggle the mind.  Wicca and the various other "<A HREF="http://www.treeleaves.com/wwwboard/messages/1.html">minority
faiths</a>" that are practiced in the Western world are widely regarded as "<A HREF="http://www.smokedot.org/">stepping-stone</a>"
religions; they give people a temporary (but extremely unhealthy) high that leads them
to want to do it more and more.  Pretty soon, it won't be enough.<p>

And then one day, when they're leaving they're latest Wicca (or whatever) service,
there will be <A HREF="http://www.patrobertson.com/">a man</a> there waiting for them.  An unassuming man, to be sure; he will
likely be dressed in plain, <A HREF="http://desires.com/1.4/Style/Docs/leisure.html">unthreatening clothes</a>, sporting an <A HREF="http://www.chesapeakes.net/homepages/visitors/lisah-keeper-smile-1.jpg">inviting smile</a>.  He
may be carrying a harmless-looking leatherbound book.  He leans forward to your child,
and whispers in his ear: "Want to try something really good?"<p>

That's when children get sucked into the sordid underworld of hard religion.<p>

The hard religions, such as <A HREF="http://www.christianity.com/cbn">Christianity</a>, <A HREF="http://www.aljazeera.net/">Islam</a>, and <A HREF="http://www.dreamworks.com">Judaism</a>, are by and large black holes that strive to suck our children in and never let them go.  When rationalists are preyed upon by the hard religions and they venture beyond the proverbial event horizon, they often end up spending their lives wandering around bleary-eyed, a sort of silly grin on their face as they aimlessly meander, oblivious to the reality of the world around them.  They mumble platitudes and spew absurdities; they become a shell of their once-rational and intelligent selves.  It is likely that the detrimental effects that hard religions causes to rational society will never be accurately measured.<p>

Still, there's hope.  Not even black holes can last forever; the principles of <A HREF="http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/hawk.html">Hawking radiation</a> predict that even the largest black hole will eventually evaporate.  The same is true of the hard religions.  But <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439286239/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a> is <i>not helping us</i> here, and it is the duty of the <A HREF="http://www.infidels.org">freethinker community</a> to fight him.  No, the <A HREF="http://www.prodcat.panasonic.com/shop/templates/square_template.asp?ModelId=10636&amp;show_all=false&amp;product_exists=True&amp;active=1&amp;ModelNo=NI-760R">irony</a> of the fighting the same enemy as the fundamentalists is not lost on me.  But war, as they say, makes strange <A HREF="http://personals.yahoo.com">bedfellows</a>; the fundamentalists may not understand the true reasons why <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439201284/adequacy-20">Harry Potter</a> is such a threat, but <i>we do</i>.  And if they're willing to fight our battles for us, then so much is the better.      <br><br></div>

That pretty much invalidates everything you have written. You should have put that at the end, so normal people would give this article a serious read before dismissing it.<BR><BR>

<i>There are no gods</i><br>
Agreed, there is only one, so I suppose you were correct about something. As for the rest of that paragraph, it is so utterly deviod of sensible thought that it defies explanation. Us 'lunatics' with our .50 cals are just here to protect our way of life. Unless the government chooses to put itself into harm's way we won't be bothering anyone, only exercising our Constitutional right to life and liberty, or at least the defense thereof. <BR><BR>

You should really get to church more often. I bet that with one visit to church per week, plus an hour or two per day reading the bible, all of the paranoid delusional hatred that is so obviously pent up inside you would be washed away by the cleansing Word of the Lord. In no time you would be full of the Holy Ghost, speaking in tongues and seeing the signs and wonders you'd read about in the Bible. Once you got yourself cleaned up you could join us in leading children away from evil like Harry Potter, but not just to push them further toward the abyss of secular humanism that you seem to love, but toward God.

<BR>
Just because someone is an athiest doesn't mean that they are instantly wrong...Just like being a part of a church doesn't instantly make anyone right (might I remind you that more people have been killed in the name of the Christian God than were killed by the Nazis durring the Holocaust)
<BR>

<BR>
I USED to go to church...until I realized that it was a load of bull.  That is my personal belief.  You can believe in God if you want, but 'He' has done nothing for me but cause me to start to go blind, be picked on because people thought that there was a remote possibilty that I was gay (it's always fun pysically fighting a religious Zealot who's acting on false information), randomly get unexplained internal bleeding all through my adolescence, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, I have plenty to thank 'The Divine Being' for.
<BR>

<BR>
There's also the fact that all the churches I've ever been in for any period of time were run by theives, but I blame Ohio for that more than Christianity...
<BR>

<BR>
I get constant calls trying to convert me and "bring me back into the fold"...it's annoying and violates my privacy.  You can have your constiutional right to practice religion, but pushing it on other people who want nothing to do with it is just plain wrong.

I cannot imagine that God personally foisted your problems upon you. Most likely, if those were purposeful acts done unto you by God, there would have been some locusts or frogs or something like that involved. Regardless, this clearly demonstrates that you were tainted by the weak willed leftists long before Christianity was able to turn your life around. Anyone who just gives up on God becuase they are getting bullied a bit would fit right in with that crowd.<BR><BR>
If you don't want to worship God, fine. It isn't my lot to worry too much about you. As long as you are aware that your eternal soul damned to hell I feel like I have done all I can.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

<BR>
That threat has long since stopped working on me.  In fact, if there is yet another hell, then I'd be glad to take it on...see how bad it truly is.
<BR>

<BR>
My theory is that if there is a Hell, then I'm already there.  It seems that about 90% of what I run into is based on blind obedience to something that cannot be proved and supports narrow-minded bi-polar views in a world that isn't just Black and White....which ticks me off to no end since this kind of thinking is what leads to racism, religionism, sexism, and so on.  As a sidenote; it cannot be disproved either except on an individual, personal level.
<BR>

<BR>
This doesn't even scratch the surface of my 'hell' theory or why I believe religion of any sort is just plain wrong...that would require a rather long, drawn out explanation that I do not have time for right now...and one you would just ignore and denounce anyway.

I was expecting a Christian rant on this.  I was rather surprised to see it as a "leading to religion".  Nice spin on it.

If you look at history, people have always believed in magic one way or another (Even Christians, who say it doesn't exist...Salem Witch Hunt anyone?).  I believe that they always will when it comes to anything unexplained.  It could even be argued that God/Gods themselves are magical beings.
<BR>

<BR>
I am also an athiest.  I read fantasy books where they cast magic and such (J.R.R. Tolkien's works, R.A. Slavatore's D&D books, etc).  I also play RPGs (that's "Role Playing Games", for the uninformed) and watch stuff like Record of Lodoss War, BASTARD!, and am planning on seeing the upcomming Lord of the Rings movies; though the LOTR movies has more to do with knowing a girl that was in the weapons and armor department than anything else.  I've participated in stuff like this ever since I could read (I read stuff like The Hobbit and fully comprehended it when I was about 6, just to give a time reference)
<BR>

<BR>
This doesn't mean that I believe in magic.  I just think that it is a neat idea...I mean, who wouldn't want to have stuff like Gandalf's fireworks displays or levetation? *note: rhetorical question...I know some smartass will reply to it saying "I don't"*<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
One of our psychologists has stated that you may be "Creating your own fantasy world where you are a grounding center to the great moral questions of our times" and in order to make this a reality you must take ill-founded opinions and irrational views to feel as though you have a purpose. You are not as far as I can tell an intellegent individual. Your many mental shortcomings are readily apparent. 
<BR>

<BR>
I cant be sure but I assume that you consider research as first deciding your standing and then looking for anything that makes your statement look correct. Including gross misrepresentation and use of misinformation. Either you are doing this deliberatly or have been sorely misinformed yourself. I personally believe that you know that what your saying is inaccurate. Why would someone do this? Because they don't respect the opinions of others and they feel that they must force their own beliefs to make everyone think exactly like themselves. You sir appear to be, in a few words, SELFISH and IGNORANT.
<BR>

<BR>
As of now you seem to stand with those people who beleive that "rock music was created by satan and those who listen to it are his unwitting followers." I personally do not like rock music. I find it tastless and depressing, but it is not my right to decide for ANYONE whether they enjoy it or not. The same applies for movies, books, and the way they choose to spend their free-time.
<BR>

<BR>
In the case of your son(the one you call a "Hacker") is not in need of limitations but of liberation from your severely lacking parenting abilities. Children need only to internalize what is right and wrong. Children are most impressionable when in early childhood not during the teens. By the age of 15 most morals are held to firmly. Children have even better morals than most adults. They don't care about money, friends and reletives are priority one, and they don't comprehend hate. Children however also need guidance when they need help, not more problems and limitations. Respect your children they are people too. Do not forget they may be of greater moral character and more observant than you are. 
<BR>
Trust is the foundation of love and wrongful restriction is the founder of hate. Trust your children show them that you love them.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

In reality, of course, all atheists spout the exact same childish drivel, not even stopping for a second to try and figure out what Christianity is all about.

"theists", surely? Sorry to be a dictionary nazi, but let's get things straight here.
<ul>
<li><b>atheist</b> - believes no god exists
<li><b>monotheist</b> - believes only one god exists
<li><b>polytheist</b> - believes many gods exist
<li><b>agnostic</b> - spineless coward who takes the philosophically easy way out
</ul>

An atheist is as much a "believer" as your kind self. He will explain his untenable belief in the non-existance of any god to you, as soon as you explain your untenable belief in the existance of a god to him.

<br><br>
<i>atheists wisen up once they realize that they won't live forever</i><br><br>

Where exactly did you get this one from? Atheists don't have their
vision clouded by the false promise of Heaven or immortal souls. They know that they time they have in their life is <i>all they're gonna get</i>, and they can either spend the time wisely, or squander it.

<br><br>

The mass conversion to religion as death approaches is what you see in the simpleton man, who fears the unknown and genuinely believes that ticking the box on the back of a Chick tract will continue his life beyond the grave. Sorry, but when you die, you're worm food. There is no 'heaven'. There is no 'spirit world'. There is no 'immortal soul'. Get over it. Your only further contribution to society will be the creation of some more oil, gas and coal in a few million years time.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

That's quite correct. Thankfully, atheists are not nihilists, but believers. Believers in a world without gods, and believers in a strong societal moral structure without the need for a church to control it.

<br><br><i>If you want to do the nihilist act, you will have to combine it with Christian theology.</i><br><br>

Well, as Christians prefer their god to their neighbour, perhaps it's only fitting that they be labeled as nihilists. There's certainly nothing for them here, in 'this world'.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

In some ways, Atheists are better off because they, at least, don't think that this belief stuff is just a simple thing.  Most people who claim to be believers are just Atheists who confuse God with themselves.  Or with their dad.  Or their local guru.

It just doesn't make for a good argument.  You need to make the subtle distinction between those "adolescent atheists" which I do acknowledge exists and those who have given the situation serious thought.  I began as an adolescent atheist but have progressed beyond that point.
    The reason I'm an atheist is because I truly don't believe there's any being out there guiding us/world/universe.  I think that life has to exist, maybe not in our form and not even intelligent life, but life <strong>must</strong> exist.  Now, this is a version of faith just as your (I assume you're a christian) faith in your god.  But I would rather believe in myself and chance (synchronicity) than in god.  Also, my faith is not sufficient to believe something I cannot see evidence of.  While you may pass this off as an evil of science, I highly doubt anyone else would call empirical evidence "adolescent".  
I have accepted responsibility and support myself.  I also know that I won't live forever and I do not fear death (on a gut-level).  My existence is a boon to me but I do not and cannot believe that it has any significance other than to me and those around me.  However, don't think I'm depressed by that (many people seem to think that when I explain this that since I accept my own demise and am not afraid that I must be some misanthrope or goth or something:  this is not the case.

Atheism is not adolescent nor rebellious.  It is the mature conscious belief that there is no higher being or after life.  This doesn't necessarily mean hostility towards those who believe in the traditional god(s).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There is a difference between "not believing in God" and "being an atheist". Being "atheist" implies that you believe in putting yourself in active opposition to society and God. (Read your diary entry again.) Atheism by definition is rebellion; <b>you</b> may spout the usual atheist apologetics, but 99% of the people mean "rebellion from God and society" when they say "atheism".

So according to you, the vast majority of Christians reject the notion that accepting Jesus as one's Lord and personal savior is a prerequisite to entering Heaven.  According to you, this is not a basic principle of the religion, but something that is held only by "hard-line fundamentalists."  Old Mohandes, Confucius, and Everybody That We Like are at this minute on Cloud 9, whereas (coincidentally) Everybody That We Don't Like is roasting in hell.  Sure, Everybody That We Like consists of a large number of non-Christians, but that doesn't matter.  They're still in Heaven, because We Like them.<BR><BR>

Do you hold any beliefs that you're courageous enough to defend, or would you rather spend the entirety of your waking hours in a warm and fuzzy leftist "group hug" mentality where your religion is essentially reduced to nothing?  After all, if you (as a Christian) posit that Heaven is full of non-Christians, then precisely what do you have left?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you would be so kind as to point this out, I would appreciate it.  I must admit that it is I that is taken aback.  When I was a Christian, it was standard teaching that the way to get to Heaven was to accept Jesus as your savior and in doing so allow him to bear the burden of your sins for you.  There are numerous verses in the Bible that state this.  Jesus himself said "There is no way to the Father but through me."<BR><BR>

If I'm reading all of this correctly, apparently the prevailing sentiment of Christianity has changed, and Jesus really doesn't matter that much anymore. Anybody can get to heaven. If that's what the modern Christian thinking is, then I must in all honesty applaud it.  It is a far cry from the divisive and exclusionary claims of Christians of generations past.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>

So, simply accepting that "OK, I believe if Jesus" is not enough. If you want to spend eternity with God, you have to make a conscious effort to do so,

something that is both spiritually and physically difficult. Nobody is holding your hand -- if you want to become closer to God, you need to proactively do it yourself.

Which is very hard in our society and our world.

P.S. Nobody knows what happens after death, except God. We can make educated guesses, based on the experience and knowledge of spiritually advanced people, but any guess we make is still going to be a rough approximation.

I know that Rand-bashing is (for whatever reason) a popular sport. I suppose it helps people feel better about themselves to attack somebody who can't defend themselves.  But I will tell you this: One day I came to the realization that I was lost.  Completely lost.  I had no idea where I was, or where I was going.  Despair was beginning to set in.  I desparately needed to get back on the right road, but I lacked the tools to do it.<BR><BR>

That's when I found Rand.<BR><BR>

I picked up a copy of "Atlas", and within minutes my sense of direction had been completely restored.  <i>I was back, baby.</i>  Rand had saved me from my despair.  No more would I wander around aimlessly with my hands thrown up in exasperation.<BR><BR>

So you go ahead and take your juvenile pot-shots at Mr. McNally, but had it not been for his atlas, I might still be meandering around the suburbs of St. Louis.  Now what do you think about that, smart guy?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
whole) to promote violence.
<BR>

<BR>
        Here's why:
<BR>
        
<BR>
        Believing in a God and an after-life is denying that there are consequences for 
<BR>
your actions, denying that life ends and is therefore precious, denying that we, not an 
<BR>
omnipotent creator, are responsible for what goes on here, and denying ultimately, that
<BR>
 what we do here is important.
<BR>

<BR>
        Believing that no matter how much you fuck up, God will love you, leaves you
<BR>
 completely free to fuck up.
<BR>

<BR>
        I can't tell you how many times I've heard, "What we do here isn't important, it's 
<BR>
the next life that matters."
<BR>

<BR>
        At the risk of alienating the religious readers, that is a bunch of shit, because 
<BR>
there is no "next life".  
<BR>

<BR>
        George Lucas once wrote,(In Star Wars Two)"Always with him is the future, never 
<BR>
his mind on where he was! What he was doing!"
<BR>

<BR>
        Maybe that's why despite all the technology in the world, there's still 
<BR>
discrimination in the world, because nobody cares about what goes on here, and nobody
<BR>
 will take to time to improve things.
<BR>

<BR>
        My whole point is that it DOES matter what we do here, that Pacifism is the way, 
<BR>
but does anyone listen or even care?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This doesn't give you carte blanche to go off and do horrible things, it just acknowledges that we aren't perfect and that there is something out there that is.<BR><BR>
How believing in an afterlife is denying that there are consequences for your actions in this one is beyond my logical understanding. It doesn't work that way in Christianity, and it doesn't work that way in any other religion that believes in an afterlife or in reincarnation. What you do in this life has a direct impact on what happens to you in the next one, whether you are Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim.<BR><BR>
As for pacifism being the way, I have to disagree. Some things are worth fighting for in this life, and even Star Wars supports that view.

In the absence of any hard evidence that there is a god (sorry, but your gut feeling doesn't really sway me) I am personally inclined to believe, by default, that there is no god.

This is based on the same reasoning by which I have determined that there is no Santa Claus, no fairies, and no magic.
<BR>

<BR>
One could equally argue that being an atheist is the default way to be, and that being religious is a rebellion against rational thinking and common sense. In essence, you regard theism as the "normal" way to be just because that's what YOU believe (and perhaps because several billion other gullible people have a similar gut feeling).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

i have to agree with you. atheism is fashionable nowadays. but like all
<BR>
fashionable things it stems from wanting to be different from everyone
<BR>
else. seeing as mostly everyone else is christian (in the western
<BR>
societies) it then makes sense to differentiate yourself from everyone
<BR>
else (and hence) renounce faith in God. it's people scrambling for a
<BR>
pedestal (metaphorically, to place themselves `above' everyone else) in a
<BR>
world where we're all much of a muchness. self-flattery i guess.

Ignoring the post infused with drug usage, the prior poster speaks of imagination as a stress release mechanism.  Post #30 talks more about the problems that frequent vacations from reality cause society as a whole.  It isn't stated that imagination in and of itself is a waste of time, but that excessive amounts of time spent imagining for entertainment's sake can be a bad thing for some people.
<BR>

<BR>
Post #30 posits that the true problem is "human tendency to retreat from reality into imaginary stories".  Actually, both "problems" are one and the same, but explicitly naming the most base retreat from reality (atheism) to imaginary (religion) is acceptable.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

At our very base, we deal only in symbols: symbols of our power, our hunger and our desire.  When we build bridges they're as much a symbol of our desire to cross a river as they are the means to actually do it.  Focusing on the simple process of building the bridge itself makes you miss the point of building it all together.
<BR>

<BR>
So, to get back to the Harry Potter books (which, I have to admit, I haven't read), it isn't so terrible for young people to see symbols moving through their culture.  The thing about books is, unlike life, they're a somewhat self-contained process that we can know in totality.  Harry sets a goal, works toward it and accomplishes it, then enjoys its rewards or suffers its consequences.  What "rubbish" like this does is allow us to exercise our cognitive faculties in exploring our own culture and cognition, our own motivations and distinctions.

I did like your argument, it's great that you're coming from a different angle, but I disagree.

So, has all this fantasy made me easy prey for religion, our good 'ole <strong>opiate of the masses</strong>.  If anything, I believe that things like Harry Potter and other fantasy makes for a more balanced worldview.  At least it did in my case.  I never thought any of it was real.
<BR><BR>And as a child, I was <strong>enraged</strong> by the stupidity of other children.  Maybe nobody else remembers, but there was a board game called Stratego or perhaps something very similar and in the commercial the figures upon the playing pieces talked.  Now, even though I read gobs of <strong>fantasy</strong> I never once believed that the pieces could talk.  
<BR><BR>Yet, many children out there did and the company had to put a message at the bottom of their commercial stating that the pieces didn't talk.
<BR><BR>You know what it is? Survival of the fittest.  If it wasn't for our so-called <i>civil</i> society, those kids would be dead.  Some of them are.  There are the kids who killed their friends because they were dumb and thought they heard messages in their Judas Priest record playing backward, the kid who burned down his house because Beavis and Butthead said that fire was cool on MTV.
<BR><BR>Statistics, that's what these children were.  Any child who believes that these works of <strong>fiction</strong> have any significance beyond that of entertainment a)Has bad parents who haven't explained reality and fantasy well enough b)is soft-willed and will make nothing of themselves and c)will probably become a Potterist.

It's a unique attempt in that instead of trying to "remap" the Old Testament directly onto European culture, it works backwards from ancient European culture and the New Testament to what a hypothetical European Old Testament <em>would have</em> been like. In my opinion, a brilliant religious and cultural work. 

<BR><BR>

If you don't trust me, simply reread the Silmarillion and LOTR again, keeping an eye out for the Christian symbolism. Tolkien goes so far as to even include a prophecy for the coming of Christ at the end of LOTR. 

<BR><BR>

P.S. Little known fact: Tolkien was a devout catholic and close friend of C.S. Lewis; in fact, Tolkien was a deciding factor in the conversion of C.S. Lewis to Christianity.

For the record, LOTR does <b>not</b> have sorcery. Gandalf is called a "wizard" by the other characters in the book, because of his immense personal wisdom and strength of character, but nowhere in the book does he ever demonstrate supernatural powers! It's true. Also, the "inferiour races" are "inferiour" only in the eyes of the more advanced chracters of the book. That is really one of the main point of LOTR -- that moral imperatives make sense only if they stem from a higer power. There are many parables in the book that deal with suposedly "moral" people who think they are acting rationally and ethically, only to end up becoming more evil and immoral.

Religion is just another power structure, I agree.  But our ability to think and behave creatively is what yields our greatest progresses.

I would disagree with him on the point of bashing fantasy altogether, because there is definitely a proper and important place for fantasy fiction.
<BR>

<BR>
By extention of his "Who'll think of the children?" argument, he would have to side with the conservative Christian groups who want to ban violence and sex from TV.

<BR>

<BR>
"There are no gods, devils, spooks, fairies, wraiths, hobgoblins, Santa Clauses, or Easter Bunnies."
<BR>

<BR>
Not a single one is in the movie! Not a single one!
<BR>

<BR>
Not only is the author poorly versed in mythology, but also he makes many assumptions about things he does not understand. Some of the mythical creatures are active god haters. If that is not the very antithesis of religion, I don't know what is. 
<BR>

<BR>
Furthermore, it would help to study just a little bit of history. In the middle ages, when viciious packs of inquisitors were roaming the land - the common people needed a practical out to having to do what the "religious" people said they should do. That practical out was superstition. It was used to RESIST the power of religious authority.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In your zeal to bash the writer, you merely skim the surface of his point.  Perhaps you've invoked Godwin's Law in the hopes that noone will respond to your drivel.  Contrary to your claims, I doubt that anyone since Hitler has superceded his "evilness".  I also doubt you would kick anyone's ass because of their theology or lack thereof, but maybe you are controlled by your ignorance.
<BR>

<BR>
On to the meat.  The reason that not one single reference to religion is made in the movie is obvious.  If any subconscious message is in conflict with a simultaneous conscious message, the subconscious one will have much less effect on the intended subjects.  Moreover, if references to religion were present, the public would have a much different opinion of the movie.  Many people, religious or not, do not like religion shoved down their throats, and the producers of Harry Potter understand this.  You obviously do not.  I point to the movie "Contact" as an example of a good movie ruined by theology.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you've also forgotten that a majority of those in power in America, both within the government and the private sector, are religous.  Maybe you've forgotten that religion has been crafted as the "answer" to many of our society's problems by said powerful people.  Maybe you've even forgotten how George W. Bush is attempting to blur the line between church and state.
<BR>

<BR>
On top of all that, perhaps you don't realize that with every passing year, scientists learn more and more about our universe and the laws which govern it.  Creationism is slowly falling out of grace with many religious types, in favor of evolutionism and the astounding volume of evidence which supports it.  Most people just don't believe anymore that the universe was created in six days, within the last five thousand years or so.
<BR>

<BR>
People who are "true" to their religion will rarely commit immoral acts.  For an extreme example, some religious people do not even drink alcohol or eat meat.  However, in today's society this seems to be much less common.  Religion today implies virtually nothing about a person's understanding and/or application of morals.  One need only recall people like Jim Bakker or Jerry Falwell, or recall the PTL scandal, for proof.
<BR>

<BR>
Philip, you could make a better attempt to debate the issue.  Whether it is your belief system preventing you, your intelligence, or your free will is open to debate itself.  Perhaps we can deduce that since you feel the article writer is worse than Hitler, and you would physically harm him if given the opportunity, that you are not even qualified to speak on behalf of religion.
<BR>

<BR>
I just hope that in light of my criticism of you and defense of the author, you don't think I'm worse than Hitler as well.

<BR>
If you recall, when Jodie Foster's character "travelled" in the alien craft, everyone said she never left.  Though we the viewer saw that she clearly did go somewhere, nobody believed her.  Except for the priest.
<BR>

<BR>
This mirrors people's belief in God, however they may interpret what God is.  There is no proof that He exists, yet for many that does not matter.
<BR>

<BR>
The place Ms. Foster travels to had sent explicit instructions on how to create a craft which enabled the trip.  And yet, when she arrives, she meets her father, who had passed away.  Apparently, we are to believe that afterlife exists AND that God exists.
<BR>

<BR>
Note that the title is ambiguous as well.  "Contact" is intended to refer to contact with alien species, but at the end we learn that it means contact with a higher power.
<BR>

<BR>
Consider now what the movie is trying to convey to the viewer.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I think you're all nuts.  A generation grew up with Star Wars, and I don't think many are out there using The Force or trying to become Jedi.

You seem to be blurring the lines of fiction and reality. A very serious problem that may require psychiatric counseling. OR your just posting garbage for the hell of it. 
<BR>

<BR>
Either way, harry potter is FICTION. It is a story. Are you really going to state that all FICTIONAL stories which portray fantasy characters are really making people believe in these things? Now if this was a non-fictional book about goblins and elves or whatever your argument might have some clout. But its FAKE! So after seeing the movie "the ghostbusters" do think suddenly everybody started believing in ghosts? Hell no!
<BR>

<BR>
Now obviously your going to argue that kids dont fully yet understand the difference between fiction and reality. Well, sure at a certain age they might think boogiemen exist under thier beds or in thier closets, and yes mabye they believe in santa or the tooth fairy. Now ask yourself, do you know one single adult who believes in the tooth fairy? If you do, this individual is most likely insane and hopefully belongs to a respectable mental institution. Its because as children mature they naturally develop the ability to seperate the real, from the made up. 
<BR>

<BR>
So, attacking a movie and a book series saying its the root of all evil in the world is about as valid as saying that leprechauns led you to a pot of gold. LMAO you people crack me up with your paranoid conspiricy theories. Keep em coming they give me a good laugh.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Please do not believe that your children are that stupid that they don't know the difference between reality and adventures... and if the unlikely appears to be true (that your child doesn't know the difference) by all means talk to your child in the end it is your responsibility to educate the child of things that are not on the curriculum.  Adventures are to make our life more fun, with more variety to it, boost our creativity and imagination.... and some of them really teach us things and have meanings that can be learned from.  Adventures have often been written to help people deal with things in life, it's easier to tackle some things indirectly through for instance adventures and stories, than have brought up to your face.
