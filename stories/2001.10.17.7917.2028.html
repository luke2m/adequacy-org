      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">The Constitution of the USA is a venerable document. For many Americans, it is almost a '<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/index.htm">sacred text</a>'. It is one of the <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com">many</a> <a href="http://www.cocacola.com">things</a> that <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/watergate.html">made</a> <a href="http://www.webcom.com/pinknoiz/covert/icsummary.html">America</a> <a href="http://www.historyamerica.com/TEXT_00/0002_KennedyLinks.html">great</a>, and which <a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mylai/mylai.htm">set us apart</a> from <a href="http://www.zmag.org/forums/chomiraqb.htm">other countries</a>. Unfortunately there are a couple of problems with it, which cannot easily be addressed, due to the <a href="http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/vi/#vi.vs.emacs">almost religious fervour</a> of the 'Constitutionally Correct' right wing elements in our society.<p>
These <a href="http://www.ulsternation.org.uk/conversation_with_rabbi_scilller.htm">reactionary forces of conservatism</a> seem to believe that the Constitution is set in stone, they have elevated it to the point where it has attained mystical significance, rather than being a simple functional document describing what the voting public believed in some 200 years ago.<p>
Suggest that it should be changed and you will bring on the wrath of <a href="http://tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/">fundamentalist</a> <a href="http://www.kukluxklan.org/kkkand.htm">constitution worshipping</a> <a href="http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/clam-faq.htm">lunatics</a> of <a href="http://www.davidicke.com">every shape</a> <a href="http://www.poplockin4jesus.com/">and form</a>.
<p>
To understand why the constitution must be radicaly redesigned, you have to go back a couple of hundred years. Think back to the kind of mindset which prevailed during those times. <a href="http://bubl.ac.uk/link/s/slavery.htm">Slavery was commonplace</a>. Women's rights were almost non-existant, indeed until the 19th Amendment was enacted, <a href="http://womenshistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa081700a.htm">they could not even vote</a>. Homosexuals were persecuted, the <a href="http://www.gayhistory.com/rev2/factfiles/ff1786.htm">death penalty for sodomy</a> was only revoked in South Carolina as recently as 1873.<a href="http://www.atheists.org">
Religious tolerance was not high on the agenda</a> with <a href="http://www.salemweb.com/guide/witches.htm">Wiccans singled out for especially poor treatement</a>.<p>
So as we can see, the constitution was borne of a period of history which most of us today would consider barbaric. This is what I see as a major problem with the constitution.<p>
The second problem with the constitution is that many of the amendments have perverted its original spirit.<p>
Consider the following 'amendments' to the constitution, and my explainations as to why they are harmful.<p>
<li><i><strong>First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</strong></i><p>
This is one of the MAJOR flaws in our constitution. The idea that all speech is of equal value. How ridiculous. The problem here is that it creates friction between groups, where a more restrictive law would promote harmony.<p>
Here in the USA we are allowed to use racial insults, and hurl abuse at respected religious figures in the name of "freedom", but
almost all civilized countries recognize that to protect the rights of minorities, it is necessary to <a href="http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/raceact/part9.htm">restrict freedom of speech</a>. This is not some Orwellian nightmare or Soviet-style oppression.<p>
It is simply good government. It forces us to respect minorites and diversity. This inevitably leads to a more harmonious society. Unrestricted freedom of speech is a lofty ideal, but 'Joe Sixpack' cannot be trusted not to abuse this right.<p>
Getting some reasonable restrictions on what can and cannot be said is the first step toward creating a racism-free society for our children.
<p>
<li><i><strong>Second Amendment: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.</strong></i><p>
Another glaring piece of constitutional stupidity. In the days when the most powerful weapon was an unreliable flintlock pistol, I guess it might have made sense to allow the public to own killing tools such as these. The chances of them actually working was remote. However in these days when the high tech arsenal of <a href="http://www.cobray.com/">Mac-10</a>, <a href="http://www.impactsites2000.com/site3/class3_10.htm">Tec-9</a>, <a href="http://www.glock.com">Glock</a>, <a href="http://www.imi-israel.com/imi/doa_iis.dll/Serve/item/English/1.1.2.12.2.1.html">Uzi</a>, <a href="http://www.heckler-koch.de">H&K MP5</a>, and various other tools of mass murder are in the hands of every <a href="http://bearfighters.20m.com/start.html">crack dealer</a> on <a href="www.virtualcrack.com">every corner</a>, does it really make sense to persist with such an anachronism ? Columbine is just one example of the thousands which demonstrate clearly the moral bankruptcy of <a href="http://www.vpc.org">allowing 'Joe Sixpack' to get his hands on these lethal toys</a>.<p>
Here we could learn a lot from our cousins across the pond. They recently outlawed handguns completely, and have experienced a spectacular fall in the number of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1440000/1440764.stm">crimes committed with legally held handguns</a>.<p>
If we do not start to remove guns from circulation our children face the prospect of <a href="http://www.cluebot.com/articles/00/10/12/0326212.shtml">Columbine</a> in their schools, or accidental death in the home. Is this a price worth paying for a constitutional amendment of so little practical value ?<p>
I realise that the gun hobbyists will object to having their toys taken from them, so I propose that we remove them gradually, like when someone is trying to get off drugs. We could start by outlawing all automatics, then semi-automatics a year later, then in further years handguns (45s 38s 9mm), and finally air pistols. The political outcry from the gun lobby would be a small price to pay for the <a href="http://www.millionmommarch.com">safety of our children</a>.

<li><i><strong>Seventh Amendment:  In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.</strong></i><p>
In these days of <a href="http://directory.findlaw.com">high priced lawyers</a>, is trial by jury really the most economic way to proceed ? Should the taxpayer be forced to pay for lawyers for known criminals ? It is ridiculous that all criminals should automatically have the right to trial by jury. In the vast majority of cases, the police know the person they caught was guilty, and it is obvious to everyone concerned. In such cases, the police should be allowed to use their discretion as to whether a jury trial is warranted.<p>
If the cost of the trial would amount to more than the cost of the alleged crime, then it is simple economics. The public interest is not served by a jury trial, the case should be decided by a hand-picked panel of expert judges to save time and money. (This should happen behind closed doors to avoid a <a href="http://www.dimensional.com/~randl/scopes.htm">media circus</a> like the <a href="http://europe.cnn.com/US/OJ/">OJ Simpson</a> <a href="http://members.aol.com/jessetg1/oj.htm">trial</a>). Again our <a href="http://www.elec.rdg.ac.uk/staff_postgrads/postgrads/at/europe.html">European friends</a> are <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_527000/527721.stm">ahead of our game</a> on this one<p>
<p>
The constitution is part of our history and one we should be proud of, but in these days of <a href="http://www.mediamonitors.net/hanania21.html">terrorism</a>, <a href="http://www.igc.apc.org/Womensnet/dworkin/">feminism</a>, multi-culturalism, globalization, <a href="http://www.aol.com">the internet</a>, <a href="http://www.mediamonitors.net/hanania21.html">cheap drugs</a> and <a href="http://www.recguns.com/topOutline.html">guns</a> it is starting to look less and less like a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Studio/6589/home.htm">sensible</a> way to run a society, and more like a recipie for the total breakdown of American society.<p>
My proposed solution to this is for the Federal Government to intervene, and develop a massive computer system which could be used to survey every single voter in the country on a wide variety of issues (gun rights, homosexual rights, maternity/paternity leave etc etc etc). This survey could be filled in online, by everyone in the country of voting age.<p>
Once the results were collated in the <a href="http://www.teradata.com">massive database</a>, they could be given to a team of constitutional lawyers who could then draft a new constitution for us.<p>
This constitution would be less '<a href="http://www.microsoft.com">buggy</a>' than our <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/mother.htm">18th century relic</a>, and therefore more easy to use. It would enumerate the rights that are relevent to <i>today's</i> society, and would better reflect the diversity of views and opinions that make up American society today.<p>
And it certainly would not allow teenagers to go on the rampage with automatic weapons, or rhinestone racists like <a href="http://www.duke.org">David</a> <a href="http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.html">Duke</a> and <a href="http://www.patrobertson.com">Pat</a> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/7027/patrobertson.html ">Robertson</a> to spew their vile <a href="http://www.dcs.ex.ac.uk/water/sewage.htm ">sewage</a> into our living rooms.<p>      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">An interesting and provocative piece. I entirely agree about the Second and Seventh Amendments, as I think any reasonable person would; although I definitely can see your point about the First Amendment, I would hesitate to overturn it, as that would wreak havoc on a large body of legal theory. I also think that a strong case can be made for the reconsideration of the Eleventh, Nineteenth, and Twenty-First Amendments.

<BR><BR>That said, I think you overlook the most pernicious, insidious provision in the entire Constitution, the Tenth Amendment:

<blockquote>The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. </blockquote>

What does this mean? It means that the government can only exercise a few powers explicitly listed in the Constitution--a Constitution written in the 17th Century, before governments in the modern sense existed. But this means that the federal government, in fact, can do very little at all. In the recent past, this has not been a problem, as a blissfully ignorant liberal judiciary let unpleasant provisions like this slide. For this lack of dilligence in legal scholarship, we can count ourselves fortunate. 

<BR><BR>But now, George W. Bush is set to appoint several members of the Supreme Court, and they will surely be hard-nosed legal scholars ("strict contortionists") who will no longer overlook unpleasant phrases like "reserved to the states." herefore, we can expect this provision to be taken seriously and expanded. 

<BR><BR>And that would be a gross disaster. Imagine a government with no ability to pass economic legislation. To run airport security. To run the FBI. To adjust interest rates. To raise an income tax. It would mean the end of America's position as the world's superpower. That's our future, unless we repeal the Tenth Amendment.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As for the article itself, I think the whole Constitution needs a massive overhaul.  It's been patched enough times, what we need is a 'revided draft,' updated for our time.

terrorism is thousands of years old. women have always been feminine. multiple cultures have always been in the presence of other cultures. trade made cultural sharing, and globalization possible. the printed word, radio, and television are the internets of the past. drugs have always been cheap, and most of the time, legal. if its not a gun, its anything else that maims.

if youre going to attempt to re write historical documents, start with your old testament. the difference is that the orators of the constitution dont claim to have divine interpretation. they didnt put a clause in that explained you would be eternally tormented if your personal beliefs varied. more importantly, they didnt claim they were correct. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Freedom of Speech is well defined only in the meaning of the word 'of'. Freedom and Speech are much more difficult to elaborate,
and all modern constitutions have provisions against hate speech just as the US has provisions against fighting words, but no protection for speech in commercial contexts where virtually all censorship takes place. The Constitution is a rhetorical document, not a logically coherent political theory.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Wow! I had no idea the Wiccans have been persecuted for so long.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I've often thought that the greatest flaw in the  US constitution is not the content. It is my feeling that the constitution would be greatly improved by use of language sufficient to express the exact intention of the document, rather than leaving every single sentence open to misinterpretation and argument. The fact that the United States cannot agree on the meaning of their most important legal document is a national disgrace. Do the British bicker over the intention of phrases in the Magna Carta? Of course they do not. Even the execrable Australians have managed to cobble together a constitution that does not provoke constant debate. Why can't the greatest nation on Earth do the same?
<BR>

<BR>
Of course, the various people responsible for drafting the constitution may be forgiven for their sloppy language. They were idealists, and the document is an idealistic document. It isn't intended to reflect reality, but serves instead as a advertisement for the US system of government. As such it has been quite effective. It has not been nearly so effective at promoting the rule of law, for the betterment of the people.
<BR>

<BR>
One disastrous side-effect of the constitution's idealistic language is it's approachability. Any armchair-lawyer can obtain a copy of the constitution, and at five minutes reading, consider himself a well-rounded constitutional lawyer, ready to irritate friends, family and nation with his new found knowledge, most of which is absurdly incorrect. It is both a triumph of english expression and a disaster of modern law that the US constitution has remained readable over two hundred years, while most other legal documents are all but incomprehensible.
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps the most regrettable flaw in the language of the constitution is that definitions are largely abandoned. It is quite well known that the words "freedom" and "liberty" did not refer to individuals prior to the civil war, simply because people did not respect the concept of individuality. When people in the eighteenth century said "the people" this was understood to mean "the people as a group" not "every individual in the nation". In many cases, the constitution uses the word "people" when it really means "states". The document would be vastly improved by the addition of a lengthy and precise and complete set of definitions prior to the body of the document. This step alone would have obviated much of the constitutional debate in the United States. The fact that it is absent is pure unforgiveable negligence.
<BR>

<BR>
In order to improve the rest of the document, a rigid structure must be adhered to, and the language provided in the definitions above strictly applied. Where documents exist to further describe and support the intention of the authors, citations should be given. Where it is necessary to use a word in a sense other than the definition given, a footnote should be made.
<BR>

<BR>
These are but a few of the alterations required to transform the constitution into a concrete legal document, and take it away from the clumsy hands of the people to place it firmly in the wiser experienced domain of the courts. The fact that the drafters of the constitution did not think to apply such linguistic precision has resulted in a nation that continues to drift further and further from their ideals, and promises to fragment completely if something is not done to correct their haphazard pseudo-legal compositions.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You are correct that a new constitution is needed to replace the sexist, racist, sizeist, ageist, carnivorocentric, homophobic, logocentric, phallically-overcompensating, scatophobic, blindist, deafist document that, despite it's offensiveness to decent, rational, caring environmentalists, labor activists, necrophiles, and persons who choose to engage in uncoerced, mutually fulfulling sexual relationships with large mammals,  is currently enshrined as the sacred founding document of our nation.  
<BR><BR>
I think that assembling a database based on polling every member of society (including, IMHO, children, incarcerated persons, the so-called "insane", the so-called "retarded", the so-called "victims of Alzheimers-related dementia", and the so-called "comatose") would be the perfect way to create a core governing document for our society.  However, I think that if we were to hand over the results "to a team of constitutional lawyers who could then draft a new constitution for us", we would be making the same terrible mistake as the "original" "founders".  
<BR><BR>
Instead, a sophisticated computer program (I favor a nice tidy Perl script myself)  would be used to <i>develop the laws of the nation directly from the information in the database</i>.  Periodically (once a year, say), new opinion polls would be sent out, and new laws developed from the updated database.  We would thus have a society whose self-updating legal system efficiently mirrors the hearts and minds of its constituent citizenry.  Eventually, as other countries see how just and benevolent our government had become, they too could be included in the system, until, like a tree growing outward to offer its life-giving fruit for the nourishment of all, the opinion poll-based legal system will extend to link all humankind in peace and justice (and Perl).  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
One thing I'd like to add, however, is that your computer program should be GPLed.  The working men and womyn of the world have learned that Commercial Software is immoral, and so they would not approve of the constitution software unless it is licensed under the GPL.
<BR><BR>
So here are the steps I'd like to take to create the Constitution.pl program:
<ul>
<li>Register the project on Sourceforge
<li>Do some preliminary development (version 0.0.1)
<li>Post it on Freshmeat.net
<li>"A million eyes make all bugs shallow"
<li>Allow members of the Community to submit patches and to change the program in whatever way they see fit (the "bazaar" model)
<li>Make a GTK widget for Constitution.pl.  And maybe a Gnome Panel applet.
<li>Integrate it into Gnutella to allow MP3s and bukakke movies to be downloaded with it.
</ul>
Constitution.pl will soon be the Linux of Constitutions!

The war on drugs is an affront to personal freedon. The usa government wants to make computer hackers, you know those harmless people who muck about with unsecured servers, equivelant to terrorists!!! The USA government, at the well paid urging of RIAA (cabal of record labels that want to squeeze more money from their music)to pass a law making it mandatory for ALL digital devices to have hardware built in to prevent copying copyrighted material. The USA has already made it illegal to circumvent copyright controls. If you legally buy a copyrighted work, but want to listen, watch, or read it on non-sanctioned hardware, you could go to jail for copying what you legally own. The freedom loving USA has already arrested a programmer who dared point how how lame the security controls were on Adobe's products, a Universty Prof was muzzled by this same law (he's trying to sue), and the USA pressured Dennmark into arresting a 16 year old kid who worked on a program to play DVD's on computers not sanctioned by the RIAA.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Yes but the criminial don't exact register guns no w do they?  I am all for restricting the TYPE of guns people can obtain.  Hunting rifle, hand guns, maybe even a shotgun.  However, I do not believe that people NEED bazookas.  I am aslo in favor of the fact that many states hold parents responsible for the children's actions.  "Hey why wasn't the gun hdden and SECURED?"
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;Seventh Amendment: In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
This guranteeing a persons rights to a trial by jury.  It means that at no time can a court deny this.  Many times jurors have found people to be innocent then new evidence finds the killer was someone else.  I know that if I were wrongly accused I would not want this right taken away.  It also states that if a jury finds you guilty you cannot recommend an appeal unless your right acording to the Constitution were denied.  Such as if a judge refuses to permit evidence that would have proven you innocent.  The twenty dollars has also been re-evaluated and inflation does play a role.  So it's really no longer $20.
<BR>

<BR>
The reasonn we don't call for a major overhaul is that it requires such a LARGE vote to even ammend a single portion if the document.  Also we would have to be guarenteed that the Bill of Rights remain in tact.  The are the life-blood of the Constitution.  Amendments which grants citizens of the US their God given rights, and all subsuquent amendments must adhere to these guidlines.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is precisely because of the Constitution that you are even able to post this document, so I find it quite interesting that you, who obviously have no concept of just how important the rights it grants really are, would be so against it. Allow me to elaborate.

<BR><BR>As concerns the First Amendment: Surely, we can agree that all people must be held equal before the law. But then, too, must all human thought be held equal before the law, because it is our capacity for thought which makes us human. Therefore, all human expression of thought, including speech, must be held equal, for is it by expression that thoughts propagate.

<BR><BR>Or, to put it another way, all ideas have a fundamental right to exist. Even those as reprehensible as racism. Racism in and of itself hurts no one, despicable as it might be. Racial violence certainly does hurt people, but this is already a crime, and thus there is no need for new laws about it. But the most important reason that all speech must be protected is this: <em>no human knows the truth. </em>We've all got it wrong, and yes, I do include myself in this. Everyone has a different viewpoint, because we're all individuals, and is is somewhere in between those viewpoints that the truth is found. So when you start restricting human thought, as you would do, you <em>permanently </em>cripple humanity's ability to accurately ascertain truth. Could anything be more criminal against humanity than that, to strangle the human mind? Just because <em>you </em>don't like something is not a license to destroy it.

<BR><BR>The Second Amendment: Perhaps the most poorly-worded amendment in the Constitution, but one of the most important. People seem to think that "regulated" means "organized." This is not so. If you look in dictionaries from then and now, you find that to "regulate" something is to hold it in control, to check its power to keep it from becoming too weak or too strong. This is the final check and balance in the system: the ability to revolt, should the government go corrupt. Of course, even this is checked: revolution is treason, so if you want to revolt, you'd better be able to win so you can pardon yourself, or you're screwed. And further, with the modern military, you have to have absolutely overwhelming popular support in order to have even the slimmest chance of winning. A good balance, I think.

<BR><BR>Also notable: in every single state that has passed a law allowing for concealed-weapons permits, violent crime has gone <em>down, </em>not up. Just another point for the plain and simple fact that an inanimate object does not cause violence, the person wielding it does. People are responsible for their own actions.

<BR><BR>And finally, the Seventh Amendment: Sure, trial by jury isn't that economical. That doesn't matter, because it is the only fair way to carry out a trial. Why? Because it is the people's check on the judiciary. Think about this. A judge is bound to uphold the law. This is in the job description. They can only act counter to the law when said law is unconstitutional. But a jury is under no such obligation. Even if a person has broken a law, a jury can refuse to convict if they find the law to be unfair. All of you living in Florida should be grateful for this, because if you've ever taken a bath indoors, you've committed a crime. But of course, no jury would convict you for it. A judge, though, would have to. It's their job.

<BR><BR>Study the Constitution. Think about how it applies to you. And for crying out loud, stop taking your rights for granted. The document was meant to be timeless, and this is for a good reason. Most people don't know enough to run a country; you don't, and neither do I. This is why most politicians started out as lawyers, to get the training they need to understand such things as laws and rights. My own understanding is rudimentary, but I realize why they're important, both for me and for those I oppose, like you.

<BR><BR>So keep on speaking. You're utterly wrong, but you have the right to speak. A shame you don't seem to realize that you threaten your own rights to do so, and should you have your way, might find yourself to be your own worst adversary.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I'd be happy to.

1.  Assume that no human knows the truth about morality.

2.  "No human knows the truth about morality" concerns morality.

<BR>
3.  Since we accepted "no human knows the truth about morality" as true, and it concerns morality, "no human knows the truth about morality" is therefore the truth about morality.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Therefore, because "no human knows the truth about morality" is the truth about morality, no human knows "no human knows the truth about morality."
<BR>

<BR>
5.  To have accepted "no human knows the truth about morality" in step #1, it was neccessary to know "no human knows the truth about morality."
<BR>

<BR>
6.  We have reached a contradiction.  According to #4, no human knows "no human knows the truth about morality," but in step #5, a human must know "no human knows the truth about morality."
<BR>

<BR>
7.  Because the accepted premise in step #1 led to a logical contradiction, the premise must be rejected.
<BR>

<BR>
8.  Therefore, "no human knows the truth about morality" is proven false.

Moral relativism has ALREADY been disproven as logically flawed DECADES ago, so I really wish you Liberals would stop dredging it up to support your paedophilia, or molestation of children, your smoking of pot, or whatever Liberal cause you're defending this week.
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  Wow, look at the supple buttocks of that 6-year-old child!  I think I'll rape that child.  Oh BOY, nothing warms my Liberal blood like a little childrape in the morning!
<BR>

<BR>
CHILD:  Oh NO, a Liberal!  My teacher warned me about Liberals -- he may try to rape me!  Help!  HELP!!
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  Ha ha ha!  There's no escape!
<BR>

<BR>
*Liberal rapes child, kills child, rapes child again*
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  We're going to have to criticize you for what you did, and possibly even punish you.
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  But we live in a morally ambiguous universe.  Isn't it arrogant for you to believe that things like "rape" and "murder" are wrong?  It would be wrong to criticize me because it's impossible to say what's right and wrong in this morally relativistic world.
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  So are you saying that rape and murder AREN'T wrong?
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  We human beings are just one thread in a vast tapestry woven by Holy Earth Mother Gaia.  To label rape and murder as "wrong" is to claim superiority to Holy Earth Mother Gaia!  We humans don't know the truth about morality!
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  Okay, fine.  So how about, for the next ten minutes, we pretend that rape and murder AREN'T wrong?
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  Err-- okay, I suppose.
<BR>

<BR>
*Society rapes Liberal*
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  Ouch!  My delicate Liberal anus!  Stop!
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  We're doing nothing wrong, remember?
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  I may have changed my mind about this--
<BR>

<BR>
*Society murders Liberal*
<BR>

<BR>
LIBERAL:  ...death........
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  WOW, he was RIGHT!  I don't feel guilty at ALL!
<BR>

<BR>
*Society digs a whole in "Holy Earth Mother Gaia" (also known as "the dirt") and dumps the bloodied corpse of Liberal into it.*
<BR>

<BR>
SOCIETY:  I wonder what's on television tonight.
<BR>

<BR>
And that's why I hate Liberals.

Neither is John Lott, the University of Chicago professor whose statistical analysis is probably the one to which you refer.
<BR>

<BR>
When discussing manipulated statistics, though, you can't go much farther than the anti-gun rights groups.   HCI's campaign against guns, ostensibly to protect children against death by gun accident, didn't have scary enough numbers.  So HCI expanded the definition of 'children' to 'under 25 years old' and expanded the definition of 'gun accident' to include 'children' shot by police while committing crimes.

<BR><BR>...and here, you miss the point entirely. That is not what I said. I said that, via their ability to protect themselves, the people themselves hold the military under control. THe military has to think twice about becoming oppressive, because if the people are armed, they can actually *gasp* <em>fight back. </em>That's what holding the militia under control means. Our government is a system of checks and balances. But not all of the checks can come from within the government. In ways such at this, the people and the government check each other.

<BR><BR>So a piece of paper stops a bullet, huh? That's news to me. I told you already, this isn't just about protection from rogue law enforcement, although that's certainly an important aspect of it. A mugger isn't going to be swayed when you whip out a copy of the Constitution. Not even when you roll it up and start smacking him with it. Even a few paper cuts isn't going to stop him, in fact, it'll probably just make him madder.
<BR><BR><i>That would have been the damn point for writing it and for instituting a liberal democracy where people without guns can tell people with guns where to stick them.</i>

<BR><BR><i>If that liberal democracy breaks down, what the fuck good is a gun?</i>
If that "liberal" democracy (noting that democracies are not inherently liberal or conservative) breaks down, then there is no law -at least temporarily- and that gun becomes pretty darned important if you don't want to get killed, raped, robbed, or whatever, at least until law is re-established.

<BR><BR>Then what is? Are not all weapons meant to be used in self-defense?
<BR><BR><i>More people shoot themselves by accident than they do their attackers in self-defense.</i>
<BR><BR>Irrelevant; guns are certainly not made to cause accidents. Some people are stupid, and don't store their guns properly; they bring those accidents upon themselves. It's a greater shame when a third party is involved, of course, but the one at fault is the one who stored it improperly, not the gun itself. A gun is a tool, no more, no less. It is how it is used that makes all the difference.
<BR><BR>A question, though: do you think people have a right to endanger themselves, if they so choose? Perhaps, say, via abusing drugs? If not, you're a hypocrite if the only reason you'd ban guns is to prevent gun accidents.
<BR><BR><i>I know a thing or two about violent situations and I can tell you such situations rarely unfold or present themselves like they do in the movies. In fact, people whose confidence depends on their gun are the very easiest people to mop the floor with.</i>
<BR><BR>True, true. Trust me, I know more than my share about violent situations myself. But at the same time, you're speaking of a mental state now, rather than a physical circumstance. Please try to stay on topic.
<BR><BR><i><b>...and then the people with guns shoot them. How can you not see this incredibly simple point?</b></i>
<BR><BR><i>Er, because I live in civilized society?</i>
<BR><BR>By whose definition?
<BR><BR><i>Look, your entire line of reasoning can be summed up like this: I distrust my community and prefer to live in a state of siege.</i>
<BR><BR>No. That's not it at all. I'm not naive enough to think that all the people in the world are good, kind people, and so I prefer to live on a level playing field so that should I run up against one, I am prepared.
<BR><BR><i>Bully for you. Have a nice life polishing your peashooter.</i>
<BR><BR>I already told you; I neither own nor want to own a gun. I have my own ways of protecting myself and those I love. But as I also told you, those means are not commonly available to most. For those who cannot get them, another viable means of self-defense is needed. Ergo, my belief that the Second Amendment is important.
<BR><BR><i><b>No, but you'll notice the coup that precipitated its collapse was carried out by the military. People with guns.</b></i>
<BR><BR><i>Well, connect the dots. The US also has a military composed of people who might be your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, and your next door neighbors.</i>
<BR><BR>You're correct in some of those cases. But I can also say that the military is also composed of a huge number of  people who are <em>not </em>my mother, father, brother, sister, or next door neighbors.
<BR><BR><i>Furthermore, why do you believe US society consists of a monolithic "leadership" whose tyrannical rule will be unquestioned if and when the shit hits the fan?</i>
<BR><BR>It is true that the leadership is not ordinary monolithic. But certainly, given the right circumstances, it can be manipulated to act as such. Consider the September 11 attacks as the perfect example.
<BR><BR><i>Why evidence do you have that well armed private "militias" arent the greater danger?</i>
<BR><BR>I have none. And certainly, private "militias" can be dangerous. Just look at what one of them did to a certain building in Oklahoma City for proof of that. But I never advocated militia groups, now did I?
<BR><BR><i>Historically, they are; nothing good has ever come from a citizenry convinced of the false certainty of their "oppression" by what we historically refer to as scapegoats.</i>
<BR><BR>Well, let's see... what about the United States government itself? Was it not founded in just such a manner?
<BR><BR>Well, to be more accurate, I'd suppose I'd have to say it was the original Articles of Confederation that was drafted by that group (though the Framers shared many members with them). But I think you see my point here. The US was founded by people who were able to rise up against a corrupt government when the need arose.
<BR><BR>You know, come to think of it, the same is true for the French government. And if you want to go back really far, the English government as we know it isn't all that different.
<BR><BR><i>You appear to favor cartoon fantasies of the nature of governance and its revolt that simply arent corroborated in history.</i>
Even if I am, you're the same as me. Granted, I may be watching <em>Power Rangers </em>while you're watching <em>Care Bears, </em>but your naivete is every bit as screwed up as my paranoia.
<BR><BR>I am not trying to advocate that my way is the way things ought to be. It would be a wonderful thing if your perfect world existed where everyone was happy all the time and no one ever wanted to hurt anyone else. But that world does not exist. This is reality I'm talking about. The day you can convince everyone else in the entire world, including all governments, corporations, and extragovernmental organizations, to disarm completely and destroy all plans to any weapon that was ever made, then I will retract everything i've said here. Until then, it's not safe to do so.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>The US was founded by people who were able to rise up against a corrupt government when the need arose. </i>
<BR><BR>
The staggering, overwhelming mass of people in whose name  *every* single revolution in history was fought was singularly unarmed with anything other than pointy sticks.

No 2nd Amendment protects you now or protected anyone in the history of Mankind from tyranny. Finally, you continue to resist the almost axiomatic quality of the proposition at the root of this discussion:

civil society and the original American civil society in particular never, <i>never</i>, <b>never</b> assigned any civil rights to an artifact of metallurgy capable of inaccurately spitting out a projectile at several hundred feet per second. 
<BR><BR>
We already know that weapons exist and will be useful in a revolt whether some of us own them now or will buy them surreptitiously for the purpose of arming the very few people whose names will pollute future folk tunes with their owners' mythical courage. I'm pleased to agree with all that and more. Now, what argument do you have that the 2nd is a personal Constitutional Right to arm oneself against a tyrannical taxman?

<BR><BR>They can try. They won't win, of course, but they can try. A successful revolution takes a group effort of course, and moreover it takes a really large group effort. But never forget that at its heart, even the largest group is made up of individuals.
<BR><BR><i>You seem willing to concede every argument with the purpose of making the rhetorical point that people will shoot their way out of the arguments' conclusions, as if people will win a revolution without the support and organization of mutinous armies.</i>

<BR><BR>Agreed. But the discussion seems to have trailed off into <em>why </em>this right is a necessary one. This naturally gets into the nature of guns, and wewapons in general.
<BR><BR><i>We already know that guns can be useful and that people should and are allowed to own useful things. I am of the opinion that the purchase of a gun should be a much more difficult transaction than the purchase of a driving license, for example, not that gun ownership should be strictly illegal.</i>
<BR><BR>Well, frankly, I don't think getting a driving license should be nearly as easy as it is here anyway, but I digress.
<BR><BR>In any case, I would tend to agree with you, although I think our implementations of this would be different. I see mandatory gun-safety classes as a good way to start with this. Once someone completes the course with high enough marks (and I think those marks ought to be quite strict, certainly no less than the equivalent of a B and I would prefer an A), they're presented with a certificate or something similar. That certificate must in turn be presented to a gun shop when a purchase is made. Basically, i'm talking about certification, rather than full-on licensing.
<BR><BR><i>The problem with popular interpretations of the 2nd Amendment is that they breed false consciousness and a withdrawl from citizenship in favor of paranoid, ineffectual fantasies that seek to fulfill their own prophesies.</i>
<BR><BR>I fail to see how this is the case. Please define "citizenship" as you used it there.
<BR><BR><i>After all, if you think your gun protects you from tyranny, you are content to dismiss government with casual sentiments that amount to "well, they'll get theirs in the end, and if in the meantime they come onto my property, they better know how to dance around bullets."</i>
<BR><BR>Some people certainly do think that. Most don't. There are other things that one needs protection from, you know. In the case of most gun owners, government never enters their minds when you ask them what they need protection from. And that's good; it means things are going smoothly at the moment, all things considered. But it is naive to think that just because things are going smoothly now, that they always will.
<BR><BR><i>Now this is a popular American sentiment, but it is nevertheless completely, historically inaccurate in its misrepresentation of Federalism and the original Federalist philosophy of governance.</i>
<BR><BR>There's a set of documents out there called the Federalist Papers. They were written by some of the Framers, in the years following the drafting of the Constitution. Very interesting reading, those; they give you a lot of insight into what they were trying to do. This is why constitutional lawyers study them along with the Constitution itself.
<BR><BR><i>More importantly -- because who cares what the Framers thought or said 250 years ago -- it is an uncritical, moral fantasy unrecognizable from reality.</i>
<BR><BR>Um, I think you need to check your wording there. If it's unrecognizable from reality, that means it's so close to reality as to seem identical.
<BR><BR>Nevertheless, I catch your drift. Though I don't see any reasoning to back up your claim.

<i>There's a set of documents out there called the Federalist Papers. </i>
<BR><BR>
So? There's nothing in the Federalist Papers that actually argues  for an individual's Constitutional Right to own weapons. There is a tendency in gun advocates to divest ancient quotes from their justification in militia contexts. 
<BR><BR>
<i>And has it ever occurred to you that every once in a while, someone who said something a long time ago might actually have been right?
</i>
<BR><BR>
You are arguing messages you believe to be latent in the text rather than the text itself. I'll make my own logical inferences, thank you very much, and in the meantime, 
your hope in this debate is to convince me of the truth of what I know damn well was <i>not</i> said.
<BR><BR>
Again, I dont care about your permission to  own guns any more than I care about your  common law privilege to own Anthrax or stuffed bears. What I care about is why you think Anthrax and stuffed bears can be regulated  to a greater extent than guns?

<BR><BR>Let's start with one quote:

<BR><BR>"The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed." -Thomas Jefferson.

<BR><BR>Or this little gem from John Adams:
<BR><BR>"Arms in the hands of citizens (may) be used at individual discretion...in private self defense..." -John Adams, <cite>A defense of the Constitutions of the Government of the USA, </cite>471 (1788).

<BR><BR>I won't deny the bits about election results and the amount of money the NRA spends on campaign contributions (note: I am not a member of the NRA).

<BR><BR>How's about the Constitution itself? Or, to be more precise, the second amendment: "the right of the people to keep and bear arms <em>shall not be infringed" </em>(emphasis mine) The phrase preceding it was a rather poorly-worded attempt at justifying it, one which perhaps shouldn't have been left in there.
<BR><BR><i>JUST ONE.</i>

<BR><BR>You have this fetish with capitalizing the word ONE, I see. It really ruins the effect. By the way, I've provided several, or is the Constitution not allowed to speak in its own defense?
<blockquote><BR><BR>To suppose arms in the hands of citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense or by partial orders of towns...is a dissolution of the government.</blockquote>
<BR><BR><i>Get it? He is arguing against you...</i>
<BR><BR>Um, didn't you see what he said? "...except in private self-defense or by partial orders of towns." That says nothing about merely owning or carrying a weapon. Simply the uses to which it should be legally limited. It should be noted that uses of these weapons not listed here are <em>already </em>illegal, as they should be. So there is no need for further legislation.
<BR><BR>By the way, you only gave a partial quote. Where is the rest of it? I'd also like to see some context into which to put it.
<BR><BR><i>...you disingenuous, clueless fucking liar. Fuck, you gun shitheads make me sick.</i>
<BR><BR>Resorting to <i>ad hominem </i>attacks, I see. No offense, but it makes you look like you're desperate to find something to say.

<BR><BR>-- Federalist 46</blockquote>
<BR><BR>Obviously out of context; for example, what are "these" to which this militia would be opposed? Also, what does this have to do with the right to keep and bear arms? All it provides for is a military organization.
<BR><BR><i>I've had it. I will not waste one second replying to any series of irrelevant, mincing words you post...</i>
<BR><BR>Sorry to see you go. I do think it's a shame your arguments degenerated into flames before you left, though. I wish we had been able to keep this civil.
<BR><BR>Although it does illustrate one of my points fairly well. I didn't agree with you. It made you mad. Mad enough that you threw some very serious insults my way. From your tone, it would seem that had we been talking face to face much longer, you would have gone violent in your rage. Where is your "civilized" society, then? If an intelligent person like yourself can't even stay civil with someone who disagrees with you, then does that not simply underscore the need for an effective means by which people can defend themselves?
<BR><BR><i>except to repeat my single demand: Cite one legally enforceable opinion concluding the 2nd is an individual's Constitutional right.</i>
<BR><BR>It's right there in the Constitution itself. Plain and simple. In the phrase "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed" there are only two words longer than one syllable: "people" and "infringed". Both of these words are very clearly defined. What is so hard to understand about this?
<BR><BR><i>If you cannot do that (you cannot) cite one instance ANYWHERE in the ENTIRE American testament tbat refers to guns as an individual Constitutional Right.</i>
<BR><BR>If I cannot do it... then what? You're not even talking in coherent sentences anymore. Are you truly that angry at me?
<BR><BR><i>I am NOT interested in isolated, context free, inaccurately cited quotations that evoke tears in the eyes of gun goons.</i>
<BR><BR>So am I. Please stop using them.
<BR><BR><i>I am well aware that quotations by your saintly Framers rival the bible in their ability to "demonstrate" anything and everything when brandished in the negligent, intellectually dishonest manner you have demonstrated in common with your fellowship of fools.</i>
<BR><BR>Those are very serious, and very baseless, accusations.
<BR><BR>As I said before, I hope there are no hard feelings. I intended this to be an honest debate, but it seems my opponents have gotten carried away. I apologize for angering anyone, if I have in fact done so. But I stand by what I have said.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

That said, they did a remarkably good job under the circumstances.  And it's much easier to build on an existing agreement than to start from scratch.  So we have this agreement.  And people more or less take it seriously and try and relate what they do to it.  That itself is some kind of miracle.  So don't knock it.  And fly the flag 'n' shit.  God bless America.

One could get the impression that Americans don't really believe in those things; why else try to convince each other by repeating them all the time? <BR><BR>

I agree - the American constitution does indeed need to be rewritten from scratch. It is simply too old and written in a style that doesn't allow for real amendments. But I don't think you Americans believe enough in freedom etc to dare change it. <BR><BR>

This is one of the things that make me feel that America is in for a very serious downturn. Just look at yourselves: your impossible electoral system has landed you with a president who is ignorant, possibly of low intelligence and who claims that God wants him to go to Afganistan and kill Injuns, sorry Muslims, I mean terrorists. And isn't it also your constitution that makes sure that you have a corrupt political and court system
where money can buy political power and 'justice'? <BR><BR>

I'm sorry to say this - but America is not a 'great' country in any sense except the geographical and miltary ones. You have the potential, though, and believe me, there's nothing I'd like better than seeing America turn into a great country. <BR><BR>

So why isn't America great? Need I mention: ruthless and dishonest politicians (domestic and foreign), greedy companies (which is another political issue), apparent lack of respect for environment and for other cultures; and an entrenched unwillingness to listen to criticism, however gentle. These are harsh words; I am perfectly willing to expand on them, if asked to, but I don't want to write a long and tedious rant here, as I don't expect a lot of you to agree. <BR><BR>

It has been said by many that a truly great person is gentle, not ruthless, truthful, not false, modest rather than stupidly boasting of his/her qualities whether they are imagined or not. It would be nice, if America were a great nation.
