		Gun politics is always a hot-button topic for debate here in these United States of America.  Those who defend the pro-gun lifestyle like to claim that there is nothing wrong with it, that it is a basic and fundamental part of our national heritage.  They like to claim that "the truth" about guns is nothing to be feared, and that "the truth" is that gun owners are just plain folks, no different from the decent families who work hard and raise their children in a nurturing environment.<p>

But the truth is far from comforting.  The truth is terrible.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">The <a href="http://www.mynra.com/">National Rifle Association</a> (NRA) is the flagship organization of the gun crazies.  It claims to be an organization of law-abiding Americans who are doing more than defending their Second Amendment right to keep and bear firearms.  However, the truth about the NRA is far from benign; the truth is frightening.  They are a group of sociopaths with a clear agenda: unlimited gun proliferation at all costs, human and otherwise.  They have not one iota of human compassion or feeling; their devotion to their implements of death knows no bounds.<p>

For example, the NRA was scheduled to hold its 1999 annual meeting in Colorado.  However, in the wake of the horrible mass school shooting at <a href="http://www.spiritofcolumbine.org/">Columbine</a>, many people in Colorado pleaded with the NRA to hold its meeting elsewhere.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9905/01/school.shooting.01/">They refused</a>.  And when the venerable Charlton Heston (the NRA's president) addressed the crowd in Denver, did he have words of regret and remorse for the tragic events?  None could be found.  Instead, the NRA and the gun industry <a href="http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/30/gun.ads/">expressed concern</a> that the tragedy might hurt their image.  In other words, the NRA was deeply saddened by the events at Columbine .. not because they particularly cared about the loss of so many innocent lives, but because they thought that they would end up "looking bad."<p>

The post-Columbine insensitivity is bad enough, but the NRA has also announced its intention to lobby Congress to get <a href="http://kfmb.cbsnow.com/now/story/0,1597,193663-274,00.shtml">gun indoctrination</a> as a part of the standard public education curriculum for every K-6 student in the country.  What Heston apparently fails to grasp is that the majority of children in this country are raised by decent, responsible, and loving parents, and that these children have about as much need for "gun education" as a fish has for a bicycle.  Heston's <a href="http://www.chickenhead.com/features/nrakids/">"dream America"</a> might be a country where bullets are zipping through the air like mosquitoes and children are shooting each other dead on the playground for their lunch money, but rational Americas do not share these views.<p>

By far, the most inexcusable acts of the NRA are its opposition to bans on assault rifles and Teflon-coated <a href="http://www.saneguns.org/gunlobby/nra_cops.html">cop-killer bullets</a>.  With regards to assault rifles, they have a sole purpose: <i>to kill people.</i>  You don't take an AR-15 out with you to go duck hunting.  You won't need an Uzi submachinegun and a truckload of 9mm clips to go deer hunting.  The defense of the cop-killer bullets (so named because they are designed to penetrate the Kevlar vests worn by policemen) is simply inhuman; it astounds me that a million people are proud to call themselves members of an organization that advocates the violent murder of police officers who have sworn their lives to the defense of the innocent.<p>

So if the gun owners' main organization is so vile, so completely devoid of worth, surely the individual gun owners <i>themselves</i> must have some redeeming characteristics, no?  After all, there <i>must be</i> some <i>good</i> news, right?<p>

I'm afraid not:<p>

<ul>
<li> Gun owners are <a href="http://www.natreformassn.org/thfools.html">dangerously religious</a>.  I want you to think about this for a minute.  Let's say you get into an argument with a gun owner in line at the supermarket.  What's to stop him from pulling out a concealed handgun, blowing your head off, getting your home address from your driver's license, going there and murdering your wife and young children, and then taking his own life?  Remember, these people believe that all they have to do is "make their peace with the lord and call him savior" and they will be immediately delivered to eternal bliss.<p>

It seems to me that decent Americans with families have much to fear from this mentality.  These people believe there is nothing they can do that will prevent them from an eternity of pleasure with a lord.  That includes the cold-blooded murder of young children.<p>

<li> <a href="http://www.bradycampaign.org/press/1999/hci/110999.html">Alcoholism</a> among gun owners occurs at <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cas/test/guns/guns_collegerpt.shtml">disproportionately high rates</a>.  This should be a source of concern to people who are concerned about the safety of their children.  The gun crazies like to say that "guns don't kill people, people kill people."  This apparently represents the crowning achievement in philosophy for the gun crazies, and even I will admit that there is a shred of truth to it.  I would point out, however, that it's a lot easier for people to kill people if they've been out behind the woodshed guzzling "Grandpa's cough syrup" all day.<p>

When I take my children to see a movie, the last thing I need to see is a disheveled malcontent, staggering down the street, bib overalls reeking of moonshine and cigarette smoke, barely able to stand up.  When that malcontent is armed with an implement of death, what was previously a public nuisance has suddenly become a serious public threat.  There is no reason that a decent society should tolerate this sort of behavior, and that fact that we do is a sad commentary on our nation.<p>

<li> The link between gun owners and <a href="http://www.militia-watchdog.org/">far-right militias</a> is both undeniable and scary.  These self-described "freedom fighters" are on the public record as saying that they will kill as many innocent women and children as is necessary to "reclaim their God-given rights."  Apparently, these groups are fighting for their God-given right to kill women and children, since it is not obvious what other "rights" these lunatics are being denied.  These militia groups are overwhelmingly racist and have expressed desires to "cleanse" the country (and indeed, the entire planet) of all persons who are not White, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant.<p>

This is the face of the American gun nut.<p></ul>

Don't fall into the trap.<p>

These people are hiding behind a smokescreen of false patriotism and "strict constructionist" interpretations of the United States Constitution. But the truth about the average American gun owner is that he is a slobbering fundamentalist alcoholic who would rather shoot you dead than shake your hand.  These are people that would rather commit acts of terrorism against their homeland than work within the legal confines of the system to get their message out.  These are people who have stockpiles of .50 caliber rifles ready to aim at the heads of our own armed services.  They are a violent and traitorous bunch; they spit on the graves of <i>true</i> American patriots, and we cannot afford to be complacent and ignore them.<p>

If ever there was a time in our history to enact <i>true</i> sensible gun control, it is <b>right now</b>.  This is still a battle we can win, but if we pretend that this threat doesn't exist, this country will go to hell in a handbasket.  One day we'll wake up in a world that resembles <i>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</i> and we'll wonder what happened.  And you know what I'll say?  <b>"Far be it from me to say 'I told you so.'"</b><p>

The fact of the matter is that the United States Constitution is not written in stone, and those who claim that it <i>is</i> are conveniently forgetting the fact that the Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, gave us a process by which it can be amended.  Furthermore, because the amendment process is so convoluted and drawn out, all that we <i>really</i> need is a majority opinion from the United States Supreme Court.  The Second Amendment, much like the GPL, has never had its validity fully-tested in the judicial system.  When that day comes, I am confident that it and the imagined "rights" that it affords will be exposed as the murderous shams that they are.<p>

At some point, the forces of morality and reason in this country will have the critical mass that is necessary to abolish the Second Amendment. The only question is .. how many more school massacres and Charlton Heston speeches ("from my cold, dead hands") will it take before people finally see the light?  The <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~delores../../images/">gun crazies</a> will fight us tooth and nail, but we will fight back, and <i>we will win</i>.      <br><br></div>

So taking away a gun from a small dicked Usian is tantamouint to emsaculating him and thus the howls of outcry it produces. <BR>

Only countries with males who are secure about their dick size tend to ban guns for example the UK.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The European emigrants were hardly <i>forced</i> to leave.  Rather, they made a conscious decision to get out--Europe was quickly falling to root-snorting new-age european homosexuals.  The small penises rumor was simply started by European flamers  trying to come up with a valid way to cope with rejection.

The "ban" on assault rifles really keeps people from purchasing certain rifles and other longarms that are more suitable for hunting game than crowds of people.<BR>
<BR>
Teflon coated cop killer bullets?  You don't need some fancy round to penetrate body armor.  A .357 or .44 magnum can go right through a kevlar vest.  I've heard that even .22's have enough power that with careful aim, any protection worn is useless.<BR>
<BR>
Gun owners are likely to be alchoholics, you say.  I can turn that around and say alchohlics are likely to own guns.  Let's ban alchohol.  It would stop people from buying guns.<BR>
<BR>
Gun nuts.  Gun crazies.  What ignorant terms.  Well here's a quote from someone you'd call a gun nut:  "A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun, therefore, be the constant companion of your walks."  This quote is attributed to Thomas Jefferson, one of the fathers of our country.  To him games that use balls like basketball or bowling or golf are much more violent than the proper use of a firearm, an idea that any intelligent man would strongly agree with.<BR>
<BR>
The second amendment has been tested many times.  It says that citizens of the US should be allowed to have firearms for protection within and without the US.  Education and target practice are all you need to protect yourself from the hoodlums that would rather play with balls than learn the finer points of windage, grain size, and iron sights.<BR>
<BR>
If you think that you are safe because of the police, think again.  Ask any cop and they will tell you that if you are in a life and death situation without protection, they will happily come by to draw a white chalk outline around you when they arrive.  The police are the cleanup crew.  They may catch the guy who shot/stabbed you for the $4 and Subway stamps in your wallet, but you're still dead.  How dare you put your loved ones through the emotional and financial trauma of a funeral and burial just because you thought you were morally correct.  I guess you think your beliefs are more important than your family.<BR>
<BR>
You end your misguided tirade with yet another mention of school shootings.   If one of the teachers had been properly trained in firearms and allowed to keep one on his/her person, only one person would have died:  the morally bankrupt individual who wanted to hurt his/her classmates.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I see.  So the Columbine incident presented a potential financial hardship to the NRA.  Poor, poor, NRA.  I mean, how can these people be bothered to consider the feelings of grieving parents if it means that they might end up losing money?  What a bunch of savages.<BR><BR>

Your post does nothing but reinforce the terrible truth about gun owners; namely, that you are obsessed with implements of death and will not stop until five-year olds are shooting each other dead in the streets over arguments about a hopscotch game.<BR><BR>

<i>Gun education is important. Kids need to respect and understand the power of a gun.</i><BR><BR>

The hell they do.  I am a loving and responsible parent, and I care for the safety of my children.  I do not own guns.  My children will not go within <i>ten feet</i> of a gun.  Because I am a responsible parent and I love my children, I do everything in my power to keep them out of situations that can result in harm to them.  This <i>especially</i> includes situations that involve guns.  The overwhelming majority of child gun deaths are a result of being shot by friends or family within their own home. The standard position of the gun crazies is that murder of children is perfectly acceptable so long as the Second Amendment is not challenged.  I mean, what are these Columbine parents crying about?  They're just kids! An hour or so in the missionary position can make another one that looks similar to the one that fell in the glorious battle for our "firearm rights."<BR><BR>

*spit*<BR><BR>

The amount of sheer hatred that the average gun owner has towards children is astounding.  It is absolutely astounding.  Sure, I know; when a child is shot dead by a gun, it is the work of "the lord" and we should not question the lord since he works in mysterious ways, but he wants us to be as heavily armed as possible.  Jesus tapdancing Christ.<BR><BR>

<i>The second amendment has been tested many times.</i><BR><BR>

Wrong.  The Second Amendment has never been tested in front of the United States Supreme Court.  When "George" Dubya Bush is voted out of office in 2004 because of his support of environmental destruction and his extremist fundamentalist stances, his Democratic successor will be in a position to nominate at least two Supreme Court justices that will guarantee the abolishment of the Second Amendment.  Good riddance to bad rubbish, I say.<BR><BR>

I hope that CNN and Fox News and ABC and all of the news outlets broadcast live feeds from the destruction of the guns once they are criminalized.  We'll have trash compactors reducing the guns to pieces of unrecognizable metal.  The death-worshipping guns nuts will be watching TV, tears streaming down their cheeks, shrieking "OUR GUNS! OUR GUNS!"  Their children will ask them what time supper is, and they will backhand them across the face and shout "DON'T TALK BACK TO ME!  THEY'RE DESTROYING OUR GUNS!"<BR><BR>

<i>If you think that you are safe because of the police, think again.</i><BR><BR>

It comes as no surprise that you take this position, because you advocate the murder of peace officers by your support of cop-killing bullets.  Oh yeah, that's right; they're just for "hunting."  Give me a break.  The reason that the NRA advocates killing as many police officers as possible is that the very <i>presence</i> of police officers completely shoots holes (no pun intended) through their entire justification for owning guns.  "We need to protect ourselves!  And we can't protect ourselves if the police are continually being killed by these cop-killer bullets, which we support, by the way." <BR><BR>

As a law-abiding citizen, I find the murder of police officers to be repugnant.  These are decent men, many of which have families of their own.  You consider them to be valueless casualties in your war to accumulate as much killing power as possible.  May God have mercy on your soul.<BR><BR>

<i>If one of the teachers had been properly trained in firearms and allowed to keep one on his/her person, only one person would have died: the morally bankrupt individual who wanted to hurt his/her classmates.</i><BR><BR>

Ahh, yes.  Let's strap holsters on our teachers and arm them with six-shooters.  Yee-haw!  What a wonderful environment for our children to learn in.  If Billy misbehaves, Mr. Jenkins can put a bullet between his eyes!  You people are out of your fucking minds, and you represent the single greatest threat to a decent society that this country has ever known.  If you have children, I sincerely hope that they are taken from you before you do them permanent harm or prematurely end their lives.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I don't think you understand.  My family does not own guns.  My children do not play with guns.  They are not allowed to play at or around the homes of known or suspected gun owners.  I repeat: <i>moral children raised by moral people have as much use for gun education as a fish has for a bicycle.</i>  Sure, if you live in Whiskey Lick, Wyoming and run the kind of house where you've got firearms laying carelessly scattered around all over the place, then children <i>should</i> be taught about guns, if only that they should stay as far away from them as possible.  But you are mistaking your hellish household for the kind of environment that is provided by <i>responsible</i> parents.<BR><BR>

<i>I can see you have no intention of having a rational discussion since you are totally incapable of doing so.</i><BR><BR>

Sorry, but a discussion that includes advocating arming schoolteachers with sidearms is incapable of being rational.  You've not left me much to work with.  Gun nuts have a lot of crazy positions, but arming teachers is the craziest of them.  I was listening to the Michael Reagan (an arch-conservative) talk show one night, and when one of his callers expressed this desire (arming teachers), Reagan <i>himself</i> called the idea crazy.  If you've got <i>Michael Reagan</i> thinking you're nuts, you must really be off the deep end.<BR><BR>

I don't understand why gun crazies don't want to stop school shootings.  Your focus is never on stopping the shootings; instead, it is always on <i>shooting first</i>.  "Try to shoot up the cafeteria, kids!  We'll take your head off before you can squeeze out three rounds!"  To be true, two dead children are preferable to seventeen dead children, but the point that moral people are trying to make .. hold on to your hats .. is that <i>no</i> dead children is better still!  Yet for some reason the gun zealots find this notion to be hateful; at least one dead child <i>must</i> be the result.  The mind boggles.

<i>In every country that has banned guns recently, gun crime has gone up. The people can't protect themselves, so they're just easy targets for criminals.</i><BR><BR>

References, please.  And I don't mean some isolated "World Net Daily" article that discusses some isolated, outlandish gun crime in Australia.  I'm looking for hard government statistics that demonstrate that crime -- <i>gun crime</i> -- has increased, in <i>every</i> country where guns are "banned."  While you're doing that, you might ponder the wonderful effects that guns have had on the per capita murder rate here in the US .. a murder rate that is six times higher than that of Great Britian and five times higher than Australia's.  And it's interesting to note that the gun-loving state of Texas has a murder rate that is nearly triple that of "godless, gunless" Massachussetts.<BR><BR>

I am aware that it is considered hateful to point these truths out, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  The nice thing about Internet anonymity is that it enables people to speak the truth to gun nuts without placing our families in danger of rage-induced retribution.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><i>When not using them (meaning at a gun range firing at targets), my weapons are kept locked in individual boxes which are then locked in a combination safe. Thanks for making all sorts of assumptions about me.</i><BR><BR>

I should not have suggested that your home was in the manner that I described, and I do apologize for that.  However, the fact remains that many inferior-class households in the Midwest and South <i>do</i> exhibit this kind of irresponsible parenting, and that is a real problem.  I commend you on keeping your guns safely out of your children's hands (if you have any; you didn't say.)  However, I am left wondering how your firearms can be used "in a pinch" to defend yourself if you are required to go through such a byzantine and convoluted procedure to even <i>get</i> to them.<BR><BR>

This is the biggest problem with the "guns as defense" argument.  Unlocked and accessible guns invariably result in dead children, and tightly-locked guns are all but useless in the hypothetical situations where their services could be handy.  One comes to the logical conclusion that if they cannot be properly used when properly stored, then they have no useful purpose whatsoever and it would be better to be rid of them altogether.<BR><BR>

<i>When someone wants to get a gun and start shooting innocents, he will find a way to make it happen ..</i><BR><BR>

.. unless there <i>are no guns available</i>, in which case he's up S**t Creek.  I suppose he could take a baseball bat or a shovel to school, but it's much easier for moral children to escape an insane shovel-wielder than it is to escape an armed lunatic who's spraying the gymnasium with gunfire .. not to mention the fact that it would be a trivial manner for the police to force his surrender.<BR><BR>

<i>And that claim wouldn't make would-be assassins think twice?</i><BR><BR>

Maybe I'm being trolled here, but I simply cannot see how repeatedly threatening children with violent death is going to produce an environment that is conducive to learning.  "Remember, children," says Mr. Jenkins as he pulls open his coat and points at his holster, "I'm <i>packing!</i>"  This type of environment in our schools would be more at home in a Stephen King horror novel than it would be in the ideal environment for education.<BR><BR>

Personally, I think the answer to people who want heavily-armed teachers is completely obvious: homeschooling.  That way, since <i>they themselves</i> are the teachers, they can arm themselves to the teeth and make whatever threats they feel to be appropriate.  If people want to strap grenades across their chest and blow off toes one-by-one every time Billy gets the wrong answer on his multiplication flash cards, then <i>fine</i>.  But they should do it to <i>their</i> children, not mine.  The day that my children come home with missing toes is the day that some psycho goes to jail.<BR><BR>

The biggest problem with this argument is that you seem to think that threats of violence are some sort of deterrent.  Well, they're not; my previously cited statistics on the murder rate work just as well to prove that such threats (in this case, the death penalty) are all but useless. When the United States, whose federal and state governments slaughter people in front of live audiences left and right, has a per capita murder rate that is six times that of England, which does not carry out a death penalty, the whole deterrent argument quickly falls apart.<BR><BR>

Regarding your links, the first one (the Australian one) actually contradicts your position by admitting that firearm-related deaths have declined since the Aussie gun control legislation was enacted!  As for the England article, the gun violence that it speaks of is cyclical and (as the article points out) nearly always related to drug trafficking.  Since moral people do not engage in drug transactions, the relevance of this statistic to the general population is tenuous at best.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I live far away in New Zealand and yes we have private ownership of guns.  However it is very time consuming, difficult and expensive to get a gun in New Zealand, and when you do you cannot own a pistol, automatic weapon, or even have a magazine that holds more than 15 rounds.  When you apply for a licence you must attend a firearms safety course run at a local police station, pass a written exam and then pass a police interview in your home.  A family member and another nominated referee will then be interviewed to give their opinions on your suitability of gun ownership and finally if you have proven that you have a real purpose to own a gun you will be given a licence to do so.  However the need to own a gun extends only for "game hunting purposes" or membership to a gun club for competitive shooting (like they have in the olympics).  When you finally purchase a rifle it nust be stored in a locked cabinet and the bolt and ammunition stored in another locked cabinet (all of which the police inspect).  I personally own a rifle for the purpose of deer hunting and i believe the laws relating to gun ownership are not at all onerous.  In New Zealand now gun ownership is a highly regulated privilage and guess what, we don't have a problem with gun violence, we respect the potential danger of guns and we don't have half the problems that you folks have in the states.<BR>
<BR>
So the point is that you could clean up gun laws in the US, get rid of automatic weapons pistols etc, and still have controlled gun use for the enthusiast.  You constantly talk of the need for guns for personal protection.  Well if this is the case then i pity you all then.  In New Zealand no citizen needs a military style gun, thats the way it is and that is the way it wil stay.<BR>

Sorry, every single decisions ending on appeal upto and including the Supreme Court has ruled against the Standard Theory. This is considered a matter of settled law and the Supreme Court has rejected  every 2nd Amendment challenge brought before it since 1936. Not surprisingly, the NRA has never, not once, fought gun control on the basis of Second <i>in court</i>. It simply manipulates public opinion and rewards friendly congressmen.

The gun lobby generally is filled with some very questionable people. Largely fundamentalists or survivalists. There's something unnerving about anyone who collects large quanities of firearms to me.

Of course, outlawing things in America has never really proven very effective at stopping people from getting and using them and instead has created lots of organized cartels of crime, so let's stick with that 2nd amendmant and keep the Columbians from providing our guns as opposed to legal distributoers even though the gun lobby are some fucked up scary folks.

That is just the first of the many lies, half truths and moronic statements you've made. I think your "article" is more aptly titled "The Terrible Things I'm About to Say About Law Abiding Citizens". <BR>
<BR>
I wonder where you're getting all your facts. I know that FBI statistics show that law-abiding gun owners with permits have the lowest rates of crime (any crime... that includes both violent and non-violent) of any group in the country. Law abiding citizens do not brandish their weapons in public places (re: your bible bashing statement) because that is a crime. Criminals aren't legally permitted to own or possess guns, so those 18 year old punks who may pull out a gun in public are not the types of folks we're defending here. <BR>
<BR>
Statistics show that in countries where private citizens are stripped of firearms, gun crime ... well ALL crime... goes up dramatically. Look at the United Kingdom (Great Britain, England, etc). They stripped guns out of everyone's homes and their crime hasn't gone down... it's gone up! An unarmed citizen is a victim waiting to happen. <BR>
<BR>
According to FBI statistics (see how i give a SOURCE for my statements? That's what makes them verifiable facts!) Maryland has one of the highest crime rates of any state in the nation. Coincidentally, they have the strictest provisions on private ownership of firearms. Vermont and New Hampshire have the most lenient of gun laws... and surprise surprise they have the lowest crime rates in the nation. <BR>
<BR>
How would i protect the public from crime? I'd lessen gun laws, and start running the country with a bit more common sense. <BR>
<BR>
That's not just my opinion, or a rant, it's the TRUTH. Look it up. <BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I've never understood why anyone would want to take guns away from people.  I'm relatively certain that I'm talking to a brick wall when I post this, but I'm going to go ahead and do so anyway in hope that someone somewhere might read it and experience what is sometimes known as a paradigm shift.<BR>
<BR>
It was Mao who said that political power comes from the barrel of a gun.  He was a communist dictator, but who better than a dictator to understand the nature and source of power.  The reason for the second amendment is to preserve freedom.  The second amendment puts power directly into the hands of the people, where it belongs.  In the 18th century your average rifle was a military grade munition.  An army might have cannon and calvary, but a group of people with nothing more than some guns and ammo could put up a significant fight even against well armed professional soldiers.  The American revolution proved that.  <BR>
The desire of some to disarm us and do away with the second amendment does not exist in a vacuum, but is part of a much greater problem.  That problem is how we define our nation and its government.  This country was founded upon the principle that our govnernment derives its authority from our consent to be governed by it, and that it is we as citizens who have the ultimate authority.  The mindset was that people had rights independent of the government that were inherent to being human.  Something has changed though.  Today the mindset is such that many people see the government as the ultimate authority and see rights as a kind of indlugence by the government.  Whereas I see the bill of rights as a declaration and acknowledgement of pre-existing rights, they see it as a list of rights that only exist because the government gives them to us.  The real question here is, are you as an individual person sovereign unto yourself, or are you the subject of the state the way someone living in medieval times might be a subject of their king?  Are you the possession of the government?  Is the state responsible for you, or are you responsible for yourself?<BR>
<BR>
Those who believe in individual rights and individual responsibility rarely have a problem with individuals having the power to defend their freedom.  This is what a gun is.  George Washington described the second amendment as "The people's liberty's teeth."  He understood that the ability of people to defend themselves from tyrrany was the best defense against tyrrany.  Our system of government was designed to prevent tyrrany, but I think we all know that it hasn't always worked.  Guns are what keep this country safe from so many would-be eroders of our natural rights.  Now some might argue that the way to defend our rights is at a ballot box.  In a perfect world where everyone was honest that would be true, unfortunately things just aren't like that.  Josef Stalin once said that those who cast the votes have no power compared to those who count them.  The last presidential election should prove that to anyone, regardless of your partisanship.  Lets not forget also that Adolf Hitler was democratically elected.  Tyrrany can just as easily come in through the front door as it can sneak in through the back window.  <BR>
<BR>
The reason I'm a member of the NRA is the same reason I'm a member of the ACLU, both organizations work tirelessly to protect our rights.  Charleton Heston is a member of the ACLU also.  <BR>
<BR>
Blaming guns for social problems such as school shootings, makes about as much sense as blaming movies or video games for school killings.  There are approximately 90 million firearms in private possession in this country.  If they were such a problem then the streets would be red with blood by now.  Guns are not a problem, making them illegal cannot solve a problem that does not exist.  I don't know about you, but I don't think I'd feel better about people being stabbed to death in school, or beaten to death with baseball bats.  For guns to be of special concern in this issue they would have to have some kind of mystical power to make people want to kill, which they don't.  Lets not forget all the bombs that those guys planted in Columbine.  The bombs didn't go off, thank God, but just how would making guns illegal prevent those bombs from being made?  <BR>
<BR>
I really do think sometimes that the gun elimination crazies are made up of people who are unfortunate enough to be blessed with a good heart, but cursed with a profound lack of common sense.  I also think that many of them are quite simply running a left wing program hatched as far back as the 1930's or before.  Gun control and political correctness are only separate issues above the water line.  Below the surface they are both part of a larger agenda.<BR>
<BR>
It is quite true that the only way you'll take my gun away is to pry it from my cold dead fingers.  It is also true that anyone who comes to try and take my gun will be shot.  You may kill me in the end, but I'll take five or six of your cohorts with me.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

By the way, I don't recall ever seeing an incident on the news involving seventeen children beaten to death with a baseball bat or stabbed to death with a pocketknife.  It is a trivial manner to run away from some crazy kid brandishing a baseball bat.  It is <i>not at all</i> trivial for moral, well-adjusted children to defend themselves from a badly-parented child with a gun.  The very nature of guns dictates that they deliver lethal force in a way that the intended target is completely unable to defend itself.

Huh?  Now what in the good God damn is <i>this</i>?  We're talking about school shootings here.  Are you seriously suggesting that slow children should be able to arm themselves before they go to school?  You're even crazier than the guy below who says that the <i>teachers</i> should be armed.  I could be mistaken, but I always thought that the "guns for self-defense" crowd was talking about adults, and never took the position that all <i>schoolchildren</i> should be armed.  Maybe I was wrong?  Given some of the replies to this article I guess it wouldn't surprise me.<BR><BR>

This aside, I ask again: If we lived in a moral country where children had <i>no</i> access to guns, do you <i>really</i> think we'd see headlines about <i>seventeen</i> children killed in a "mass batting" by a couple of loners?  Nobody is suggesting that bats or hammers or knives can't be used to inflict harm.  But to try to equate the <i>level</i> of harm from a gun with the level of harm from a bat is classic example of Gun Thinking 101.<BR><BR>

<i>BTW, I've never seen a anti-gun nut answer that question. If I'm attacked by someone bigger and faster than me, do I let them pound me into mush all to protect their precious morals because they wouldn't let me use a gun?</i><BR><BR>

Somebody who would attack a smaller and weaker person <i>has</i> no "precious morals" to speak of.  I would say this: if the gun enthusiasts were to spend all of the time they spend at NRA conventions and gun shows and the practice ranges at a gym or a public health club instead, they wouldn't have to worry about being smaller and weaker.  But as it stands, I have little sympathy for people with no self-control who let their mouths get themselves into situations that their bodies find it hard to get out of.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I answered this very clearly and succinctly.  We all have the ability to better ourselves physically.  There is no excuse for a moral, law-abiding citizen to be physically inferior to <i>anybody</i> that he or she considers to be an adversary.  In simpler terms: if you're going to pick fights, pick them wisely.  Otherwise, I believe that my exact words were "I have no sympathy" .. meaning yes, if you're outmatched, then the result will be as it may be.<BR><BR>

At any rate, I reiterate my claim that the vast amount of time that gun owners spend in dark closets polishing their AR-15 and dipping their bullets in poison would be <i>far better</i> spent lifting weights or running or getting some sort of physical exercise so that if the day ever comes that they have to defend themselves like a <i>real</i> man, they'll be able to.  I'm almost ashamed to be an American when I look at the state of our population; we are turning into a herd of fat, slobbering, violent cretins.  The world is laughing at us, and we have the unmitigated gall to think it's because they're "jealous."<BR><BR>

To conclude, I have to say that your call to arm America's schoolchildren is among the most odious things I have ever read here.  There are laws against children bringing guns to school.  I know that the NRA and its members consider these laws hateful and want to see them overturned, but for your sake and the sake of your children (if you have any) I sincerely hope that you don't get your wish.  Guns are dangerous enough when they are left laying around the house.  By issuing them to every child and turning playgrounds across America into war zones, we'll have succeeded in killing off our most precious natural resource.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Trouble is never caused over "nothing."  There is always <i>some</i> cause that problematic situations can be attributed to.  The vast majority of hypothetical "muggings" that gun nuts claim to be frightened of could be avoided by staying in the right neighborhoods and avoiding seedy areas after dark.  This is the sort of common sense that they used to teach children in grammar school.  Perhaps gun owners have gotten it thrown out of the curriculum along with evolution?  After all, common sense does not lend itself very well to many gun-defending arguments; it only makes sense that they would want to teach as little of it as possible.<BR><BR>

<i>Oh, and if you hate this place so much, you could always leave. Probably raise the property values on your street.</i><BR><BR>

Yep, see, there you go again.  Why is it that gun nuts spend half of their time ordering moral people to leave this country and the other half threatening to murder them (as you did to me in your top-level post?)  Well, I'm not leaving.  As the saying goes, evil is allowed to flourish when good men stand back and do nothing.  I have nothing to fear from cowards who are unable to defend themselves and instead must hide behind the barrel of a gun.  I do appreciate the insult about the property values, though I must tell that where I live, the presence of a normal family is vastly preferred to a household where assault rifles litter the living room and half a dozen broken-down cars are up on blocks in the yard.  But that is as it may be.  I have refrained from being insulting thus far, and I had hoped that you would extend the same courtesy.<BR><BR>

<i>Please point us to a page stating the NRA wants these laws overturned.</i><BR><BR>

The NRA wants all gun laws overturned.  You know it, and I know it.  They have a public face that they put on, but at the end of the day, their true agenda is the unlimited proliferation of as many guns as possible to as many people as possible.  Heck, they even almost got a law passed in Vermont that would require people who did <i>not</i> own a gun to pay a yearly fine.  You have yet to defend your position that all schoolchildren should be armed.  I claim that this will precipitate a new era of violence in our schools and is in violation of the law.  What part of this do you find objectionable?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Owning a gun does not lead to militia-membership.

<BR><BR><i>The National Rifle Association (NRA) is the flagship organization of the gun crazies.</i>

<BR><BR>This may be true.  I am not a member of the NRA, and do not plan to ever be.  I do not feel that the NRA represents the average gun owner, and most gun owners are not members of the NRA.

<BR><BR>How long did it take for you to figure that one out?  I do not own a gun to hunt, I have not hunted since I was 10.  If I want meat, I go to the supermarket, not the woods.  I own a gun primarily for self-defense.  Assault rifles are short-range rapid-fire weapons which are ideal for use with multiple assailants.  They do not posess the accuracy for hunting, because they were not designed for that purpose.

So many of the stories depicted as "sad story of another life taken by a gun" are stories of uneducated children over at a friend's house.<BR>
<BR>
There is no way that we will ever get to a state where there are no guns anywhere.  Even if the freedoms guaranteed by our forefathers are revoked there will always be someone authorized.  A police officer or military man.  And there will always be crimininals with illegal weapons. <BR>
<BR>
Your children need to know what to do when they encounter a gun.  If they're on the wrong side of it should they kick it out of the criminal's hand?  If they're holding it should they point it at their friend's head and say the latest line from their favorite movie?<BR>
<BR>
You point to Columbine as if it is the only way that children die from gun violence and gloss over these other preventable "accidents" that could have been prevented with a little education.<BR>
<BR>
To suggest that children do not need to know how to behave safely around firearms is to put the children's lives in danger.<BR>
<BR>
While we're discussing things that make no sense, you characterize the average gun owner as a "slobbering fundamentalist alcoholic" and site a study showing higher alcohol use among collegiate gun owners.  In case you haven't, the college years a known as a time of higher alcohol use across the board.  To point to a collegiate study as proof that all gun owners imbibe more alcohol is an irresponsible stretching of the truth shown in the study.<BR>
<BR>
Also, most fundamentalists believe they will go to hell if they break the commandment "thou shalt not kill".  And claiming that fundamentalists Christians are in favor of murdering young children is ludicrous and an obvious attempt to exploit the emotions of the reader without respect to the facts.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion, whether you believe guns are the ultimate evil or a tool to keep society balanced  so that we do not become easily controlled sheep, you have a responsibility to your children to see that they are properly prepared for a possible gun encounter. <BR>

It had no intention of offering individuals protection against other individuals (although they likely would have assumed as much), so much as offering entire communities the means to resist if the force of law alone did not protect them.

<BR><BR>If someone really wants to kill you, they likely can choose a time and place where you cannot do anything about it - armed or not.  How they try to kill you is irrelevant.

<BR><BR>However, governments can cause much more death and suffering than individuals can, and in this century they have.  One of the reasons that the German and Soviet holocausts against their own citizens worked out so completely in the favor of the government is that the Jews and Russian rural peasantry had neither access nor right to guns, even a limited one.  I don't know how many were killed by guns in crimes over the last five years, but I feel certain it will not equal six million Jews gassed during World War II, nor an estimated twenty million killed by Stalin to force collectivization on his farmers.

<BR><BR>I will concede that a problem of law might exist - the right ones not being on the books, or not being enforced if they are.  I am not in favor of giving up the Second Amendment, because of media-generated hysteria.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I don't think I completely agree with this interpretation.  While I believe it has a fair amount of validity to it, it misses an important detail.  The United States Constitution was written after a particularly nasty little revolutionary war in which a group of colonists felt they were being treated unfairly with no representation within their parent government.  They also felt that this was further aggravated by the fact that government troops were being housed in private homes at the citizens' expense, and the fact that they were largely prohibited from keeping guns that might be used to defend themselves.

<BR><BR>Put all that together, and when writing the law of the land, you include a small detail about preserving the right of citizens to own and maintain their own weapons so they can never be treated that way again.  Yes, that's right:  the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States was written to ensure that no government could ever impose tyrannical rule over its citizens with impunity.  Also consider that at the time, the practice of dueling was legal and socially acceptable; restricting the right to carry weapons for self-defense was unthinkable for the Framers.

<BR><BR>Beyond that I have no complaints with your statements.  But I don't think you quite grasped the full impact of the Second Amendment.<BR><BR><BR>A troll's <a href="./2002.1.5.184242.7637.html#31">true colors</a>.<BR></FONT></td></tr>

And either try to make him stand back or put a hole in his head. I want you to answer this. And you DO realize that terrorists wear Kevlar too right? So why aren't they just called armor piercing on TV? BEcause jackasses like you want to promote a bad image of gun owners. So remember fellow gun owners....keep and protect your right to keep and bear arms...if so even with the firearm that law is supposed to be protected<BR>
