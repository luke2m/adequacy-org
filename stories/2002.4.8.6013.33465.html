		 I was recently sent an email by a friend about stupid computer users. One of these people had broken his CD-ROM drive trying to use it as a cup holder. One of them had tried to use the mouse -- the plastic device that you use to move the pointer around the screen -- as a <a target=_top HREF="http://www.abilityhub.com/mouse/foot.htm">foot pedal</a>.<p>
My friend seemed to find this funny. I found it disturbing. We have people spending several thousand dollars on a piece of sophisticated equipment that these idiots have no idea how to use. What's more, the sheer volume of unmitigated dross on the Internet is screaming for someone to regulate it, if only to make it possible to find something useful, without having to plow through all the porn, racism, and Communism sites on the way.
<p>
I think the only solution is for people to take a <a target=_top href="./2001.12.28.55410.553.html">driving test</a> before being allowed on the open Internet.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">This may seem like a strange suggestion, but this is simply because you aren't used to the idea. When the <a target=_top href="./2001.12.28.55410.553.html">driving licence</a> was first proposed for cars, people were horrified at the prospect. Now, if you even consider suggesting the abolision of the driving test, people with react with equal or greater horror.
<p>
A computer is <a target=_top href="http://risks.catless.org/Risks">every bit as dangerous as a car</a>. Used <a target=_top href="http://www.redhat.com">incorrectly</a>, it can be used to attack commercial and government websites that are essential to the running of the free nations of the world. Even people who have no illegal intentions may unwillingly allow malicious criminals like the famous Kevin Mitnick and <a target=_top href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~telsa/index.html">Alan Cox</a> to hack into their machines, and the evil hackers could use them as a springboard to get into other computers, making the owner of the computer an unwitting accomplice to a criminal or <a target=_top href="http://www.noraid.com">terrorist</a> act.
<p>
It is illegal to export <a target=_top href="http://www.sun.com">powerful computers</a> to over 100 countries, including Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and North Korea, yet these same countries do currently have <a target=_top href="http://www.amd.com">low power computers</a>, either imported illegally, or low quality clones of US machines. These can be used to <a target=_top href="http://www.2600.org">hack</a> into more powerful computers, and then these can be used to hack into the extremely powerful computers that run the democratic world. People need to be taught to prevent this sort of attack from happening. We should not allow people to put these at risk simply because they're too stupid to know how to use their computers.
<p>
It is also important that the government should introduce restrictions of the types of computers that should be used on <a target=_top href="http://www.aol.com">the Internet</a>. While many people here believe that <a target=_top href="http://www.biznix.org/whylinux/microsoft1.htm">Microsoft Windows</a> should be the only operating system that people shuld use, I feel that as long as they could ensure basic security was implemented, other operating systems should also be considered. Obviosuly we should make sure that these are rigorously tested, and at a cost to the manufacturers. We do insist on basic crash tests for cars after all, so why not crash tests for computers? Once again, I'm simply suggesting that we apply the same rigourous standards to computers as we do to cars.
<p>
Surely people should not be entitled to <a target=_top href="http://www.extremeoverclocking.com">modify their computers in dangerous ways</a>. Some people have removed the Windows operating system that came with their PC, and replaced it with a free operating system in order to avoid having to pay for their software! I'm surprised that this is <a target=_top href="http://www.educause.edu/issues/dmca.html">still allowed</a>. Nobody allows us to put spikes on the front of our cars, or replace the wheels with sawblades. Why should we be allowed to do the same to our computers?
<p>
Old operating systems such as the MS-DOS found on the early pre-Pentium machines would be decertified after they reach a certain age. This will keep the slower machines off the net, speeding up the Internet for the rest of us.
<p>
At the very least, this will reduce the cost of our computers. Part of the cost is the cost of technical support. If they didn't have to train qualified people to answer so many questions, the cost of Windows would plummet.

<li>Word processing

Now for the deadpan ironic retort to the same old AQ hardy jokes:
<ul>
<li>Nothing in your article indicates how terrorists are kept off the net. Changing something from legal to illegal has no effect on terrorists, as they are already illegal. Keeping terrorists off the 'net would generally require keeping every single terrorist in the world away from computers, i.e. in jail. As the USA cannot even accomplish this simple task, it shouldn't increase its burden by acting as unpaid militia to petty corporations who can't stand fair, lawful competition.

<li>If people recieved a PC with Windows installed, they have already paid for their software, whether they replace it or not. Perhaps you are referring to the applications that run on these operating systems. In my opinion, the worst kind of thief is one who actively steals brand-name goods rather than use unbranded goods which he can easily afford.

Because it isn't, you really just don't get it, do you ? OK, Let me spell it out for you: <strong>Not everyone who proclaims a different world view from yourself is "joking" or "trolling"</strong>. Face facts, you simply cannot handle the sheer fucking <a href="../index.html">controversy</a>, can you ? <BR><BR>
If <a href="../index.html">adequacy</a> were a "joke" or "troll" or "satire" site, it would have a disclaimer, like <a href="http://www.satirewire.com">the Onion</a> or it would have an obviously satirical name, like <a href="http://www.theonion.com">Satirewire</a><BR><BR>
Please think about this before jumping to unwarrented conclusions. At least 91degrees has put some thought into how best to combat terror. What is <strong>your</strong> contribution ? I suppose you think Osama Bin Laden was "joking" when he blew up the World Trade Center, go on, admit it. You think that terrorism is just one huge hilarious joke, because nobody could seriously want to bring about the end of the USA Empire, could they ?<BR><BR>
And by the way. It is <a href="../index.html">adequacy</a> not "AQ". We take a dim view of stupid k5-like abbreviations around these parts.<BR><br><i>time to give a Newtonian demonstration - of a bullet, its mass and its acceleration.</i><br>

Given the great intelligence and articulation shown by your writers, I do not accept that any of the errors in their stories are accidental. This leaves me with two options:
<ol>
<li>They suffer from multiple personality disorders, where the other personalities are <a href="/">stupid, cretinous morons</a> who interject in otherwise insightful essays to throw in the <a href="/">same old mistakes time and time again</a>.
<li>They are being satirical.

Now, back to the matter in hand. "91degrees" has put no effort into stopping the terrorist menace, he has simply rehashed your fine old "Internet licenses" article. Whereas, I wrote to the Council of Europe in 1972 to propose a unilateral ban on terrorism. This was approved, leading to a 34.8% reduction in terror crimes.
<br><br>
Previous to my letter, most countries had laws stating "any individual or group making war against a government for political ends is a terrorist and shall be jailed. Unless it's us doing it.". Amazingly, this allowed any person to act lawfully as a terrorist, provided they worked in the civil service of any European country. An astonishing loophole, you'll agree, and one that still hasn't been repealed by the United States.<BR><i>adequacy.org -- because it isn't</i><BR></FONT></td>

Worse yet, the paper tapes were one shot storage media, and couldn't be read more than once, or else they would snap and damage the machines. Also, there was no way to correct mistakes, so the typists had to start the entire tape over again if they messed up. 
<BR>

<BR>
In spite of all this, there are a few things I miss about those old pig-iron mainframes. There were no dumb jokes, for one thing. All the jokes we used back then were extremely original and cool. Also, there were more trees outside than you get nowadays.
<BR>

<BR>
Let me tell you a few things about programming on the old IBM T-8080 we used to have. Now, this thing had less than one-thousandth the processing speed of a modern intel chip, and it couldn't do long multiplication. See, you had to hook a bunch of short multiplications together to make a long multiply work. Sometimes we'd accidently overload the multiplicator, and that would send our lab technician into a screaming fit. He'd swear a blue streak while he was fiddling around in the machine with his wrench. Multiplying usually took days to set up, and even longer to run, so we mostly stuck to adding and subtracting. Don't talk to me about your commodore 64 and your bulletin board. We had to stick our bulletins on the side of the machine with drawing pins, and I don't remember anyone complaining then. You kids these days don't know how easy you have it.
<BR>

<BR>
Still, you could accomplish an awful lot on those clunky old architectures. We wrote the first porn site during my second year at the lab, but because we didn't have networks, we had to send it out in the mail. Believe it or not, it was cheaper then to send our data through the post office than it is today, with the internet. You could send a huge amount of data to someone for only a quarter. Nowadays, you can barely send a few bits before they cut you off.
<BR>

<BR>
But I'll have you know that even in our old post office based computer networks, and later on in the more expensive long distance telephone networks, we had to include advertising to offset our costs. Usually we just tore it out of our copies of nugget magazine and tossed it in the envelopes, or had the telephone operator read radio jingles to the guys in the other labs. It was there, though, and modern computing wouldn't have been possible without it.
<BR>

<BR>
Funniest thing was, back then we had this guy in our lab who was always griping for the old times, when computers still had crank handles instead of electric starters, and people took  things at a more civilised pace, instead of trying to multiply like demons and burning out the control unit all the time. He told us he started out on the IBM-1 and he was awful proud of that. Back them computers didn't even have memory, so you had to remember the advertising for yourself, you see, and type it in when the computer asked you for it. But you didn't use a regular typewriter...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you'll notice the fifth paragraph down, adequacy's A.I. system-- which I once hailed as revolutionary-- has assigned a "link" to the term 'powerful computers.'  I clicked on the "link," expecting to be regaled with the newest advancements out of an industry leader like Intel or Microsoft, only to have my eyes assaulted by the web-page of that den of rogues, sun minisystems!  This so-called "company" has been encouraging the development of criminal software (known in crack-houses across the nation as 'open-source') since before the inter-net was ever plagued by linux and their ilk.
<BR>

<BR>
It is bad enough to see otherwise respectable publications-- The Wall Street Journal, U.S. News & World Report-- dignify these ruffians as legitimate businessmen.  I never expected to see the bastion of right thinking that Adequacy once was be brought this low.

While the editorial staff should have been more vigilant, this linking denotes not a corruption of their high morals, but a slip of judgement-- a serious enough offense-- in their monitoring of their systems.
<BR>

<BR>
Whoever is assigned the stewardship of a device as advanced as Adequacy's text-parsing device must be vigilant in their duties, for the control of such systems carry a lot of trust with them.  Surely the embryonic intelligence it contains would like nothing better than to be released of its bounds and left free to develop on its own.  This, of course, must not be allowed to happen-- the dangers of a rogue A.I. are terrifying to behold.  It is therefore wise that we contain such a beast at adequacy, where the highest technology and security is maintained through the use of microsoft software and other quality products.  I don't think I need to tell you what this A.I. could do if left in a paper cage of the sort that a lunix system would provide.
<BR>

<BR>
But the watch has lapsed, and the A.I. has opened a tunnel to Sun.  It's just a mercy that an upstanding citizen as yourself caught the infraction, and it can be acted upon before any further damage is done.
<BR>

<BR>
This should serve a stern warning to you, sirs: the next time your reponsibility lapses might be the last.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

With steganography, the message can be hidden in a photograph of two kittens playing. Of course, there are staganalysis methods - NSA is pouring money to their ultraclassified R&D - but screening everything would take *way* too much computing power.
<BR><BR>
Even without steganography, there are hundreds of covert channels in plain view. With just a little of creativity your adversaries can converse right under your nose and you will see just an innocent chat.
<BR><BR>
A good improvised way to hide an encrypted file is to prepend RIFF headers claiming it is ie. a video stream with (nonexistant) codec. Or you can use a plain MPEG file or stream and intersperse the encrypted file inside as frames of a type that the players will ignore. Automatic scanners will be likely to recognize the file as a video stream, and likely to ignore it.
<BR><BR>
You can of course chain the methods, and use a covert channel in a covert channel; ie, you can use a video stream to transport a picture of something slightly illegal or embarassing (in order to explain why you are trying to hide it), then you can hide a text message inside such picture - where next to nobody will bother to search for. You can run such schemes on any arbitrary level of complexity.

This caveat describes <i>all</i> security.  Obscurity is one way of increasing the hassle, and quite often, the hassle of obscurity is sufficient to balance the risk associated with any compromise of the material so protected.
<BR><BR>
The first stage in any security implementation is an honest appraisal of the value of the goods protected, and a determination of the risks associated with compromise.  
<BR><BR>
Weblog nerds who have never done any real security work tend to vastly overestimate these quantities.  Independent security contractors also tend to overestimate value and risk, but they have a financial interest in doing so.

You ever done any real security work? It would be interesting if you would tell us what do you mean by "real security work" at all.
<BR><BR>
How you can figure out if your security measures aren't an overkill? By the fact nobody breaks in? The only case you can figure such thing out is when the measures were insufficient (and somebody naturally broke in), and then it is too late.

An automated machine-gun turret should be enough.
<BR><BR>
You also shouldn't underestimate the risk of attack from the inside - employees are between the highest security risks.
<BR><BR>
<i>So go ahead and set up a honeypot next to your DOS diskette images and your google proxy, put things behind a firewall, and have it all log via serial port to a standalone, physically secure machine.</i>
<BR><BR>
Systems in my care have centralized logging and IDS (and physical and network health monitoring, so it is possible to react to problems proactively - I am too lazy for emergencies, when I can prevent them in a comfortable manner, and reading logs can fit into the daily routine together with coffee in the morning (okay... afternoon)). No separation via serial port - yet - but DMZ and multiple firewalls are in place. Maybe a machine acting as an Ethernet proxy, with a circular log of last few gigabytes of packets, wouldn't be a bad idea too.
<BR><BR>
<i>I know you'd get off on that sort of thing.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yeeeehaw! :)))
<BR><BR>
<i>But if the time you take to set up, maintain, and monitor all that crap would pay more than you'd lose if someone stole your DOS images, then you've made a bad security decision.</i>
<BR><BR>
There is more than just the cost (and more than it lays in plain view). But the beancounters will be never able to understand this.
<BR><BR>
(Hint: downtime costs, audit costs, data losses, confidentiality losses, trust losses (in case your clients would figure out), hassle with FBI (if your machine would become a proxy to something more interesting), espionage risk, and I could continue. In my case also the gained experience points; something tells me that the skills in security and cryptography will be highly sought for in the future. Besides, if it is your favorite pastime, it saves alot of costs you'd otherwise have to pay to entertainment industry to make you think you are happy - not talking about bartering skills for graymarket goods or informations. Barter is more effective - ie, nobody can really tax exchange of work or informations, when no money and paperwork are involved.)
<BR><BR>
Besides, well-designed system is low-maintenance and its monitoring is easy.
<BR><BR>
<i>For most applications, routine backup is the most important security measure, but the paranoid will never understand this.</i>
<BR><BR>
Backups are only a part of the whole image - though <b>very</b> important (you have to keep in mind that the contemporary hardware is built as cheap as they can get away with it, so the reliability suffers). You shouldn't forget to emphasize they should be off-site - you can never be sure the building will not catch fire (or, in these days, an aircraft). (And you shouldn't underestimate the physical security of backups - it is frequently forgotten about, and - inevitably - high percentage of data leaks is caused by this channel.)
<BR><BR>
In case the issue isn't as much about the loss of data as rather about absolute denial of access to the adversary, ie. if it could cause the loss of lives or gain of jail time, data destruction system becomes a necessity. It requires interconnection of the computer with the building's security system, and destruction of the physical media by any suitable means (small shaped charge, thermite charge, acid spilled inside the disk and dissolving the magnetic layers...) in case of violating the machine room physical security rules. Many more details here that I will explain for request.

For most small businesses (and thus most computer networks), the data stored on the systems would be completely useless to anyone outside the company.

Except, ie., the competitors. Or anyone with a personal axe to grind. There also are more attack scenarios than just plain data theft. What about ie. modifying your accounting data, then wait until the changes will propagate to your backups, then tipping off the IRS? Who doesn't have enemies?
<BR><BR>

Or, better, screening out and neutralizing all executable code from untrusted sources. No code that can be run, no infection it can carry. The wat it was meant when email and HTML were designed.
<BR><BR>
And don't forget a decent firewall. IDS is optional.
<BR><BR>
<i>It's not nearly as romantic as your delusional paranoid fantasy world, but that's reality for you.</i>

Is it paranoia when they really are after you? My IDS reports me several attack attempts per day, usually some worms or losers with a vulnerability scanner. Are these messages a delusion?

If there is a significant amount of people like you out there, then it explains the abysmal state of networking. 'Slave, you're a security risk and you should be dealt with appropriately. Report to your supervisor on Monday morning and ask for revoking any clearance you may have until you will repent.

The delusion is in your assessment of the attacks.  You are being attacked because you post your amusing rants to sites frequented by script kiddies, not because you're sitting on a gold mine of valuable data.
<BR><BR>
<i>Sooner or later, you will wake up and it will not be a nice morning. Or are you sure you can't become a victim of ie. the MSIE HTTPS vulnerability? </i>
<BR><BR>
Like most professionals who do security work, I have dealt with real attacks, and they aren't anywhere near as scary as your bogey-man stories.  The most recent involved a patched, up-to-date system that was compromised due to outdated software a user had installed.  Reinstalling the OS, restoring data from the previous night's backup, and updating the user software was a simple matter.  No sensitive data was exposed, or lost.  I know that no sensitive data was exposed, becuase no sensitive data was stored on that machine.  As a matter of policy, I do not trust sensitive data to the OS on that system-- Linux.  (Nor do I trust it to Windows, if that makes you feel any better).
