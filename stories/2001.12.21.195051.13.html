The whole first paragraph of the comment you were responding to is a sarcastic reponse to the claim that Linux is illegal.  He was not seriously claiming that the US is an Orwellian state.  One would think that regulars to adequacy.org would be familiar with the concept of irony.<br>
<br>
Linux is not illegal.  If one wants to try and claim it is, it would be nice to at least <i>try</i> to back up the claim with evidence.<br>
<br>
Regardless, the point of the post was that mislabeling things, whether it be the US or Linux, detracts from fruitful discussion.  It's a shame that the editorial quality of the technical articles is so poor (just refer to the hundreds of posts pointing out factual errors, while ignoring the ignorant flaming that's usually included). It's sometimes not apparent whether the intent here is fruitful discussion or mindless "hacker" bashing (which is no better than any of the mindless bashing most here seemed to have run into at slashdot and kuro5hin).<br>

Note the lack of a <a href="www.blanketlady.com/">blanket</a>, suggesting that Linux Zealot spends so much time with Linux that he rarely sleeps. The bed appears to be similar to that found in <a href="http://www.lvarea.com/mavica/usprison.jpg&lt;/A">state prisons</a>, suggesting that his <a href="./2001.12.16.145311.35.html">run in with the law</a> from last episode has indeed landed him in prison.
<br>
<br>

Indeed, the burglar (who may be FBI Guy in disguise from last episode) bears a <a href="http://www.flameresistantclothing.com/products/t15.htm">striped uniform</a> similar to those found in federal prisons. Why the burglar is holding a <a href="http://www.accuracyinternational.com">gun</a> is unexplained, but one may assume that Linux Zealot has been assigned to a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/prison/docs.html">minimum-security prison</a> due to the <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">lax computer prosecution laws</a> in the United States.
<br>
<br>
This comic is a perfect example of the poor security mindset that is typical of Linux Zealots, because they assume that Linux is <a href="http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2001/09/18/insecurities.html">immune to viruses</a>. Contrast this to the superiority of other operating systems such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">Windows XP</a> which has had only one security hole reported so far.
<br>
<br>
Sir, I must praise you for your work on exposing the typical mindset of a Linux Zealot. I look forward to future installations of the guy who just LOVES <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Open-Source</a> software.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This is evident from the facts that the bird has two ears (owls are the only birds to have ears) and that it is night time, as can be seen from the presence of the moon (owls are the only nocturnal birds). If you knew anything about the animal kingdom you would also be aware that the owl is famed for its wisdom, and the towering presence of the noble and wise old owl in the first two frames contrasts delightfully with the youthful foolishness of Linux Zealot.<BR><BR>
To answer your other question, the owl is perched upon a tree. It is unlikely that an electricity company would have gained planning permission to site a pylon so close to a house (unless Linux Zealot illegally built a house next to a pylon without purchasing the land or obtaining planning permission, which wouldn't surprise me considering the Linux community's lack of respect for the law. However, if Linux Zealot were to build his own house by his misguided do-it-yourself open source ethic, it is likely that his house would be unfinished, unstable and prone to falling over, none of which are apparent in this cartoon), so the only other possibility is that the owl is in a tree.

It is ridiculous to speculate that the bird is a penguin, since <a href="http://users.capu.net/~kwelch/pp/">penguins</a> don't have ears. And, as any child in kindergarten will tell you, penguins are flightless, so how would the Penguin reach the branch of a tree? It is possible that Linux Zealot named the penguin "Tux" and nailed it into the tree as some sort of mascot (adding animal cruelty to his already long list of crimes), but it is far more likely that the bird is an owl.<BR><BR>
On a related note, I tried to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=penguin">search for information on Penguins on Google</a> and Google's #1 link is to <a href="http://www.linux.org">Lunix.org</a>. As you can imagine, I was horrified to discover this. The Lunix community has subverted Google, so that innocent children may be drawn into the evil world of Lunix when researching the animal kingdom (presumably in kindergarten, when they learn that penguins are flightless), thus ensuring a new generation of Linux Zealots. This evil must be stopped!<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

Sure I do, but what I don't have is the ability to feed my kids, because you ripped off my code instead of <strong>paying for it</strong> as the law of the land DEMANDS. It is CLEARLY theft, and you can call yourself a cracker, or a hacker it really is all the same to me.

I cannot explain it to you much more clearly than that, except but to ask you, who will develop software when you and your warez-d00d buddies have bankrupted every software company in the world with your sleazy criminal acts ?<BR><BR>
Also, in English it is common practice to capitalise the word 'I' when referring to oneself. But then as a self described ignorant software-stealing hacker I expect even this simple rule is beyond you. Or perhaps this is another of societies rules that you are too '1337 to obey.<BR><BR>

The problem is that we're not talking about anything physical. Just 1's and 0's. All I do is copy them. 
<BR>
I purchased my hard drive and therefore I own all the 1's and 0's on it. I can change them to whatever I want. Yes, even to mimic someone elses program. Once their program is copied on it, I can change its 1's and 0's how I want. Noone else owns this harddrive but me so why should they tell me what I can and cant do with it?
<BR>
If I change the 1's and 0's to turn off a 30 day trial period on some software so what? They are my 1's and 0's and whatever they make up is also now mine. 
<BR>
Thats the theoretical arguement.
<BR>

<BR>
My main one is: Im not paying because its SO simple to crack stuff that it just seems like wasted money. Come on, if you found a really simple way to use pay phones without paying would you really continue to put coins in everytime?
<BR>
I usually pay for software that I appreciate. I pay for windows and big software. But if someone has a copy of something I want then its so much easier to copy it there and then rather than go out again and buy another copy. The arguement that software companies will go out of business because of this is rubbish. Businesses ALL pay full licenses for software as they get seriously fined if anything is pirated on their computers (even without their knowledge). Quite a lot of software is overpriced anyway.

<BR><BR>Ever hear of counterfeiting? That's a parallel with copying software. Counterfeiters take nothing away from real cash, just like pirated software takes nothing away from the real software. Therefore, I am positive that you also completely condone counterfeiting, even if, like pirating software, it leads to a fucked up economy.

There is only a finite ammount in the world. Its also a strange resource which only holds as much value as society believes it does.

The paper form - cash - has as much real value as a piece of paper. But its the believed value that makes a 5 cent piece of paper worth $10.
<BR>
But copying $10 notes, increases the ammount them in the population and the more of something there is, the more worthless it becomes (unlike data). So copying a physically worthless note does actually lower the believed worth of that note and the believed worth of the original note. So it isnt plain copying but a form of division where the more you copy, the less worth all the notes have. Thats why its illegal.

Copying 1's and 0's has no effect on the original copy's value or the copy's value and is completely different from counterfeiting. So like I said - there is no parallel to software copying.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The value of money isnt intangible at all. Anyone knows that the whole idea of currency is based on the faith of the people.
<BR>
People used to trade by barter - exchanging goods with material value for other goods with material value.
<BR>
 
<BR>
Common currency was introduced because bartering sucks. Some king sets the standard by saying 'Each of these copper coins shall now be worth a sheep' and it goes from there. Then people used these copper coins, with no material value, to purchase goods which did have material value. The system only stays working as long as the seller of the goods believes that they can also buy goods themselves using the copper coins.
<BR>
If people didnt have faith in the symbolism value of the coins then they would refuse to accept them and the whole system would collapse.
<BR>
The same is still true nowadays with cash, cheques and numbers on computers representing your bank balance. None of them have any material value - only a symbolic value. If people started believing that $10 notes were worthless then their worth would suddenly go from symbolic to material which would make them the same value as a piece of paper. 
<BR>

<BR>
"By freely giving something away, money and software lose value." 
<BR>
Thats just stupid. So if 10,000 people made copies of a piece of software, then you expect its shop prices to go down?
<BR>
Better stop microsoft to stop selling windows or they'll just end up making it worthless.
<BR>

<BR>
Software has no material value. Whether I copy a string of binary once or 1000 times it does nothing for the value of it - unlike if I had done it with cash..or raping which you seem worryingly fond of.
<BR>

<BR>
The author is only going to recieve about 40% of the shop floor price anyway. I dont want to pay for boxes and shops and their staff - I only want the software.
<BR>
Would you accept its ok in this case, if I sent 40% of the retail price to the author and then copied the software?
<BR>

<BR>
"Why do you think companies that are based upon open source always end up bankrupt?" 
<BR>
Name a case.
<BR>
To be open source software it isnt allowed to be sold and therefore its stupid to ever dream of basing a company on this idea. The vast majority of open source software is written for nothing (and yes all their children starve of course).
<BR>

<BR>
If people like me are only after something for nothing then why did I pay for my copy of Linux rather than download it legally for free?

Like Linux profits. Fortunately, there is an alternative based on an author's continued expectation that society will continue to honor the mechanism of copyright, just as it honors a multitude of similiar expectations that makes other commerce possible. This is why the author creates. This is also why the author is paid, can buy food, clothing and shelter. But apparently you are a society of one; and one who wishes to impose his incoherent vision on everyone's reluctant head under the delusion that it makes some kind of absolute, formidably correct good sense.

Im not paying $40 for a piece of software - I want to use it first to see its any good. And screw all those demos and crap that dont allow you to test most parts of the program. If I think its worthy of $40 and the authors have done good work I will then buy it. But if I decide they havent then I simply wont use that software again obviously. THis happens with so many games I copy. Most look good at first but turn up to be poor, unfinished works. I dont want to pay for these but if I cant copy to see new software I cant find the good stuff from the masses of crap out there.
<BR>
You seem to have been brainwashed by the "its stealing no matter what the reason is" mob. All the money poured into the properganda against 'piracy'. God, even the word to describe it is anti. Although to be honest pirating just makes me think on ships on the sea with men with beards and hooks going ARHH!
<BR>
Everyone I know who is into computing, pirates software but not in an exploitive way. An exploitive way would be to sell copies or edit and sell them. 
<BR>
I mean many of these are the people who will be trying to sell it one day so im sure they will understand when people copy their own software in the future. Noone cares anyway - programmers themselves are usually paid on contract - they dont care if a few people copy it. Its the big corperations and finance people belonging to companies who are like "we must start a propaganda campain against copying to force everyone to buy our software to get more money" and every normal person is like "who cares?". Then you have companies using pirating as an excuse to put their software prices up. 
<BR>
They dont realise that these 'pirates' havent actually stolen money from them. If pirating didnt exist - which is what they say they want, then they wouldnt get a penny more than they do now because the pirates simply wouldnt bother buying the software. 
<BR>
At the end of the day I expect many people have pirated much of the software I have bought. Its all supported in the end not like your nightmare senario where everyone copies it and companies shut down.

Without piracy, Commodore would never have shipped as many systems as they did. If you go back and read LSD's "Grapevine" now, they had a LOT of articles on piracy with all the claims of doom and gloom. Idiot companies saying "In 5 years there won't be a software industry if piracy continues." What a crock of shit. Electronic Arts, arguably one of the most proflic software houses on Earth, made BILLIONS last year. Piracy is harming the industry? Quit smoking crack.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;P&gt;The truth is, casual piracy harms nobody. All the idiots on here comparing it to rape (make that comparison in front of a woman who has been raped and see what their reaction is. You DESERVE to have your fucking head kicked in for remarks like that) and car theft, they are bogus analogies. You pricks seem incapable of distinguishing the severity.
<BR>

Say person X downloads a warezd version of "Ninja Slash Part 712". Person X plays this game and does one of two things. It either sucks, and they dump it, having not wasted their money and paid for shit. Or they like it. Sure, they may not buy the original of this, but the inevitable sequel they probably will. I know a lot of software pirates. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WITH A COMPUTER THAT I KNOW pirates software. These range from teenagers right the way through to pensioners. The fact is software is too expensive, and the majority of it is total shit, and as the software companies seem to only be interested in money, rather than quality product, why the fuck should we pay them our hard earned money to be fleeced. 
<BR>

<BR>
Comparing piracy to stealing a car is stupid. As has been pointed out many times, but, for some reason, hasn't sunk into your thick little heads, someone steals my car (PLEASE!) I no longer have a car. They now do. Property has been removed from my person and is now in someone elses posession. If I "steal" software, that means lifting it from the store and taking it home. THAT is stealing. I have deprived the store of a boxed version of the game, and prevented them from a cash transaction for said game. If I COPY the game, said store still has the boxed version to sell. No theft has occured. If I photocopy an advert from a magazine, by all your stupid definitions, that would be piracy. I've made a copy. "But it's still theft". 
<BR>

<BR>
The piracy that DOES cause problems is the mass pirating operations. THOSE damage the industry, the casual user at home who downloads a warezed version of Quake 3 is doing as much damage as someone trying to bring down a 747 by throwing feathers at it.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't pirate, well, I'm happy for you, and quite honestly believe you're full of shit. If you claim to have never pirated ANYTHING, then you're a fucking liar. If you've so much as recorded 1 second off the radio, by your definition, you are stealing and are a pirate. If you've ever photocopied ANYTHING that you didn't have explicit permission to photocopy, you are stealing and are a pirate. If you have ever taped anything off of television, you are stealing and are a pirate.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">oh come on! mental torture? If someone seriously suffers mental torture because someone pirated their software then they suffer a serious disorder.
<BR>

<BR>
Sure, a rapist doesnt take anything from thier victim but they inflict mental suffering. Piracy doesnt do that no matter what you say. You really think people need councilling after someone copies their software?
<BR>

<BR>
"If you weren't intending to pay for the software, then you weren't intending on using it, but you changed your mind and are using it, so you should pay for it."
<BR>
Or you could see it as:
<BR>

<BR>
I want to use the software. But it costs more than its worth to me. So now I dont want to buy the software. Therefore the author gets nothing.
<BR>
Now logically, the situation is the same as if I had copied the software. Except that in the current case I dont have the software but in the copying case I would have it. 
<BR>
Logically again, the authors situation is the same whether I choose to copy it or not. So the common sense thing is to copy it.
<BR>
If you argue that I should now pay for it then I would start again at: ...But it costs more than its worth to me. So now I dont want to buy the software....etc.
<BR>
A never ending paradox which can only be resolve by me copying the software.
<BR>
You will probably think this is an excuse - as you said "Why do hackers believe that's justification for piracy?". Because it is. I buy software when I think is good value or the right price. Most games I have are bought and the vast majority of software I have is bought. Only the occasional piece which I wouldnt have bought anyway have I ever copied. And I usually only copy them to try them out as a sort of 'demo'. Usually I only use them a couple of times and then never again. Of course the same is not true for copied music and copied movies but still, I wouldnt have bothered buying them anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
Note: hackers and software copiers arent the same thing. There are hackers who dont 'pirate' anything just as there are vast numbers of non-hackers who do pirate.
<BR>

<BR>
"Are you saying you do not profit off pirated software? I guess shoplifters don't profit off stealing, since they aren't stealing money, and your thickhead seems to believe that cash is the only way to profit."
<BR>

<BR>
shoplifting and copying are completely different.
<BR>
Shoplifting is wrong because it is removing something which has value.
<BR>
Copying is, as it says, making a new copy of an existing copy. 
<BR>
Look if a shop has 1000 statues and prices them at $50 each then they have a net value of $50,000. If a shoplifter steals one then they have taken $50 from the shopowner - which is wrong.
<BR>
But if a piece of software is $50 then if the author copied it 1000 times would they have $50,000? no because data copies are worthless. Therefore I can copy the software as much as I want and im not 'taking' any money. 
<BR>
Thats why I can say I can copy if I wasnt intending to buy it anyway. Because the author loses nothing.
<BR>

<BR>
hmm yes, copyright for intellectual property. So do you feel that its justified to patent the human genome? Or copyright a certain string of genes? What if I copyrighted 
<BR>

<BR>
What if I took 100 bytes in a certain order and decided to copyright them? What if I did it to 10 bytes?
<BR>
Then I could spend my life looking through other peoples programs and if I found 10 bytes in that order I could sue them. Yes? 
<BR>
On the same note, if I copied someones program except for the last 10 bytes then is that infringing copyright? If I copied someones program but inverted all the 1's to 0's and vice versa then have I infringed copyright? Where is the line between a copy and a similar piece of 1's and 0's? Thats why copyrighting any building blocks - whether they are genes or bytes is impractical before we get down to any type of morality.
<BR>
"the government believes that people should be able to have rights over what they create."
<BR>
Yea but the government knows shit about computers so how can they make a good judgement? Their current thinking is that laws of possession can simply be applied to computer data which just shows their ignorance.
<BR>

<BR>
"If we did things your way, everything would be released to the publics including diaries and other personal works"
<BR>
When did I ever say that? I didnt. Im not advocating the public release of all data at all.
<BR>

<BR>
Get this: If I copy software and then encrypt it on my computer then noone would ever be able to prove whether it was encrypted software or just a load of random 1's and 0's. Reinforcement of software copyright is impossible.

The "entity filled with the top computer engineers" you speak of will consist of a large number of hackers although probably not malicious ones. You only have to look at some of the computer laws they have introduced to see that

the government doesnt listen to their advice when it comes to law issues.

(So now she wont get any)

<BR>

<BR>
If you've accepted that I havent taken money from the author (which you clearly have done above). Then where did the time and honor come from? If I dont want to buy the software then im not giving appreciation of time and honor to the author anyway. So if I then copy it, theres no difference. Its the same argument as the money.
<BR>
Unless you are saying that everyone is taking time and honor from the author unless they purchase the software.
<BR>

<BR>
"Where do you draw the line? How do you differentiate from private data that you will force to be public and private data that you will allow to remain private? You have constantly refused to specify"
<BR>

<BR>
If its private then encrypt it so that it cant be made public by anyone but you or a selected group of people that you choose. But if you release data unencrypted then you are stating that its public data and must accept that anyone can get hold of it.
<BR>
For example if I sent my credit card details over the internet I would encrypt them. If software companies dont want people to copy their software they should encrypt it (unfortunately this means noone can use it but thats my point).

What about something else, there must be something that you would not give up or agree with even if the law said so.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway just about everyone pirates software, I havent met one person who doesnt have the odd pirated copy of something or other (although we all have bought the majority of our software).
<BR>
So doesnt this mean that democratically people reject this law in part?

<br><br>
Also, this Intellectual Slavery thing you are talking about seems to support Scientologists. Why do you support Scientologists?
<br><br>
Scientology is a religion in which only certain members at advanced stages of enlightenment have access to special information, which is secret to others. Scientology has long been controversial, with critics maintaining that it exploits members. Some critics, including former Scientologists, have put secret documents from advanced stages on the Internet. In response, church officials invoked copyright. Police have raided homes of critics, seizing computers, disks and other equipment. This is all rather curious, since the stated purpose of copyright is not to hide information but rather to stimulate production of new ideas.<BR><br><br>

On a side note, check google.com and ask for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&q=scientology+critics">scientilogy critics</a>", then do the same test for only "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&q=scientology">scientology</a>". It is interesting how in the second case you have hard luck to find any critical voices in the first 12 matches (people rarely check more than first page of search results). Google, though, publishes a link to opposing views to its directory cathegories on top of the search results. However, there is still the potential of hijacking the search engine results by indirect tactics, increasingly common in the world of propaganda.

<BR>
The difference is huge.
<BR>

<BR>
If I walk into a shop and steal an item, I have taken away some physical possesion of that person. They have less than they did have and quite rightfully I can be prosecuted for it.
<BR>

<BR>
If I copy a program I have taken nothing away from the author, they have exactly what they had in the first place. So what have I done against them? Nothing.
<BR>

<BR>
Sure, the author doesnt get any money from me copying it but this ISNT the same as stealing.
<BR>
Stealing it would be where I am directly taking money from the author.
<BR>

<BR>
Now people think of this situation like they do with an item in a shop and shoplifting. But read the above three paragraphs again and you will understand it has no parallel to it.
<BR>
I have taken no possesion away from the author so how can they charge me for it?
<BR>
Well what about time? Well I could sit on the edge of a street playing my guitar. Would everyone be obliged to pay me because they hear my music? A good argument against me is that I dont have to pay if I dont use the software. However if I do use it then I should pay. Fair enough.
<BR>
But often if I have to pay for it to use it then I wont buy it. 
<BR>
I only pay for the things I really like or need. 
<BR>
In a shop I might see some software for $30 but I dont really need it and im only curious enough to use it for about one day only. Then no, I wouldnt bother buying it. But say I get home and I find out that one of my mates has that software then seeing as the author wouldnt get any money anyway (because I would never buy it) why cant I copy it and use it for free?
<BR>
I agree that people who never pay anything towards software they appreciate arent really aiding its future development.

This is the real core of the hacker "ethic". Hackers don't believe that people's privacy should be respected. They have no respect for property, and yes, they do steal. Theft of services, theft of credit card numbers, theft of copyrighted information.
