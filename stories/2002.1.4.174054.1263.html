		Like most <a href="../../special/who.html">right thinking individuals</a>, I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005N7YZ/adequacy-20">tradition</a>. Unfortunately, as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">software professional</a>, tradition requires me to spend New Years Eve <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/09/10/angry_dwarf/">drinking alone</a>, playing <a href="http://nethack.org">video games</a> and <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/take-my-job-please.html">sobbing uncontrollably</a>. While I'm as <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/michael_haggerty/expose3.htm">conservative</a> as <a href="http://www.lehi.com/vin1.html">the church is true</a>, this past New Years I decided to do something a <a href="http://home.clara.net/mycetes/babbage/">little different</a>: I went to <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/main_f.html">Canada</a>.

<p>With the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6304071787/adequacy-20">fair chloedancer</a> by my side, I traveled to <a href="http://www.city.victoria.bc.ca/common/mayor_msg.shtml">Victoria, British Columbia</a> in search of a <a href="http://www.smokedot.org/">good time</a>. I didn't find it (except when alone with the <a href="../users/510/index.html">lovely chloedancer</a>), but I hope that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192822756/adequacy-20">my story</a> can serve to warn others about the dangers of <a href="http://www.advancenet.net/~k_a/uzbekistan/travel.htm">third world vacations</a>.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>Geographically, <a href="http://www.communist-party.ca/">The People's Republic of Canada</a> is the <a href="http://www.canadasucks.com/">second largest nation on earth</a>, but its <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086373">population</a> is a scant 35 million.

Decent health care is only available to the <a href="../../special/who.html">very rich</a> and even they must cross the border into USia to obtain it as what <a href="http://www.ccnm.edu/">little heath care infrastructure</a> the country possessed has been destroyed by an <a href="http://www.wcotc.com/health/hoax.html">ineffective and costly system</a> of socialized medicine.

<p>Of course, <a href="http://clinton.senate.gov/issues_health.html">ill advised nationalization</a> schemes are hardly <a href="http://hamilton.701.com/sites/701/HTML/greaterhamilton/261557.html">unique to Canada</a>.  The plague of <a href="http://www.democrats.org/index.html">communist ideals</a> infests most third world nations and is the chief obstacle preventing them from enjoying the standards of prosperity, literacy and health most USians take for granted.  Canada, however is worse than most.  

<p>Like many an intrepid adventurer before me, I always pack my Discover Card when exploring new territory.  Not only does it "pay to Discover," but the card is accepted wherever you see the Novus Network sign.  Also, my Discover Card safer than carrying cash in the crime ridden ghettos of the frozen North, and it bears original artwork by the only surviving member of the Beatles, Ringo Starr.  Truly, my Discover Card is the perfect form of currency.

<p>At least it would be the perfect form of currency if the backwards and technologically deprived merchants of Canada could be persuaded to accept the blasted thing.  They can't.  Apparently processing my Discover Card is beyond the capabilities of their primitive electronic banking system.

<p>So there I was in Canada, a nation that likes to think of itself as the 51st state without any form of electric currency.  No problem thought I, I've got $200 USD and the delightful and intoxicating Chloedancer by my side; I'll be fine.  Unfortunately, the process of turning the delightful and intoxicating Chloedancer into the delightfully intoxicated Chloedancer took half that sum and a new pair of shoes accounted for the remainder.  (The third world is a great place to buy shoes as the vast quantities of cheap, illiterate and unskilled workers attract shoe manufacturers.)

<p>I ran out of money on day 3 of my 5 day stay on scenic Vancouver Island, which had its good and bad points.  The worst thing was that I had to ask the luscious Chloedancer to pick up the check for the remainder of the trip.  In her wisdom, she was better prepared for the primitive environment that is Canada than I and she graciously agreed to pay for the remainder of our stay.  On the plus side, I got to see Canada from the perspective of the average Canadian (solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short) rather than as a wealthy USian tourist.

<p>To the casual observer, Victoria could pass for a USian city.  The streets are wide and packed with traffic, the citizens are dressed in typical USian middle class garb and there is even a McDonald's.  On closer examination however it begins to resemble a nightmare vision of USia, one that could only appeal to the white supremacists of Northern Idaho.  The only black man I saw in Victoria worked in a restaurant and the Chicano community was completely non-existent.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not accusing our neighbors to the North of out and out racism (although that is a very plausible explanation).  I'm just observing that whatever means the Canadian government uses to promote ethnic diversity are clearly not adequate.

<p>Fortunately, I'm descended from hearty bands of Danes, Swedes and Norwegians who crossed the Atlantic to join Brigham Young in the promised land, so I could blend in perfectly with the aryans that surrounded me.  I simply took to mispronouncing the letter "O" and saying "eh" a lot and they accepted me as one of their own.

<p>Posing as a vacationing lumberjack from the icy Yukon, I learned the truth about this seemingly USian city.  Victoria is naught but a facade designed to project a positive image of Canada to visiting USians.  A great deal of effort has gone into this charade, but, as always, the devil is in the details.

<p>My dearest love, Chloedancer, had mentioned the strange fact that there is a computer store on nearly every street corner.  This struck her as being a bit unusual on a small, sparsely populated island.  It was even more unusual considering that computers are a tool of the literate and Victoria is strangely lacking in bookstores.  Closer examination revealed that most of these shops were dedicated to the Apple Macintosh.

<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with the history of computing, the Apple Macintosh is a type of computer that was quite popular in the late 80's and early 90's.  Eventually it was rendered obsolete by the release of Microsoft's astonishingly popular Windows95 operating system which did everything the Macintosh did but ran on much less expensive and faster hardware.  While the Macintosh still hangs on in the graphic design market and is aggressively marketed by Apple, the idea that a town the size of  Victoria could support 2 Macintosh retailers, still less the dozens we counted is preposterous.

<p>Now I know that the handful of Macintosh advocates out there will be up in arms about these statements, but it's the simple truth.  Over 90% of personal computers run some version of Microsoft Windows.  While I'll not dispute that the Macintosh may be the finest system nobody uses, I must also point out that the Amiga, Lunix and BeOS communities make the same claim and you can't all be right.

<p>When you consider that Apple pays good money for the placement of Macintoshes in movies like "Independence Day" and "The Net," the explanation for the shops of Victoria becomes clear.  Obviously this is the result of a joint marketing campaign by Apple and the Canadians to make Canada seem technologically advanced and the Macintosh seem like a viable computing platform.  Both assertions are demonstrably false.

<p>Additionally, the lovely Chloedancer and I counted 5 adult boutiques.  While there's nothing wrong with the use and enjoyment of marital aids, 5 shops in a city that cannot house more than 90,000 inhabitants seems a bit odd.  It's worth noting that the greater Salt Lake City metropolitan area, with 10 times the population can only support 2 adult boutiques.  Once again I smelled a marketing ploy and my subtle interrogations of the locals proved my hunch.

<p>If you're going to run a country with a degree of ethnic diversity that the Third Reich would have envied, you must be very careful to avoid charges of fascism.  What better way to demonstrate a fun loving and tolerant environment than wall to wall clitoral and anal stimulators?  Canada is saying "look at all these butt-plugs, surely we're not about to round up homosexuals and send them to extermination camps."  Once again I'd like to note that I'm not accusing Canadians of out and out racism or homophobia, but if they had nothing to hide would they be working so hard on their image?  I think not. 

<p>I'm not the only one who noticed something false and repellent about Victoria.  While visiting the Crystal Gardens, a pigmy marmoset managed to tunnel out of its cage.  This smallest member of the primate family immediately spotted chloedancer and me and headed toward us.  I will never forget the look on its little marmoset face as it seemed to plead with us to help it escape this frozen, socialist wasteland.  How it knew we were USians is a mystery to me, but I am certain that it did.

<p>Perhaps the saddest example of the deceit and false advertising that permeates Victoria relates to the female breast.  It's a matter of record that unsound and inflationary monetary policies have made the Canadian dollar worth about 70% of its USian counterpart, but I had no idea that the same was true of their women.  Here in the states, the most common bra size is a 36 C, just as it is in Canada.  Unfortunately, when my beloved chloedancer attempted take advantage of the exchange rates to purchase a pair, she found they just didn't fit.

<p>It seems that a USian 36 C is actually larger than a Canadian 36 D.  Are our neighbors to the North so insecure about their flat chested women that they must incorrectly identify cup sizes?  It seeems incredible, but no other explanation fits the facts.  I suspect that not only are USian breasts larger, but they are also firmer and more full than their Canadian counterparts.  I was going to test this theory, but chloedancer objected to my feeling up the women of Canada.  I protested that it was all in the name of science, but to no avail.  Some women just don't appreciate the sacrifices that science demands.

<p>Finally, something must be said about Victoria's fetish for all things British.  Their list of top tourist activities is as follows:
<ol><li>High tea at the Empress.</li>
<li>Tours via "Tally Ho" carriages.</li>
<li>Tours via "English style" double-decker busses.</li>
<li>Visits to the "Royal Wax Museum."</li></ol>
<p>Is Canada so devoid of character that it must import it from the British Isles?  I don't see Detroit advertising itself as "Ye Olde Motore Citie."  Of course this isn't just Victoria, all Canada is divided into Canadians who like to pretend they're French and Canadians who want to pretend they're British.  Those who don't fit into either category define themselves as "sort of like Americans, but not really."  The second largest nation on earth has nothing that even remotely resembles a national soul.  The Canadians may pretend to be British (or French) all they like, but behind that is a gnawing lack of identity and behind that lies the endless expanse of the tundra. 

<p>In the final analysis, Victoria BC is a pitiful exhibition.  It's a painful attempt at overcompensation by a nation that is (rightfully) ashamed of itself.  Much like picked on adolescents who turn to Ayn Rand and her imago of pitiless strength to hide their own helplessness, nobody is fooled and what pity we are inclined to feel is overwhelmed by disgust.  Would I recommend visiting Victoria, BC?  If you can make the trip in the company of a woman as amazing as Chloedancer, absolutely.  Otherwise, I'm afraid that Victoria has little to recommend itself.      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oh, come now.  With regard to dealing with a woman of substance, that mode of response is pitifully outdated and you know better, really.  Just in case you need a reminder, here's the deal:<BR><BR>
If you were spineless, I'd never enjoy your company as much as I do.  Instead, I prefer the model whereby I state my terms and you're free to choose your actions in response (and the reverse is also true).  It's a no-nonsense and more respectful approach, yes?  As a right-thinking male, I think that you actually appreciate having a woman who is direct and uncomplicated with no hidden agendas or game-playing strategies; there's no denying that <i>you know you'll always get a straight answer</i> whenever you need to know what I think, right?<BR><BR>
While we may not always see eye-to-eye, that just means that there's room for negotiation and compromise.  Consider this:  if you'd instead proposed with equal enthusiasm that <i>I also would be welcomed to participate in the scientific inquiry you desired to pursue,</i> that might have changed my opinion, ma cher.  You know that, too, but just aren't ready to go there yet and I respect that.<BR><BR>
Your masculine self-identity is strong enough take me at face value and I appreciate it -- it means that I don't have to placate your ego, pretend, mince or simper, either.  I think it's refreshing and that it fosters a win-win outcome, don't you?<BR><BR>
As to the "kept man" part, please remember that there are <a href="./2001.10.15.22333.197.html">some</a> who would, in fact, envy your status in that capacity, even if it was only a temporary condition.  Variety is the spice of life, after all, and you well know that I'm quite capable of running circles around you when it comes to basic life skills if for no other reason that I've simply had more practice.  And you certainly didn't mind it at the time if my memory serves, so don't pretend otherwise, all right?<BR><BR>
Be proud to be a man with a woman who can take care of herself, stand her ground and, while being very independent by nature, has chosen your company above all others and absolutely adores you.  Hell, all things considered, it would not be inappropriate for you to be downright smug about it; if so, you'd have my blessings 'cause you've certainly earned 'em.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

YES! Thank you! Someone with a little sense! It's like I said in my own comment, America hasn't always been - the nation we all know as America was started by a group of British settlers who happened across a chunk of rock across the Atlantic, decided that the natives living there were savages and proceeded to kick the living sh*t out of them for no reason whatsoever and believed they had the right to do so.
<BR>

<BR>
Before anyone starts shouting at me for having an restricted and inaccurate view of the British, then please note that I myself am British, so I am perfectly well qualified to make these statements.
<BR>

<BR>
I'd just like people to recognise that NO country is perfect (the UK and America included), and that you can't judge one country against another - it just doesn't work like that.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>So many errors, so little time.
<BR><BR>First off, America is the name of a pair of continents, not a country.  While it's a popular mistake to refer to the United States as "America," it's still a mistake.  Mexicans, Brazillians and even Canadians have just as much of a right to call themselves "Americans" as Usians do.
<BR><BR>Secondly, the United States of America was founded when the inhabitants of 13 British colonies rebelled.  While British subjects, these colonists included large nubmers or Irishmen, Africans, Dutchmen, Germans and Spaniards as well as an British majority.  In fact, the first "American" killed as part of the USian independence movement was an African-USian by the name of Crispus Attucks.
<BR><BR>Third, while the treatment of Native Americans by European colonists was usually apalling, some colonial leaders in what was to become USia (William Penn springs to mind) were quite ethical in there treatment of the original inhabitants of the land.  Unfortunately these precedents were not followed in later USian history.
<BR><BR>Fourth, the pilgrims who arrived on the Mayflower arrived by way of Holland, where they had been living for several years.
<BR><BR>Finally, being British does not excuse ignorance.  You might as well claim, like ESR does, that you're qualified to speak authoritatively on the subject of anthropology because you wrote part of nethack.
<BR><BR>To sum up: you are in error, you have criticized <a href="../../special/who.html">your betters</a> and you need to apologize.

Even now, Americans are dying alone in Afghanistan to keep you safe from international terrorists. It sickens me, the thanks we get.

We die to defend you. We manufacture the modern goods that you take for granted. We provide all your entertainment. The least we ask is a little gratitude. For all intents and purposes, America IS the center of YOUR universe. Accept it. Get over it. If you want to be a part of it, all you have to do is move here.

I'd ask you not to forget that the America you know today was started by British settlers.
<BR>

<BR>
Just bear little thoughts like that in mind before you start criticising other countries and making remarks about Canada being "too British". 
<BR>

<BR>
The whole Discover card thing, too....just because two countries are geographically adjacent to each other doesn't mean they absolutely MUST be exactly alike. I'd have thought a better course of action would be to get a more GLOBALLY generic credit card, such as Mastercard or Visa. Discover is much much more US-centric as far as I can tell...we certainly don't have it here in England.
<BR>

<BR>
Your ideas about computer technology seem rather confused too. Apple computers are far from obsolete - in fact, no computer is TRULY obsolete. NASA used extremely old computers to control shuttle launches and moon landings when computers far more powerful were available, and why? Because they suited the application and were tried-and-tested - they weren't likely to fall over at the critical moment (unlike Windows machines - and I have experience). It's also silly to call x86-based hardware "faster" than the Motorola processors used in Apple machines - it's true that x86-based machines often have CPUs with higher clock rates but the designs and instruction sets are totally different, so one may be more efficient than the other - remember, clock rate isn't everything. As I was saying about computers having different applications, x86-based home computers are usually used for office work or games, while Apple computers tend to excel in graphics work. But the two are completely interchangeable. Personally I use x86 computers, running either Windows or a Unix variant, but that's just because I'm used to those.
<BR>

<BR>
This post shows that people just need to be a little more broad-minded and GET THEIR FACTS STRAIGHT! I've read exactly ZERO articles on adequacy.org that have been completely factually correct.

<BR><BR>Like most of the arrogant-yet-ignorant rabble from HardOCP and other sites, you seem to believe that Performance = IPC * Clock rate.  This is false.
<BR><BR>IPC * Clock rate gives you something called the average execution rate -- this is not the total performance of the system.  For total performance you also need to take into account the number of instructions required to perform a given task.  The difference between RISC and CISC is the difference between "reduced" and "complex."  The RISC philosophy is to have a small number of very fast machine instructions.  The CISC philosophy is to have machine instructions that, while not particularly fast, do the work of several other instructions.  What this means is that if you have a CISC machine that averages 1 instruction per clock and a RISC machine that averages 1.3 IPC and both machines are operating at the same clock rate, you have 2 machines with the same average performance.
<BR><BR>But wait, it gets worse.  Not only does a RISC cpu have to execute more instructions to perform the same task, but it also has to store all those instructions in the cache to prevent the processor from stalling.  On big, industrial strength, more-cache-than-god RISC processors like the Alpha, PA-RISC or IBM's server grade implementations of the PowerPC core, this isn't a problem.   But on processors with a small, 256K L2 cache, like the one's we find in Wintel and Macintosh PCs, the extra ammount of cache required by a RISC architecture has a measurable performance penalty.
<BR><BR>But that's ok, isn't it?  All that really matters is the colorful plastic case, right?<BR>--Peter<br>Are you adequate?<BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
My point was that certain architectures lend themselves well to certain applications. Whether a RISC processor has to execute more instructions to perform a task than a CISC processor is irrelevant - because of the differences in physical design it may or may not execute single instructions much faster.
<BR>

<BR>
Please note, by the way, that I am not referring to any specific architectures (PowerPC and ia32), I am trying to make the point about all current and conceivable designs.

Yes, and they have developed their own culture. I fail to see how it's relavent to compare Canada, which is still part of the Commonwealth and tries to act "British", and America, which had a war of independance and has developed its own culture and way of life.
<blockquote>we certainly don't have [Discovery Cards] here in England. </blockquote>
You think that just because we dont have it here means that it must just be a US phenominon? Maybe the author has travelled to other countries where his Discovery card was quite readily accepted and so Canada and the UK are the odd ones out in this regard?
<blockquote>NASA used extremely old computers to control shuttle launches and moon landings when computers far more powerful were available</blockquote>
I'd like you to prove that assertion. I find it far more likely that the computers NASA used to coordinate the moon landings were top of the line in the 1960's, a time when nearly all computers were mainframes, minicomputers were only just beggining to appear and the desktop PC was barely a pipe dream.
<blockquote>unlike Windows machines - and I have experience</blockquote>
If you hadnt said it I would never have guessed. Comparing NASA's custom setup to standard Unix/Windows machines is an awful attempt at a strawman. Windows, and most Unicies for that matter, are not designed to be used in real time or failsafe environments, they are designed to be reliable general purpose operating systems. Considering the wide range of environments both get deployed in, I think they are both doing quite well.
<blockquote>As I was saying about computers having different applications, x86-based home computers are usually used for office work or games, while Apple computers tend to excel in graphics work. But the two are completely interchangeable.</blockquote>
The auther of the article actually said that. Compare:
<blockquote>Eventually [the Mac] was rendered obsolete by the release of Microsoft's astonishingly popular Windows95 operating system which did everything the Macintosh did but ran on much less expensive and faster hardware. While the Macintosh still hangs on in the graphic design market</blockquote>
There the author says pretty much the same thing you did. The Mac can do everything Wintel can do, but Wintel can do it cheaper. If given the choice between two functionally identical systems, one costing half the price of the other, which would you choose? Its only in areas of graphical design where the Mac has any significant advantage, hence its dominance in that area.
<BR><BR>I'd like to reccomend that in future you actually bother to comprehend articles before you reply to them. This means reading them twice or possibly even three times, not just skimming through and then hitting "Post a Comment". I realise your probably in a hurry trying to beat to that climax when you fineally hit "post", but I most certainly did not enjoy reading this premature jism of yours and I should imagine most other readers here found it equally distasteful.

<BR>

<BR>
Most of the people who live here work in the government, tourism or services industry. Therefore, we have lots of tourist-y things to do (Old England happens to be a recurrent theme due to the history of the city), and lots and lots of restaurants. 
<BR>

<BR>
About 300,000 people live within a 25 minute drive from downtown. We do have more computer stores than we can reasonably support, but only a couple of them are dedicated to Apple. Most are x86 only, and some have some iMacs on display, but to say that we have "dozens" of specialty Apple stores is just not true. 
<BR>

<BR>
Most stores take Visa and MasterCard, a few take American Express, and i've never heard of a Discover card. Almost all stores in the downtown area accept US cash. 
<BR>

<BR>
We have about a dozen McDonalds, probably twice that number of Subways, lots of Starbucks, a Burger King, a Wendys, and a few A&W's. No Arbys, Jack in the Box, or Black Angus however. 
<BR>

<BR>
It is true not many black people live here. There is, however, a large asian population. If you take the ferry over to Vancouver, it's even larger over there. Large enough that many public schools are not in session on asian stat holidays (such as Chinese New Year). So if you want to see ethnically diverse, try Vancouver instead. 
<BR>

<BR>
All that us residents of Victoria want from our tourist friends in the south is for you to come visit, do the tourist-y things we've promoted, and spend money in our restaurants and bars. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm glad the author enjoyed his stay.

And for all your guns you still weren't able to stop what is viewed by many in the US and outside the US as a coup de tat when your president was assassinated(Kennedy).
<BR>
If you saw it happen on the news in Ecuador you would have seen it for what it was but because it happened in the good ol' US of A then mercy No! I mean  why would anyone in the most powerful nation in the world want to usurp control. US citizens are politically apathetic but some of ya'll think you can make up for it and regain some controll over your lives if you arm yourselves. It's idiotic and not exactly what the enlightened founding fathers of your nation had in mind. I doubt if Benjamin Franklin if he were alive today would be packin' a glock 9mm semi-auto with chrome finish.
<BR>

<BR>
You think you're the most powerful nation on earth but that's not really true. If the Japanese sold off all of it's US bond holdings right now your market would be devastated and would most likely precipitate a national depression. The Europeans have harmonized their currency and they're talking about doing the same to their military. The US unfortunately because of ignorance is going to wake up one day soon and find that it's not the largest military and economic power in the world. You are going to be competing with a unified Europe on one side and an Asian economic alliance on the other.

<BR>
That's not even a real argument. You are making an unrelated 'either or' assertion. 
<BR>
Is American foreign policy moral rather than geopolitical? No, of course not because foreign policies are geopolitics. It's a weird thing to say.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyways...
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
How do you reach the ridiculous conclusion in what I said that the arms
<BR>
trade will DOOM America. (Your country is not America by the way it is the United States of America which makes up less than 1/3 of North America).  My argument was about US foreign policy and domestic practices and not about 'America' sellin' guns ta' warlords. And I didn't argue that 'American hegemony was a bad thing'. What I said was the US is in a delicate position because of foreign holdings in the US bond markets and that Europe is shaping up to be larger global super power in which the US has little stake. I did not say this will doom ehm...'America' but it certainly will alter it's hegemony on the global scene. The US has had a tendency to bully the third world where the Europeans have tended to treat them more equitably. Who do you think these developing nations are going to want to deal with? And it's not a simple matter of...
<BR>

<BR>
'residents of nations with warlords foolish enough to import massive quantities of uncontrolled guns.'
<BR>

<BR>
It's a childish oversimplification. We're talking about legitimate governments being overthrown by the help of the US. It's tantamount to Germany selling leopard tanks to the KKK to overthrow the government in your country. The average US citizen probably wouldn't appreciate Germany's involvement. Just as many pro-western Iranians weren't happy when their pro-western government was overthrown by the Ayatola with the help of the US, ooops! And Why did the US invade Panama...because Noriaga was a criminal? If he was such a crimanal why was he on the CIA payroll. Why did the US involve itself in the 1960's giving millions to oppose Salvador Allende after his election which resulted in the succession of General Augusto Pinochet. A man accused of mass murder. The CIA is  credited with masterminding and financing a coup in Guatamala which stopped 10 years of progressive governments, governments that were working for labor unions, and land reform (most of that land was owned by the United Fruit Company. A US company.) The list goes on Peru, The Congo, Iran, Iraq, Bolivia, Paragua...
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not just making this shit up. Here is a quote from a house debate back in 1990. 
<BR>

<BR>
DEBATE ON BOXER AMENDMENT - TRANSCRIPT OF HOUSE DEBATE ON COVERT OPERATIONS [EXCERPTS] Christic Institute, Wednesday, October 22, 1990 
<BR>

<BR>
"During my service on the House Select Committee on Intelligence ... that investigated intelligence abuses 15 years ago, I received chilling documentation on the dangers and disastrous effects of American covert activities. 
<BR>

<BR>
I oppose the destabilization of foreign governments through the actions of covert operatives.... I oppose so-called guerrilla movements operating under the rubric of "freedom fighters," whose aim is to overthrow foreign nations on behalf of the American people, using American tax dollars, without the knowledge of the American people."
<BR>
-Ronald V. Dellums
<BR>
Representative of California 1971-1998
<BR>

<BR>
And why would I feel pathetic.  My country has the highest standard of living in the world. Nobody tries to kill me when I go abroad. I don't have to worry about getting sick and dying because I can't pay my medical bills. We're rich in natural resources of which you're almost depleted, fresh water, timber and oil.
<BR>
We've paid for our freedom in blood too entering both world wars before the US not because we were attacked but because it was the right thing to do. And you guys imprison more of your own citizens than any other nation on earth including China which has 5 times your population. Think about that. And that of those people in prison over 50% of them are black but black people only make up about 12% of your population. Yeah, I'm feelin' real pathetic about my country.
<BR>

<BR>
You say something critical about the US and you guys assume we're either jelous or we hate you. I like the States a lot, I've spent half my life there. I like the people particularly but your politics leaves a lot to be answered for. And it's not just how it affects the world but your own people. Hundreds of thousands of your young men died in south east asia in war like a football game was sponsored by US corporations and made some people very rich. People who invested in Bell helicopters as an example.
<BR>

<BR>
But hey maybe this is just me being pathetic.

How the hell do the Romans fit into this. You just seem to come up with stuff out of nowhere. And who was talking about the USSR? I never included them in my argument.
<BR>
And do you honestly believe that just because Isreal and the Czech Republic sell weapons it justifies the US selling weapons and providing financial aid to overthrow governments. What game are you talking about? People are being murdered by their own governments, it's not a game.

Why do you insist on calling governments  and organizations that buy weapons 'Warlords'. Is that the new word for the millenium. I remember when it was 'freedom fighter', how things change. A little less CNN for you, maybe.

The National Guard is no more a militia than a quilting club is. Not that it matters, because the Second Amendment recognizes a right 'of the people', not 'of the collective', although some courts have seen fit to subvert that.<BR><BR>
As for the Kennedy assassination, it illustrates the very reason WHY common citizens should have guns. Even with all of the security and such a single Marine with a rifle was able to change the face of a nation, despite the fact that the anti-gun folks would like you to believe that the  government is so overwhelmingly powerful that a common arm has no use against it. Many before and since have made similar contributions, Timothy McVeigh and my friend Eric Rudolph are two contemporary examples, although they used bombs, the central idea is still the same.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Look - most people in Canada use debit and credit cards all the time and most retailors are wired for it. We were using them long before they were widely used in the States because unlike the US - where it's a sin against God for anyone to actually cooperate with anyone else, we established a national ATM network in which all banks participate.
<BR>

<BR>
So unlike having to worry about which bank I use and whether or not that ATM or store will support it, I just go anywhere and use my card.
<BR>

<BR>
Apparently, somehow, you managed to waltz in with an impossibly unusable set of cards and then assumed everyone else is to blame.
<BR>

<BR>
How typically American.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, you want to talk useless - try buying something on the Web from Canada. If they actually sell and ship outside Fortress USA (and remember that NAFTA thing - wow, has that helped), then the odds are that your Visa or Mastercard won't work because the American credit card system is a quiltwork of little credit zones which can't handle cards from outside their zone.
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry, this article is a classic 'Ugly American' prose - a wonderful example of  exactly why American's aren't highly appreciated unless they're buying friendships. 
<BR>

<BR>
My advice - stay at home and enjoy your... well culture, if that's what you call it.

CANADA HAS THE HIGHEST LITERACY RATE ON EATH. At least we aren't a country of fat, inbred, rednecks who are so fucking dumb that you have to resort to causeing the "Brain Drain" which has plauged canadas intelectual population (which is most of us). Could it be that you need to have such big bras is because your women are fat asses? I think so. I don't pretend to be french, or british. by going to vancouver you have not seen canada AT ALL. Could it be that the reason that such a vast area of our country is forested is because we don't agree with destroying every natural resource for progress. Canada has a fine econamy. An what the hell is this about the frozen ghettos of the north? You obviously havn't compared them to your gehttos. The reason that you didn't see many negro people in canada is because canada never went to africa and forced them against thier will into boats and into slavary. If a negro person cam to canada it was because of thier own free will. And what the hell is this about the 51st state? Why would we want to be part of the USA? Why would we want to be dragged down to your sick level? Canada is not a communist country. We are free, we do not opress certain racial groups (more recently muslims) as you do. We pronounce words as the british do. That is not because we are british wannabees it is because it is right. WHO DO YOU THINK INVENTED THE FUKCING LANGUAGE!!!!!!!!!!!! It is colour NOT colour. Zed Not Zeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Your stupid queers why don't you just shut the fuck up and leave us alone. I do not envy you

I clicked on a few of the gratuitous links near the top of the article; either the links didn't work or they were boring.  I notice that the author didn't bother to put any links after the first few paragraphs -- as though expecting the reader would stop reading there.

I am amused by the lengths some 'USians' will go to just to prove how much better they are than other people.  If you are feeling that insecure you might want to click on one of those ubiquitous 'enlarge your penis' ads.

The most surprising thing though, was the fact that a 'USian' was even aware that there are other contries on Earth.  And all this time I was under the impression that you weren't that well educated.

We aren't well educated. Any of us. We all sit around, fat and dumb, in our trailer homes and watch Jerry Springer all day.

You insult every other nation on the face of this planet and promote yourself while at the same time hiding your many many many flaws. I admit that there is no nation on earth which doesn't have its flaws but i can also admit that the US if more flawed than the average country. So far you have picked pretty big losers for your presidents (Bush is a figurehead and Clinton is a liar, a moron and horny bastart). You somehow managed to invent a voting scheme by Americans, for Americans which Americans couldn't understand. There is even a comedy TV show in Canada called "Talking to Americans" which actually exploits and laughs at your complete idiocy. They go around and get "Smart Americans" (kind of an oxymoron) to discuss issues related to other countries which are complete bullshit for example many Americans begged Canada to stop the Saskatchewan seal hunt, congradulated them on getting thier first kilometer of paved road, and urged them to switch to the 24 hour clock (we have been on the 20 hour clock for ever you see). They interviewed everyone from Al Gore to Harvard students and Harvard professers. They all made complete idiots out of themselves. The only reason that the United States produces so many top university students is because of volume. The vast majority of Americans are complete morons however if you throw everything at the wall something sooner or later will stick. America has a huge population. Although a larger precentage of them are complete morons a few lucky ones are smart. There are more smart people in the United States because there are more people. Even though other countries have more smart people per million America ignores that fact and concentrates on quantity rather than quality.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Canada is no where close to being communist. Despite what you may think, Canadians are not stupid, igloo-making yokels who all say "eh" and worship the mighty US.I find these comments particularly insulting coming from Utah, which is one of the most ass-backward states I have ever been to, and I have been to about half of them. The reason that you didn't see many black or hispanic people in Victoria is that there are way fewer of them in Canada in general. Unlike you, we did not keep slaves for 200 odd years. The idea that only rich people get health care is asinine as well. That would eb the US you are referring to, where poor people get jack shit. Maybe you should pull you jack-booted foot out of your fascist ass and fucking get a clue about what you re talking about before you write something. There are a lot of great people in the US, but it's ignorant fucks like the author of this article that make people in other countries dislike Americans.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
