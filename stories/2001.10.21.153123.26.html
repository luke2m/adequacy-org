<em>Summary</em><p>


The hole in the ground could be a hole in the ground anywhere. Actually, the TV footage looks like an out take from a cheap science fiction movie shot in a landfill. <br>
We never see any bodies. <br>
Much larger pieces of wreckage are recovered from the WTC site, along with parts of tied up stewardesses and the black boxes. 
Neither I, nor anybody I've queried, have ever seen an aircraft crash site where there was no wreckage. No seats. No luggage. No pieces of wing nor fuselage. "No piece bigger than a cigarette package." And spread over nine miles. 
<p>

<em>Conclusion </em><p>


It would seem that this plane was taken out by a hell of a missile. Perhaps one designed to destroy a nuclear armed bomber and cook the payload. This was the last plane to go down and was a long way from its assumed target, so the US military had plenty of time to scramble a fighter and blow it out of the sky. Initial reports put a fighter on the scene. Further, Cheney announced that the President ordered it shot down... but then the PR disaster reared its ugly head. The Passengers were trying to retake the aircraft and given a few more minutes might have succeeded. They decide to circle the wagons and lie but the Governor of Pennsylvania has either been informed or has found out on his own so they appoint him to the position of 'Terrorist Czar' and sign him to the 'Official Secrets Act.' He is effectively silenced. The Administration quickly praises the brave passengers and claims that the struggle caused the plane to crash. 
<p>
And if you believe all that, then I recently received an email from Nigeria soliciting my help in endeavouring to move some abandoned funds there, to my account here in Canada, that you might be interested in. 

<p>
The question that bothers me is... Why haven't the international media been all over this? I can understand the major media in the US dummying up on orders from the US Administration (I wonder if this wasn't what Bob Woodward was alluding to when he admitted on TV to quashing a story a couple of weeks ago "for the good of the country") but why is the international media keeping mum? It seems obvious that the US Administration has lied but nobody jumps on it. Why? <br>
There's something very wrong here...      <br><br></div>

Networks used ten year old file footage to go with their stories of celebrations in palestine. They could just as easily have used file footage to provide visuals for a plane wreck, where the government was preventing first hand shots.
<BR>

<BR>
The cell-phone calls could easily have been edited to eliminate the incriminating explosion. I suspect that many more calls were being made, but only those that offered the best PR spin were released. In fact, the cell phone calls we heard were most likely a complete fabrication, invented by PR wizards to add a human face to a tragedy marked by the complete lack of a human element to attach to it.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the plane not showing up on radar, who's radar are we talking about here? Yours? In any case, the USAF has at least four radar transparent fighter planes capable of eliminating a jetliner.
<BR>

<BR>
The black box could also have been fabricated. It's highly likely that the US government simulated a plane wreck to cover up their mishandling of the pennsylvania plane. They probably recovered the flight recorder from a plane wrecked by remote control, for PR purposes.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, when the president orders all planes grounded, it goes almost without saying that any planes defying this order will be subject to military action. In this case it did not. It just didn't get reported on CNN, since the president looks bad when he directs the armed forces to sacrifice innocent lives.
<BR>

<BR>
Try and read between the lines in the future. The government doesn't come right out and parade its corruption right in front of you, you know.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

They grounded all the planes, got bush in the air for a couple of days and then shot down everything that was in the air. Then the media made sure to portray the people on the plane as "heroes" to make sure that if any news of the planes being shot down got out into the mainstream it would not look too bad for the administration.

If you don't want to talk about it, leave.  If you don't want people forming their own opinions about it, you're SOL.  I personally find the story to be outside the realm of credibility.  Classic conspiracy theory construction is almost the reverse of a deductive argument.  With a deductive argument, you eliminate all possible explanations until only one remains.  With a conspiracy theory, you accept all evidence that appears to be sinister and doesn't directly contradict your own premise, and you reject any and all evidence that could possibly lead to a conclusion other than the sinister one you wish to achieve.  Anyone not with you is against you, or part of the conspiracy.  Really, without going into the details of why I don't believe this explanation its hysterical pitch of paranoia ought to speak for itself as a warning to take each and every "fact" presented in the litany with a large grain of salt.<BR><BR>The real world doesn't work that way.  In the real world, the entire nation reacted to the terrorist attacks with disjointed confusion.  I find it hard to believe that the government could have mounted so swift a response <i>and</i> covered it up without so much as an innuendo remaining.  But if you look at the "evidence" which we're supposed to buy here you don't see a lot that isn't purely circumstantial or simply beyond our ability to examine.  No one here has come forward with an authoritative dissection of the crash.  No one has come forward with a testable hypothesis.  It's just a lot of very vivid speculation going on between the lines.  Not a lot is known about the last crash, and the media hasn't talked it up, leaving plenty of room for the maniacs to speculate.  The <i>day</i> of the attacks I remember seeing a Mojo discussion board speculating that the Bush administration had orchestrated the attacks to shore up public opinion by starting a war.  Now, <i>that's</i> quite hysterical and of the tenor I would expect after an event of this kind.  Just go read snopes if you want to see how many zany myths have sprung up in the wake of this attack alone.  They're going to have to make a whole website devoted to them before long.  That in and of itself is yet another reason to take everything said about this event with tremendous incredulity.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So what your saying is that readers of the famous and controversial website <a href="../index.html">adequacy.org</a> don't work for the FTC you can discount their opinions without using logic and coherent argument to prove a point?
<BR><BR>
First of all, I don't see what the Federal Trade Commission has to do with anything.  Secondly that is a logical fallacy called an ad hominem attack.  On the controversial website <a href="../index.html">adequacy.org</a> we generally prefer that you stay within the bounds of logic.  
<BR><BR>
You say it is ridiculous to think that the government shot down a civilian aircraft but ridiculous things happen all the time.  You remind me of the people who said 
<a href="./2001.9.11.92825.3403.html#14">
it was ridiculous </a> to think that anyone could learn to fly a comercial jet by using Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Three hours later when CNN was reporting that the terrorists practised flying for months using Microsoft Flight Simulator these people they looked pretty darn stupid.

Except that's not true.  Anyone who has watched the news over the last 10 years has seen plane crashes.  You don't have to be a super genius to ask yourself, "How does this crash compare with other crashes I have seen?"  That's all the author is asking you do to.
<BR><BR>
Personally, I haven't looked at a lot of the footage of the crash site.  No one filmed the actual crash and the plane didn't crash into a building so it didn't get as much air time as the other crashes.  Also it has been too long since the last time I saw footage of the crash site for me to make conclusive judgements about the matter.  
<BR><BR>
The author sugests that the plane was blown to bits before it hit the ground.  I actually doubt that this was the case.  
<BR><BR>
It seems pretty clear that something caused an explosion in the plane or to the outside.  Someone inside the plane had time to tell the 911 operator that the plane was going down and that the explosion caused "white smoke."
<BR><BR>
If the plane had been blown to bits by a missile then the person inside the plane wouldn't have had time to talk about the "white smoke."

It's likely their contingency plan, in the event that their target was unattainable, was to simply crash the plane and at least kill the passengers onboard and themselves.  They were prepared to die, after all.  They certainly would not have wanted the shame of failing compounded by the risk of being interrogated by the authorities.  You see, the reason I'm so incredibly skeptical of this story is that there is a much simpler, more reasonable explanation available that already fits the facts and doesn't require me to make too many fitful leaps of fancy to figure out.<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT></td>

Take the average force yeild of your missile of choice.  How much energy is this?

Now, take the energy of a plane being driven directly into the ground.  Lets say, for the purpose of this exercize, the plane was stopped almost instantly.  So, you have a jetliner, weighing 300,000 lbs, going 700 miles per hour.  Convert that into the appropriate units, then use your good old friend e = m * v^2.

      where Y is in kilotons and range is in km.
<BR>

<BR>
   [http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq5.html]
<BR>

<BR>
Given that formula, and a yield for the AIM-26A (250 Tons),
<BR>
the various blast radii would be:
<BR>

<BR>
    1 psi = 0.25^0.33 * 2.20 = 1.39km = 0.86mi = 4540 feet
<BR>
    3 psi = 0.25^0.33 * 1.00 = 0.63km = 0.39mi = 2059 feet
<BR>
    5 psi = 0.25^0.33 * 0.71 = 0.45km = 0.28mi = 1478 feet
<BR>
   10 psi = 0.25^0.33 * 0.45 = 0.28km = 0.17mi =  897 feet
<BR>
   20 psi = 0.25^0.33 * 0.28 = 0.18km = 0.11mi =  581 feet
<BR>

<BR>
&gt; You blow up a nuke it sends shit all over the place. Blow
<BR>
&gt; up a plane kill every person within a 100 mile radius.
<BR>

<BR>
WRONG. See above and:
<BR>

<BR>
Given that the 1 psi radius is the "window shattering" range,
<BR>
beyond which effects are minimal to non-existant, and given
<BR>
a 250T yield on an AIM-26A air-to-air nuclear missile, with
<BR>
a resultant 4540 foot radius at the 1 psi effect, and given
<BR>
that commercial aircraft cruise at about 30,000 feet, it is
<BR>
unlikely, aside from a big colorful cloud in the sky followed
<BR>
by very very small pieces of aircraft, that anyone would even
<BR>
notice if the Pennsylvania airliner had been hit with an
<BR>
atomic air-to-air weapon.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt; They best thing we got is napalm and thats for taking a
<BR>
&gt; biohazardous shit.
<BR>

<BR>
I won't even bother debunking this one.

Black boxes (they are actually bright orange) are designed to withstand plane crashes.  The black boxes from the Pentagon and Pennsylvania
 have been recoverred but apparently they are both

(Once there was a case in the Netherlands where nobody ever found the black box but there has never been a case where the black box was recoverred but was unreadable).

There exists in the cockpit a pilot-accessable fuse that can be pulled to shut off the two black boxes.  Any amount of training in those aircraft includes fuse diagrams, so its not hard to find out which fuses it'd take.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Oh yes, let me tell you.  Death's icy embrace awaits you.  And me.  And every single person you have ever known.  Everyone they have ever known.  Or ever will know.  Every single one of us, past, present and future, is without any doubt, <i>doomed</i>.
<BR><BR>
What does death mean?  It means and eternity of utter void, silence, total entropy, pure infinite lack.  It is the end, and it is an end totally lacking in meaning, purpose or any hint of ultimate sense.
<BR><BR>
It's just over, and you might as well have never lived.  No one's life, ever, will mean a single thing.  It's really hard to find the words to express the completeness of the vacuum. The finality of it.  The purity of the senselessness.  Anything like hope or desire or the even the lowest of human virtures is irrelavent.  It just doesn't matter when buried by the weight of eterinity.

... you to mention God.  He is obviously not in your heart, why should I expect to find Him in your writings?  I've seen far to many young people wander the dark path of denial- denial of His divine plan for you and me.  Anyway, if by 'eternity of annihiliation' you mean 'eternity of Hellfire' then I'd have to agree; <i>some</i> of us do have an eternity of annihiliation awaiting us after death.

You tell me.  A person who writes what you wrote is obviously a libertine.  "All bets are off!  All that awaits us is an infinte void, so if it feels good do it!"  If not that, at the very least it indicates that you have not been living according to God's Plan, which is reason enough to repent.  So, I can count at least one reason to be penitent, only you know the others...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Any thinking person would be forced to decide that being virtuous and decent is the only thing worth doing in our otherwise meaningless life.  There is no meaning or purpose other than what we choose to create.
<BR><BR>
Godism, on the other hand, makes it all into just a game.  Play by a few cute rules, and you win.  Look at how Isolde got away with decieving the court, yet telling the "truth" in the eyes of God.  The same trivilzation of life allows Christians to be perfectly evil people (St. Augustine) but then to conveninetly jump on the Godist bandwagon when the time is ripe (i.e., they are too old an sore to fornicate, kill and steal anymore) and are welcomed into the bosom of Jesus as repentant sinners.  No harm, no foul.  Everyone's a sinner, after all, so who cares what you did?  A person could get away with murder that way.

Why is it when a little tragedy comes along that everyone is overtaken by this mortal fear of what they don't understand.  Everyone always preached to me "When you are on your deathbed, you will be repenting."  and you know what?  I was laying on my death bed 1 year ago, told that I probably wouldn't wake up in the morning and that the emergency surgery was probably not going to be successful.  Not a spark, not a twinge, not a word from God, just me.  That's when I realized it, this is all there is, I better hold onto life because this is the last stop.

<BR>
Your gods and creators are the problem here.  Religion is to blame.  Think of any large destruction of human life and look who is to blame.  8 times out of 10 it is religion.  The catholic religion alone is responsible for more death throughout history than just about any other determining factor.  Holy wars, Jihads, Crusades, Inquisitions.  Killing for religion, something I don't understand.
<BR>

<BR>
Wake up people.  It's time we evolved to the next stage of human existance and leave superstition where it belongs.  In the hands of the primitive.  But we must police the primitive it seems now, or their superstitions will lead them to try to destroy our advanced society.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

What are we supposed to make our decision based on?  The paltry information given out by the US government, who has admitted to having fighter jets following the plane but denied shooting it down?  Who has not released to the cockpit information recovered from the crash?

There are vast reserves of oil sitting under the Caspian Sea; these oilfields <b>have already been bought</b> by American companies. The crux is building a reliable pipeline to get the oil out of there. Basically, there are two choices here:

<BR><BR>

1. Through Chechnya and Turkey. Russia is against this; in fact, the war in Chechnya is largely about control of oil transfer routes.

<BR><BR>

2. Through Afghanistan, through Pakistan, and on to the Indian Ocean. This involves subduing Afghanistan, though if push comes to shove, Pakistan is likely to get pissed off and start acting rashly. Remember that Pakistan has nuclear weapons, too!

<BR><BR>

All in all, a very scary situation. The oil pipeline is stuck between two very unfriendly nations with nuclear weapons. 

<BR><BR>

P.S. There is another option, theoretically -- to bypass Pakistan through Iran, but at this point in time it's completely unrealistic, IMO.

In the long run, an increasingly westernized Iran just might be a better choice than unstable, dirt-poor, founded-as-the-world's-first-islamic-nation Pakistan.  But either choice presupposes a nice stable puppet regime in Afghanistan, which I'm having trouble imagining at the moment.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This was the last plane so there was more time to shoot it down.  
<BR><BR>
This plane was headed to Camp David--an obvious target--which was more heavily protected than say Podunkville Minnesota.
<BR><BR>
Some <a href="./2001.10.21.153123.26.html#7">posters </a>doubt that the government would shoot down a civilian plane.  The government clearly said it was willing to.
<BR><BR>
One poster <a href="./2001.10.21.153123.26.html#6">
questioned</a> the information about the phone call.  The post-gazette says it was a phone call between a man and a 911 dispatcher not a man and his wife.  But the important thing is that <i>both</i> sources agree on the content of the conversation.  
<BR><BR>
Another poster claims to have 
<a href=" 
 http://adequacy.org/?op=comments;sid=2001/10/21/153123/26;cid=19#19 ">
first hand information</a> that the plane was brought down by passengers.  But then his post only talks about the passenger <i>preparing</i> to bring down the plane.  No one debates this point.  The question is did the government shoot the plane down first?  If the passangers brought down the plane what caused the explosion and the white smoke?  Explosives are not allowed on planes and the terrorists themselves were armed with knives.
<BR><BR>
If the government did shoot down the planes I would support them.  If they lied about it, I guess I would support that too.  The responses to this article show that most people would not act rationally if they were told the that the government shot a civilian plane so I understand it if the government covers up information.
<BR><BR>
I have relatives in the armed forces and I know they keep sensitive information secret from strangers and even their wives and family.  If an airforce pilot shot down the plane he wouldn't tell anyone unless authorized.

You do not know what you are talking about.  Camp David has a short company of Marines with weaponry to match.  If they have anything more, then it's been added in the last decade and .. I doubt they would do that.  The place is supposed to be a retreat, not an armed camp.

<BR>
FWIW, I was assigned to Camp David as a security guard, late 80s.

"If an airforce pilot shot down the plane he wouldn't tell anyone unless authorized."
<BR>

<BR>
You say you have relatives IN the military, I've been IN the military and this sort of thing would quickly leak out.  We'll keep secrets about important stuff, but I think the air scout in question would be having an attack of the guilts - and he wouldn't be the only one to know.  The ground crew would note the lack of a missle when he came back.  Someone had to vector him to the target.  Etc.

<BR><BR>
The naivete of you oh-so-sophisticated internet geniuses never ceases to amaze me.  Major  international media companies are controlled by the same supply-and demand rules that force the American media to spread disinformation and propaganda.  As Noam Chomsky points out in <a href="www.zmag.org/chomsky/talks/9103-media-control.html">this revealing article</a>, as long as free-market economics reign supreme, any media outlet will use profit as the main indicator of which stories to cover and how to portray the facts.  Those that do not do this will quicky be displaced in the marketplace by those that do.  Since what sells, even on an international scale, is playing up the "Americans as victims" angle of the September 11 attacks, it follows that few major international media outlets will have any interest in covering a potentially controversial story such as this one.  Those who do present <a href="http://memri.org/news.html#1004015345">dissenting views</a> are quicky marginalized as "extremists" by the monopolistic major media outlets.<BR><BR>As Chomsky has made clear, only when the present "free" market regime is replaced with a true democratic non-market social system with truth and facts be disseminated among the citizens of the world.  More of Chomsky's writings, as well as interviews and information about the man can be found <a href="http://www.zmag.org/chomsky/index.cfm">here</a>. <BR><BR>One more thing needs to be said.  I am sick of all the disgusting rumors about Prof. Chomsky's sex life that have been prevading the internet as of late.  These rumors are nothing but slanderous falsehoods, and anyway, what the man does in his spare time are nobody's business but his own.  Let's have no more of this nonsense about shoving frozen Milky Ways into the orifices of female graduate assistants.  If you don't like what Chomsky has to say, try debating him with facts, not lies.     <BR><BR></FONT></td>

In the first few moments after the first tower was hit....it was quite unclear what was happening.  The only thing we knew for certain was that a plane crashed into the building....then moments later...there was the unoffical....unconfirmed report that this was terrorism.  But by the time that second plane hit...it became quite clear that NYC was under attack.  About half hour after the towers were struck, it was reported that the Pentagon was hit.  And as we sat in front of our television screens horrified, confused and in utter disbelief....we learned that another plane was heading straight for the White House and TWO MORE planes leaving out of Boston were heading toward LA. Remember those planes??  Soon after, it was reported that the plane headed for our nations Capitol had been successfully intercepted....and the signals had been lost on the two Los Angeles bound planes.  That was the  first and ONLY time those words were said on the news.  As the day progressed, more and more families came forward with touching stories of calls from their loved ones aboard the White House bound plane....We were told of courageous attempts of the passengers taking over the plane and crashing it into the ground instead of its intended target....and the two LA bound planes haven't been brought up again since.

 More interesting to me was the eye witness in Pennsylvania who immediately after the attack said that he heard an explosion, looked up, and watched the plane fly into the ground.  Then later on, the exact same witness said that he hear a plane <i> with normal engine noise </i> looked up, saw it fly into the ground, and heard an explosion.

"Landing" involves attempting to use "landing gear", deceleration, proper or impromtu runways- it is a controlled attempt to bring an airplane safely to the ground. There is, need I point out, no evidence that this took place with the plane in question (uhhh, as opposed to the planes on the link provided...) The fact that the plane did not "collide" in a mid-air "collision" does not mean that it "landed" on the ground. Perhaps if this is too complex, we can simply realize that the examples used at the aforementioned site are in no way analagous to this crash. Analagously, neither are the dimensions of the wreckage. -clytoryphyl <BR><BR></FONT></td>

It's not a Good Thing by any means, but it's plausible.

There was an explosion to the plane before it hit the ground.  The plane engines failed twice and then the plane hit the ground.

This has actually been verified.  (People somehow were looking out for planes that day).

<BR><BR>
The problem with the building that it catches on fire.  Black boxes are meant to withstand crashes, but apparently the two black boxes that they found were "unreadable."  That has never happenned before even once let alone twice on the same day.

I suspect the small explosion and white smoke may have been from a failed engine restart. Injecting JP4 into a red-hot stalled turbine is a dicey affair.<BR><BR><BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The facts surrounding the downing of the fourth plane are undoubtedly odd. It's true that a case can easily be made that they indicate its having been shot down, while it is very hard to fit all the facts listed here into any theory that doesn't involve a military interception. The unusually localized crash site, the reports of explosions and smoke while the plan was still airborne, the apparent lack of significant debris. The failure of any information to emerge on exactly how the crash came about is concerning, and the absence of any visible serious investigative reporting into the peculiarities of the case also serves only to increase suspicion, although this at least can be reasonably explained by the lack of competent investigative reporting into anything these days.
<BR><BR>
However, while the 'official' explanation seems hard to justify in the face of contradictory reports, it is not impossible that it is correct. The most damning pieces of evidence tend to be single-observer accounts arising in the immediate aftermath of an extraordinary event. They are small observations, never independently verified. Past and very recent history shows us that even when carried by major news networks, reports of this kind can still turn out to be fallible. The crash site does look very different from other sites, but as has been pointed out, we are not aviation crash experts, and we do not know what a terrorist-piloted flying bomb impact should look like. Deliberately crashing the plane in order to kill the passengers in lieu of a major target is a credible explanation, and if we want to compare the resulting impact site to similar events, we don't have a lot to go on.
<BR><BR>
So if we look only at the direct and reported evidence concerning the crash, it does tend to support the theory that it was intercepted, while still allowing a--narrow--possibility that it was not. But what happens when we examine the alternative thesis?
<BR><BR>
I think we have to assume that if the plane was shot down, then subsequent action was taken to hide that fact. The standard of investigative reporting today is bad, but it's not so bad that a domestic missile strike on a large airliner could go unreported without some degree of coverup. So if a coverup happened, there are two questions to consider: why and how.
<BR><BR>
Let's start with the 'why'--the will to deceive: if the suggestion is that the government is trying to cover up the destruction of the airliner by the American military, then please explain to me: why? They are perfectly happy to tell the public that they planned to do so; according to them, the only reason they didn't is that they didn't get there soon enough. Open kimono time: yes, we tried to shoot it down. We failed, but we did try. How could reporting that they were successful actually be worse than that? Further, imagine the propaganda benefits of a successful interception. "Not only did these evil people attack our citizens, but they forced us into the horrific situation where we had no choice but to shoot down our own civilian aircraft in order to save a larger number of lives." Oh, the humanity! Surely this is a military propagandist's dream come true.
<BR><BR>
Let's put that aside, and assume for the sake of argument that they do have a valid reason to cover up a successful shootdown. You have a large plane shot out of the sky, inevitably resulting in widespread debris. You have to start by preventing access to that debris in case somebody finds evidence of military hardware or its effects. You have to keep from the media every possible transmission from the plane (or nearby) that suggested a military intercept. Then you have to silence everybody who might have received such a transmission. And everybody who might have witnessed the intercept from the ground. And everybody that any of these people might have spoken to before you identified and got to them. And every member of the military involved in the operation. And, before anyone that you miss has a chance to slip a story to them, you have to immediately silence all the media, those lovely people who balk even at editing broadcasts from the Evil One himself in case they contain coded instructions. Plus you have to convince them not to report that curious people are (presumably) being kept away from the crash site. And you have to start doing all these things <i>immediately</i>, you have to keep it up for the forseeable future, if not for ever, and you have to get it right <i>every single time</i> and not let a <i>single piece</i> of information slip out of your net.
<BR><BR>
Could this actually happen? Technically, yes. Practically, what is the likelihood that American military and intelligence agencies could achieve that level of effectiveness from a standing start? How does that probability stack up against the possibility that the reason why the impact and other associated reports seem to indicate a military shootdown is simply that we are dealing with an extraordinary event, the nature of which means that it is never going to yield up a useful quantity of simple, obvious facts.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">     I am disheartened by the lack of humorous speculation as to WHY the government would cover this up. If your hypothesis is correct, it would be perhaps one of the most flawless acts of US military action. Very small town, instant death, and by far, the lesser of two? evils. It has been pointed out, with relative insight, that this would be a propagandist's dream. It has been further speculated (more sparingly)that this fact would imply some even larger conspiracy. One that would be uncovered if the plane merely crashed into the ground with incredible force. Or, one that would be uncovered by using the least amount of missle muscle necessary. It is absurd to think that the media would portray this type of military action as improper, or even fishy. In fact, it would be far less fishy than attempting to cover up a missile strike. The point that the government might do this in order to destroy evidence of a nuclear warhead onboard is interesting, but not convincing. In addition, it is much more likely that a nuclear device would have been detonated from a tactically located garage, and not smuggled aboard a commercial airliner. To suggest an international conspiracy amongst the media -in this context- is unbelievably far-fetched. <BR><BR></FONT></td>
