		On Saturday, November 10th, author and <a href="http://www.pranksterweb.org/">Merry 
  Prankster</a> Ken Kesey died of complications from liver cancer. Kesey's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Kesey%2C%20Ken/adequacy-20">contributions 
  to literature</a> were matched only by his influence on the <a href="http://www.blackpanther.org/">counterculture</a> 
  movements of the 1960's. It would be too easy to blame the generational excesses 
  of the <a href="http://phish.com/">hippies</a> on Kesey and his Merry Pranksters. 
  With his passing we must now look deeper into the life of this man and use this 
  new vantage point to truly understand how he affected the world.         </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">During the summer of 1969 it became apparent to every sane person that the 
  <a href="http://www.ih2000.net/keking/Bra.htm">hippy movement</a> was an <a href="http://www.jambands.com/apr99/columnists/bertolet.html">unmitigated 
  disaster</a>. Born out of an admirable desire to change the world for the better, 
  by the time <a href="http://www.snoopy.com/comics/peanuts/f_profiles/html/f4e.html">Woodstock</a> 
  came about it had denigrated into nothing more than a bunch of <a href="http://www.woodstock69.com/woodstock2061.htm">filthy, 
  white college students</a> wasting their parent's money by <a href="http://www.hightimes.com/noflash.html">ingesting 
  drugs</a>, <a href="http://www.woodstock69.com/billy3.htm">taking off their 
  clothing</a> and <a href="http://www.catfighters.com/CFMUD35.jpg">rolling around 
  in the mud</a>. The root cause of this failing can be directly traced back to 
  one particular bus trip taken by Ken Kesey and his friends in 1964. 
<P> They called themselves the "Merry Pranksters", and they traveled across this 
  country with a lot of LSD and little desire to take themselves very seriously at 
  all. Pranksters indeed, to them it was all a joke. Despite the gravity of what 
  was going on around them, they chose to have fun. The <a href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm">Kennedy 
  assassination</a>, <a href="http://www.k-k-k.com/">race riots</a> and <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/af.html">Vietnam</a> 
  were no deterrent to Kesey and his gang of happy-go-lucky drifters, and this 
  reprehensible attitude was the ultimate downfall of the hippy movement. 
<P> Time and again history has shown us that the worst thing one can do in life 
  is to stop taking it seriously. These latter-day <a href="http://www.mailbits.com/goto/nero.htm">Nero</a>s 
  are the worst sort of plague on humanity, hiding behind their jaded exteriors 
  and prematurely claimed wisdom. Theirs is a condescending attitude born not 
  of perception, but of shortcomings. They would rather point and laugh than offer 
  their fellow man a helping hand or a few words of encouragement, because deep 
  down they know they are lesser creatures than those who operate with righteous 
  purpose, and they wish to destroy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055357549X/adequacy-20">holy 
  fire</a> that burns in men of noble calling. These are people who offer earnest-sounding 
  insight to the lost only to gain their poorly placed trust, then use that trust 
  against them, cackling when the mark realizes they've bought into nothing more 
  than a <a href="http://www.laureatedvd.com/charade.htm">charade</a>. 
<P> How Ken Kesey and those in his orbit became such societal vultures, and what 
  became of them afterwards, was examined in a book written by Tom Wolfe titled 
  <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380648/adequacy-20">The 
  Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</a></I>. Unfortunately, the lackluster writing of 
  Mr. Wolfe results in a book that absolutely fails to engage the reader on anything 
  but the most superficial level. Wolfe has two main problems with his writing. 
  First, he is the consummate outsider looking in, never able to tell his subjects' 
  stories effectively because he is never able to connect with them. His second 
  problem is that he desperately tries to hide his disconnection by injecting 
  his writing with lingo copped from the people he studies. It works about as 
  well as a parent trying to connect with their teen through the use of overheard 
  <a href="http://parentingteens.about.com/bldictionary.htm">high school vernacular</a>. 
<blockquote> But somehow a blue silk blazer and a big tie with clowns on it and...a... 
  pair of shiny lowcut black shoes don't set them all to doing the Varsity Rag 
  in the head world in San Francisco. Lois picks off the marshmallows one by one; 
  Cool Breeze ascends into the innards of his gnome's hat; Black Maria, a Scorpio herself, 
  rummages through the Zodiac; Stewart Brand winds it through the streets; pailettes 
  explode - and this is nothing special, just the usual, the usual in the head 
  world of San Francisco, just a little routine messing up the minds of the citizenry 
  en route, nothing more than psych food for the beautiful people, while giving 
  some guy from New York a lift to the Warehouse to wait for the Chief, Ken Kesey, 
  who is getting out of jail.<br>
  <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i> </blockquote>
This sort of nonsense doesn't make me feel like I'm a part of the 1960's San Francisco 
counterculture, it just makes me think that Tom Wolfe is a great big ol' dork. 
The whole book goes on like this, and it is very painful because by page 6 you 
realize that Wolfe is totally unqualified to write about these people. He has 
no fucking clue as to what's going on, and one can easily imagine his <a href="http://tomwolfe.com/index3.htm">impeccably 
white-suited</a> self standing amidst a <a href="http://home.arkansasusa.com/bborsodi/deercrk3.jpg">sea 
of grubby hippies</a>, taking notes like a sophomore psychology student interviewing 
a homicidal schizophrenic and trying to act like it's all routine. "Yes, yes, 
and these 'schrooms' you are taking, they are not like the ones people buy in 
the supermarket? ... I see. Tell me more about 'the herb'" 
<P> Tom Wolfe didn't stop displaying his ignorance with this book, though. In 
  1975 he published <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553380656/adequacy-20">The 
  Painted Word</a></I>, a critique of modern art from the always thrilling view 
  point of someone who doesn't understand it. He then followed up that tour de 
  force with <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/055338063X/adequacy-20">From 
  Bauhaus to Our House</a></I>, an equally uninformed look at modern architecture. 
  That's pretty much all he does. He takes subject matter that he doesn't understand 
  and then attacks it in a way that is about as revealing and provoking as political 
  commentary from a taxi driver. 
<P> You want to feel all warm and fuzzy inside about hating those people who made 
  a lot of money in the 80's? Tom Wolfe wrote <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553275976/adequacy-20">The 
  Bonfire of the Vanities</a></I> just for you. You want a superficial treatment 
  of real estate development in the early 90's? Give <I><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553580930/adequacy-20">A 
  Man in Full</a></I> a read. Don't worry about being asked to stretch your little 
  noggin around any complex character motivations. Tom Wolfe only provides you 
  with easily digestible <a href="http://www.hollywoodsouvenirs.com/cgi-bin/CatalogMgr.pl?cartID=b-4746&SearchFor=suptrekspock&template=Hhtx/standups.htx&hdr=Hollywood+Souvenirs+Product+Listing:+Standups&">cardboard 
  cutouts</a>, conveniently packaged for rapid disapproval. In Wolfe's novels 
  the world is exactly how you think it is, and he always offers comfortable reassurance 
  for us little people. 
<P> If there's one thing we can learn from Kesey's death, if there's one thing history can teach us, it's that Tom Wolfe is a fucking menace. He was bad enough when writing 
  nonfiction, but he really crossed over the line when he started publishing novels. 
  If anybody deserves to die of liver cancer, it's him.      <br><br></div>

It happens frequently -- somebody who goes through life, then suddenly he snaps, and out comes a brilliant work of art. After producing the work of art, however, the man burns out very quickly, leaving some sort of wasted shell. Kesey is one such case; rather than using the written word as a tool, to communicate some sort wisdom, to enlighten the readers about the human condition, he had a sudden, irrational flash of inspiration. The result is a brilliant work of art, but Kesey ends up battered, living the rest of his life in the shadow of his own book. The problem is that writing the book was an involuntary act, a sort of sudden "coming out"; he ended up living the rest of his life trying to measure up to the image of himself he accidentally created. Quite sad, really.

The internet?  'Net culture was spearheaded back in the 1970s by a bunch of old hippies.  Raves?  Just a computerized version of music festivals like Woodsotck.  All this nu-metal and grunge music tday is just a minor modification of the works of '60s musical pioneers like Hendrix and Cream.  Creed is just the Doors with some quasi-Christian lyrics mixed in!  Hip-hop too, is just a descendant of Black spoken word pioneers like the Last Poets and Gil-Scott Heron (the revolution will not be televised!). <BR><BR>And don't get me started about how the "permissive" lifestyles of today would never have been possible if us hippies hadn't been out shaking things up in the '60's.  The miniskirt is a classic example of '60's fashion.  The anti-golbalization protests of today are enacted directly in the spirit of the 1960s.  The designer drugs like "X", that are so popular today descend directly from the pioneering efforts of men like Kesey and Tim Leary to "open the doors of perception".<BR><BR>I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say the 1960's were the most important decade of the post war era.  The efforts of people like Kesey to make the world a freer, more understanding place are still paying off today.  So next time you see some old hippie bopping along down the street, flash him/her a peace sign and say thanks.  Maybe (s)he'll share a joint with you!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Once again you show nothing but intolerance and ignorance about any lifestyle other than your own.  You would benefit greatly by doing a little more listening and a lot less profound lecturing about things you know little about.  Have you read any of Kesey's books?  Have you read Wolfe's biography of Kesey?  There is actually a lot to be learned about personal freedoms, personal rights, and personal responsibilities from these books... not to mention the potential better understanding of the people around you that you may gain by reading these.  If you understand these books, you'll have a slightly better understanding of why you're wrong to make these assumptions.  Have you ever made an attempt to understand a lifestyle other than the one you're parents taught you?  Hell, I'll even go so far to say that you would benefit from a little drug experimentation of your own... it would most likely break you out of your relatively small realm of understanding.  In the hippy culture which you claim to know well enough to be able to summarize its meaning a few demeaning sentences, there is a deep desire for a more responsible lifestyle.  I mention this because you seem to think its all about self-gratifying over indulgence.  Once again, you couldn't be more wrong.  Of course every group has their lunatic extremists, but why do you think environmentalism is so popular among the hippy culture?  It's driven by the desire to attain a sustainable global society, which is a goal that is being overlooked by many of our world leaders.  This is just one example.  My point is that you are incorrect by saying that these people have no respect for what you recognize as good values.  Can you acknowledge that if every person on this planet lived the average American lifestyle, there would be no hope to be able to feed us all with today's available food technology... that the world would be unbearably polluted, and that none of this would be important till someone found a way to make a hefty profit doing otherwise?  There is a respectable desire in hippy culture to research, find solutions, and make changes through political channels to fix these problems.  No value for real education?  Hippy culture absolutely includes education... you tell me which is more `real'... sitting around earning an MBA so you can make a fortune, or making personal sacrifices while getting a degree in environmentalism or biology... knowing that when you graduate you wont make a fortune, but also knowing you couldn't live with yourself if you didn't try to change the world for the better.  Hmm... sounds like civic duty or something doesn't it?

Remember I'm the one that told you this a few years from now when you come to realize how ignorant you can be and yet how anxious you seem to be to convince the world of your profound analytical ability.  It'll be embarrassing for you... but we all need a little humility to put us in the right place once in a while.

I must take issue with this ignorant and unhistorical assertion. That the hippy movement was a disaster became quite clear to anyone with even the faintest scintilla of a clue no later than the summer of 1967. The transformation of San Francisco's Haight Ashbury district from a pleasantly eccentric neighborhood to almost a war zone, with drug-addicted teenage runaways sleeping in the parks and a corresponding rise in burglaries, muggings, and police raids, had begun gradually after <i>Life</i> magazine's expos&eacute; of the counter-culture in 1964, and was quite complete by the &quot;Summer of Love&quot;.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
"A great good friend and great<BR>
  husband and father and grand dad, he will be sorely missed but<BR>
  if there is one thing he would want us to do it would be to carry<BR>
  on his life's work. Namely to treat others with kindness and<BR>
  if anyone does you dirt forgive that person right away. This<BR>
  goes beyond the art, the writing, the performances, even the<BR>
  bus. Right down to the bone.<BR>
-- Ken Babbs<BR>
<BR>
And this from me;<BR>
<BR>
The patron saint of pranksters<BR>
Like my mom once said, great souls go on to be greater.  <BR>
Ken became someone I admired when I first read his books  during the 60's in LA. I had just moved there from Ohio. There were people to talk with about history, religion, philosophy, music et al  and the world was unfolding around us.  <BR>
We had tried the local mexican dirt weed in the high school parking  lot and were talking to the low riders and guys from arizona about  mescaline and magic mushrooms. Not much info available at the  time that we were aware of, but we were curious about the way the mind works and were interested in every religion and philosophy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were surrounded by so many intense new directions to go  in.We had great literature (Tolkien, the Freep ( the LA Free Press),  Marvel comic books, All the classics, all the new books that were being published, available in the library and at a hundred bookstores, and Ken Kesey. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first way ken touched my life was in the shape of a cubed  chunk of sugar. Paul Byers one of the neighbourhood kids, ( we had  a unconventional but cool hood and a lot of us were  in our teens)  had his moms packard to get around in and had gone to the first LA  acid test. When he got back (A seperate adventure of some note)  he was bearing tales and treasure maps and the Quest began! <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what a strange journey it was and is. Further! <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time I ran into Ken was when the University of Oregon was going to put on a reading of  demon box and the technical director of the theatre Dave Shaw, A  real wizard of productions asked me to help with the show and do  the lighting. I was really shy around ken at first but made freinds quickly with Art Maddox, that wonderful, piratical piano player, and he  introduced me to Ken, ..........And, well, we took off from there. I was  honored to be a part of it and it is one of my favorite projects to  remember. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I really treasure though were the conversations we had  when we were up in the fly rigging or setting the light pipes. Ken  always had an unusual or funny way of looking at things that brought  them into perspective, that put them in your hand again in a size you  could handle.  <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shared a belly laugh. What's better than that? <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was my freind, I'll Miss him here, but I can hear him laughing  so I don 't think he's completely out of touch. He's been inspiring me  for years and thats not going to change. He sets a good example in his incredibly interesting way. He is a great teacher, a real  bodhisatva, someone who will teach my grandkids and me in the  future and countless generations as well.  If the only important thing is living in great style I'd say ken went out with aces. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever need a good bus mechanic let me know. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love you all, <BR>
