		Over the last few years, since leaving a <a href="http://www.vatican.va">Catholic</a> education, I have seen a little more of the world, and the people that are attempting to make their way within it. I'll be blunt - when it comes to Religion, I'm pretty disappointed. I am growing increasingly weary from hearing chants of <a href="http://www.matriarch.com/case.htm">`Religion is evil'</a> on the one hand, <a href="http://megagift.com/hell/">`If you won't allow yourself to be saved by Jesus you'll go to hell'</a> on the other and everything else in between. <br><br>

The issue, in my opinion is not that Religion is a problem - or even the lack of belief in one (as some believe) - but rather humanity as a whole in its blinkered state refuses to allow individuals to think for themselves. Everything you know and believe about Religion has been spoon fed to you since you were a child and even if you abhor Religion, your attitudes to it are most likely nothing more than an ill-founded reaction that you are too lazy to think about and here I'm going to try and challenge those thoughts.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Here is a premise to give some background to my theory on Religious belief in the modern day: Absolutely nothing in this world is original. Every piece of art, literature, engineering, is an abstract copy of something that has been learnt or experienced by its creator(s) previous to them embarking or completing their creation. With language, this is simple to prove. We learn our native tongue as a child from those around us, and from then on all the language we use is composed of the words we have been taught within a given context previously, placed in a different order - e.g. we are taught that `table' is a noun given to a free-standing structure we place objects upon. We are taught that `God' is the name of an omnipotent being many believe is our Father. If I create a piece of art, a letter, or even this article, I am drawing on previous experience and inspiration. If this is not an abstract form of plagiarism then I'm a <a href="http://www.allposters.com/Galleryc.asp?aid=999826&parentaid=0&item=96696">melting watch</a>. I am proposing that Religion - and yes, it does deserve a capital `R' - is no different, and that is why we not only have groups of individuals who appear deluded into believing somebody else's ideas, but we in addition have the opposite group who are incapable of constructing an argument any further than `your Religion sucks'.<br><br>

I started thinking about this some years ago, when I first attempted to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0425152251/qid=998767928/sr=8-2/ref=aps_sr_b_1_2/104-5396695-0106302">Sophie's World</a>. A book written in a style that would suggest it is suitable for a child, concerning philosophy - in other words, Religion (or at any rate, Theology) in another name. The book is enjoyable, and is recommended to any of you who feel you need a very gentle introduction into the art of philosophy. At the time it didn't strike me profound, but there is a discussion in the book about how people came to believe in <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/thor.html">Thor</a>. The general idea was, people were sitting around one day trying to work out what thunder and lightning was all about. With a lack of knowledge concerning <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/lightning.htm">how lightning works</a> the best explanation they could come up with was an angry God with a mighty tool (his hammer) was striking the sky. Belief and worship in Thor did not require human sacrifice, as was the case with his `father' Odin, so we are given some insight as to why he became popular. The point I am attempting to make is that what we see here is the foundation of religion - the attempt to explain something that is not currently explainable in terms that can be understood by the people of the time. Thor's hammer was an acceptable belief in what caused thunder and lightening.<br><br>

Today is a different World however. We don't behave like that. We don't hear a clap of thunder, and assume it is an angry God. However, we also don't try and form our own beliefs and opinions ourselves anymore. The Vikings <a href="http://www.omnipresents.com/worship.html">created Gods to explain phenomena</a> that they could not explain through any other means. In today's World where Science is the pop-Religion of reason, when we need to seek spiritual guidance, we mimic others. The worst thing is, those individuals who claim to abhor Religions are just as guilty of this ignorance and laziness as those who hold them true to their hearts. The evidence for this is obvious, simple, and I'm really hoping that somebody is going to point out the thoughts I'm having are not original in the slightest.<br><br>

I was brought up as a Catholic. I was never baptised - my father suggested successfully to the rest of my family as a lapsed-protestant, that I should make my own mind up when I was old enough - however I went to Catholic schools until the age of 16. It will come as no surprise to you then, that as a child I held mostly <a href="http://www.catholic.org/prayer/beliefs.html">Catholic beliefs</a> about God, Jesus, how to live one's life and so on. That is because I was living in a `Catholic context'. I would be as equally unsurprised to discover that a child born and raised into a Jewish family and culture would on the whole, <a href="http://www.mishpacha.org/indexbelief.shtml">believe in the Jewish faith</a> rather than the Catholic faith. This is part of the problem. As children we are spoon fed Religion and it is taken as truth. When we ask our fathers what makes the car go, and he describes an engine and it's workings and interactions with the magical petrol within, it is with no more or less truthfulness in his face and manner than when he may describe as to why we should pray on a regular basis. Equally, our family, our peers (who are likely to come from similar families and cultures) and even our teachers are people who we believe in and trust. As children, we accept this, and we grow into adult life with many of these beliefs intact.<br><br>

At this point, one of two things can happen - these beliefs stay with us into adult life, and we continue to preach our beliefs. Or, some may decide that everything they have been taught is no more meaningful to life and existence than stories about the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny. They may reject Religion in its entirety. They may create Websites describing <a href=""http://foody.org/seventhheaven.html">everything that is wrong with Religion</a>. They will deem that all Religion is wrong, that it has created more misery and suffering on this planet than any other force. Some will call for it to become illegal. Others will even claim that <a href="http://www.believers.org/tr113.htm">with organised Religion you will never find Jesus and make God happy</a>. However, these individuals are often guilty of exactly the same crime that evangelists and believers are criticised for - pomposity and laziness.<br><br>

Without challenging your own thoughts, beliefs, culture and even the way you were brought up, you are going to fall into one of two camps - those who believe in something because they were brought up to believe it, or those who <i>don't</i> believe in something because they were brought up to believe it. This latter category can be extended into those people who practise `alternative' religions - they reject, say, Christianity, and take up, say, Paganism. They have swapped out one set of somebody else's beliefs for another set of somebody else's beliefs. This, I truly believe, is what is wrong with the world. In fact, I think wars are fought not because beliefs are different, but because opposing sides can't accept that anybody who thought about Religion should come up with any other belief than the one they hold themselves. In other words, the Anti-Religion lobby is just as bad at creating disharmony as those groups they make so much effort in criticising.

Let's do a little thought experiment. We're going to define `God'. In a way that is not in current use in the World today by any organised Religion I know of. Should be fun. This is normally known as 'amateur religion' or <a href="http://www.metrotimes.com/20/07/Features/newDiy.htm">'DIY religion'</a>.<br><br>

OK, the one school of thought that has challenged the organised Religions of this World for centuries is Science. Many who leave the Christian churches do so under the name of science, and many who wish to remain within the fold will challenge Science (evolution theory, and so on). How about this then - God is Science. Science is God. Think. No, don't just sit there shouting. God created the Universe (big bang theory). He causes miracles (probability theory), he is omnipotent (laws of physics apply everywhere in the Universe), he did create life (biology) and evolution is his chosen method of developing life, it could even be argued that he requires our worship (inherent in humans is our curiosity at the Universe around us, how it is made, and seeing as God made us, and we are seeking him, etc.) - anyway you get the idea. Why is this any more valid a Religion or less valid a Religion than any other? It isn't. I've done exactly the same as every other primitive human on this planet (don't argue we're not primitive - just because we have McDonalds doesn't mean we've reached the pinnacle of evolution) and decided that as I can't define how all this marvellous science exists, and how the Universal laws can just `be' that I shall call them collectively `God'.<br><br>

It even has a suggestion as to what happens if we die (we rot into the earth through a process <i>most</i> people don't <i>really</i> understand), yet leaves room for future amendment towards an after-life (we are always learning about science, we don't really know a gret deal yet, etc.) If I hold it as my belief, am I achieving any more enlightenment than any other human being? Probably not, but at least I know one thing - I put some effort into my belief. That process alone means that I am attempting to understand the Universe around me, in my own terms rather than somebody else's. I'm also putting effort into understanding other's beliefs. If we all did this, how would the World change?<br><br>

I am not suggesting that the above description of `God' is a suitable grounding for a belief or Religion. What I am trying to show is that anybody can challenge the beliefs around them, produce something abstract, and test these thoughts out in their own heads without consequence - in fact, some Churches are so scared of you doing this, they will tell you that you will go to Hell (or equivalent) if you entertain such thoughts. To not go through this process at some point in your life, means you have just become another one of `them' - chances are, you vote the same way your parents did. You hold the same set of values and morals as those that you grew up with, or your current peers. You're just not thinking, are you?<br><br>

If you go away and think about this, and you work really, really hard, you read as much as you can, you play games in your mind about your beliefs and the beliefs of those around you and you challenge everything in the World around you and try to redefine it all in terms of what you think you should believe, and at the end of it you decide that Jesus was our Saviour, nobody can point the finger and say you're an idiot. Nor can they if you decide that all Religion is stupid. Or if you decide that God is really just another name for the combined laws of Science. Because you can turn around and say `at least I made the effort'.

A choice such as this isn't made on sabatical, not made by talking with your peers, and not shoved down your throad in a school.  Ironically, I came to this end by way of a Catholic university, and through the studies of Native American cultures and religion, and how some tribes were able to not only embrace Catholicism, but to incorporate it into their existing religion, adding new insight.<BR><BR><BR><i>I am not who you think I am.</i><BR></FONT></td>

We're discussing matters of the immortal soul, not some sort of popularity contest. Why is it important to `challenge everything in the World around you'? Will it make you more likely to pick the true religion, or is it simply so you can say `at least I made the effort' (like that'll make any difference if you're wrong). It seems to me that the article is saying that what is important in a religion is that it works for you, which is true, <i>if you're already an atheist</i>. If you believe in absolute truth and a real God then it doesn't matter if God doesn't `work for you' - it doesn't make him any less real or omnipotent.

<BR><BR>In fact I would argue that challenging everything in the world around you and creating your own DIY religions will lead you to create an elaborate system of self-justification, rather than bring you any closer to God.

I should probably have chosen a different phrase from `closer to God' - I didn't mean `closer to my God', but rather `closer to an understanding of the Divine, assuming that it exists'. Similarly, for the rest of this post you can assume that `God' expands to `God / Allah / Bazil Brush / some sort of Universal life force / The Divine / whatever'.
                                                                                     <BR><BR>I'm an agnostic / atheist actually. I think all religions are pretty silly, but the idea that you can self-consciously create your own personal religion and expect it to be anything but a collection of your own foibles and desires is beyond silly and into ludicrous. It's also the wrong way round - you don't change God in response to yourself, you change yourself in response to God. Making up your own personal religion is changing God in response to yourself.

<blockquote>that is the whole point of the article. Your God was "created" by your ancestors to suit them. He was written about and preached about by mortal men; yet you are criticising people for doing the same thing now.</blockquote>

I have a problem with people cobbling together their own DIY religion, or advocating people should do the same. They seem to be admitting that we really know nothing about the truth of God, the afterlife, the meaning of the universe and so on, and then suggesting as a solution that we <i>make stuff up</i>.

I think you also might want to re-read the article but replace every occurence of the word 'Religion' with the words 'Belief System' and see if that helps you understand what I was getting at. For most people who have a strong stance on Religion, their Belief System IS that stance, and so it made sense in the context of the article to talk about Religion specifically.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

But it did not happen through education, through talking to my peers, when I reached adulthood, or during a sabatical.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There are certain things that it's okay to encourage children to question critically.  For example, much of modern science .. the biggest culprits being evolution and the Big Bang.  In secularistivic schools children are taught these theories as facts and are not encouraged to ask tough questions about them.  Evolution in particular is a shameful case; children are not taught that the theory is physically, thermodynamically, and Scripturally impossible.  We would do well to teach our children to question these theories and ultimately reject them as common sense, decency, and morality require.<BR><BR>

However, when you start to encourage children to question salvation through Christ, you are putting them in harm's way.  Has it occurred to you that the reason that so many people believe in the doctrine of Christianity is because it's true?  Think about it; Christianity is universally accepted by all Christian scholars.  Not "a bunch" of them, or "most" of them .. <i>all</i> of them.  Ninety percent of Western civilization believes in the divinity of Christ and salvation through accepting Him as a personal Savior.  This all but proves that Christianity is true and that all other religions (past and present) are damnable heresies and their adherents are on a collision course with unimaginable torture and pain.<BR><BR>

So in this case .. asking questions is bad.  Children <i>should</i> be taught about Christ.  In fact, many have suggested that this should be mandated by law.  I can't exactly go along with this as it arguably violates the First Amendment in its current form.  However, it is good policy, and it's good parenting.  Telling children to forget about Christ and to go out and play around and research make-believe religions (or no religion at all) and "if it feels good, do it" is horrible parenting.  It's no different than encouraging them to play Russian Roulette.  Let your child's mind run free when it comes to Earthly matters, but when it comes to matters of universal truth it is our duty as parents to keep them on the straight and narrow no matter the cost.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

That is common knowledge.  Jewish persons and atheists make up most of the rest.  There are some Muslims here and there but as far as I'm concerned, they aren't worth counting.  It would be nice if those people would stay on <i>their</i> side of the planet and blow up their <i>own</i> buildings, but I suppose this is the price we pay for the liberalousness of our leftivist "melting pot" immigration philosophy.

It isn't my suggestion.  It's God suggestion .. nay, it is God's <i>requirement</i>.  Not teaching your children about Jesus is irresponsible.  If you go further and teach them that the Bible is anything other than inerrant truth and that Jesus is not their Savior, then you have (IMHO) committed child abuse and should be put in front of a judge.  If you don't believe, then fine.  You are old enough to know better, and are mature enough to face the consequences of your rejection of the Lord.  But children are young and impressionable and any decent society cannot allow institutionalized atheism to seize them at such a young age and destroy any and all hope for their eternal life.  I realize that you probably think this is all a load of bunk, but I'm trying to explain where I'm coming from.<BR><BR>

Of course not.  A scholar is one who considers <i>all</i> sources, and thinks enough to realize that scientific "facts" are really nothing more than the best theories we have at the present.  In addition, a true scholar takes a closer look at the Bible that most so-called scientists and realizes that inside it are real, immutable truths.

Loving your neighbor is not the point.  Preventing them from going to hell is.  As for your claim that Christianity is just a middle-eastern religion, Caeser changed all of that when he made it the Roman state religion.

<BR><BR>
Are you serious?  If you have to be convinced of something, it isn't worth knowing?  Perhaps we should throw out our knowledge of mathematics, quantum physics, and the entire dicipline of psychology--they're all things you have to be convinced of!  And if you claim that we rationally understand those, I'd have to wonder <i>who do you think you are?</i>  Most <i>rational</i> people I know understand that we know next to nothing about the true nature of the universe!

Yep.  Ever hear that Pascal gave one of the the lamest reasons for believing in Christianity.  Gee, the Muslims believe that all other religions are unsaved and will be punished as well.

There may be more than one western country, but the rest honestly don't count.  It's not like you see european culture being gobbled up by your average US citizen, do you?  Or, for that matter, Europeans (how else do we account for the global popularity of McDonalds)? It's not superiority, it's reality.

<i>Yep. Ever hear that Pascal gave one of the the lamest reasons for believing in Christianity. Gee, the Muslims believe that all other religions are unsaved and will be punished as well.

Yes, but the underlying metaphysics that give those ethics their power is all from God.  Even Socrates admitted that in his last hours.

Once again, I couldn't agree more.  Scientific facts are the best theories we have.  Certainly better than any conjecture or speculation you may pluck from the bible.  <br><br>
<i>[I]nside [the Bible] are real, immutable truths. </i><br><br>
That's a pretty lofty claim there.  Do you have any evidence to back that up?  I hope you're basing it on more than fairy tales told to you as a kid.  <i>Please,</i> I would love to some some real proof for your stance.  I would gladly admit that I am wrong if you can somehow <b>prove</b> that you are right.  (I won't accept "Just because."  That one only works on children.)
<br><br>
<i>Therefore, it's not really worth counting in the western world (the United States).</i><br><br>
Whoa!  That's certainly a new one.  The Western World is <b>NOT</b> just the US.  Are you an American?  Try looking at a map.<br><br>
<i>Loving your neighbor is not the point. Preventing them from going to hell is.</i>
<br><br>
Uh, did you ever <i>read</i> the bible?  Loving your neighbor was the most important part of Jesus's message.  Now, I admit that that's only in the New Testament, so maybe you haven't gotten that far yet, but I'd be carefull what you say.  It doesn't look so good when an 'infidel' knows more about your religion than you do.  (For the record, I guess the reason I did reject religion is because I know too much about it.)  <br>
And it's not your job to keep other's from going to hell.  That's between me and God, whatever He may be.<br><br>
<i>As for your claim that Christianity is just a middle-eastern religion</i><br><br>
Christianity (along with it's predecessor, Judaism,) originated in the middle east. That's a fact, pure and simple.  If you live in America, that does not mean that Christianity is an American concept.  In fact, about 68% of Christians live in the Eastern hemisphere.  The Pope lives over there too.  (For the record, I <i>do</i> know that he's Catholic and that not all Christians are Catholic.)  <br><br>
<i> And as for your insinuation that the holocaust was a Christian institution</i>
<br><br>
I didn't say it was a Christian institution, just that it was performed by Christians, just as those bombings you mentioned were performed by moslems.  I was just pointing out that you lived in a glass house and shouldn't be throwing stones.  <br><br>
<i>I would caution you against "trolling"</i><br><br>
Well, I appreciate your concern, and in return urge you to look up the definition of trolling.  All I'm doing is trying to hold a rational debate with someone who refuses to be rational.<br><br>
<i>If you have to be convinced of something, it isn't worth knowing? </i><br><br>
Oops, looks like I wasn't too clear that.  What I was trying to say there was that if something can only be convinced to a child, meaning that only someone who was easily impressionable would believe it, then it doesn't sound like something I'd want to believe.  (Do you believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy?  Kids do, but they are usually told better while still impresionable.  Is that child abuse?) <br><br> 
<i>Most rational people I know understand that we know next to nothing about the true nature of the universe!</i><br><br>
As do I, but I learned more about the universe from studying physics and mathematics than I did from reading the bible.  If I don't know how something works, though, I don't attribute it to Magic, or God.  <br><br>
<i>Ever heard of Pascal's Wager</i><br><br>
Yes, I have.  Are you saying that I should say I believe in God "just in case?"  I can't simply believe something is true or not by choice.  I can say I believe in God, but I simply cannot believe unless I am given some kind of proof.  Since all the evidence I've seen goes against Christianity, I'd have to be a fool to believe it.  <br><br>
<i>O Great Arrogant One</i><br><br>
Ok, be nice now.  Refusing to believe something because all the evidence points away from it is hardly arrogance.  Saying "I'm right and you're wrong, because I said so," on the other hand, does sound a bit arrogant.  But that's just my opinion.
<br><br>
<i>Yes, let them run wild, not introducing them to the Ethical Code! They will end up being nothing but feral animals with only their sensous desires to live for, but so be it!</i><br><br>
So you think that Ethics and Religion are mutually exclusive?  You've certainly got a lot to learn.  Have you ever studied history?  Countless atrocities thoughout history have been commited in the name of Religion.  Even today in the middle east, the birthplace of Christianity, Judaism, and Moslem, people fight over religion.  Some of the nicest people I know are atheists or agnostics, while some of the most hatefull people I've ever met go to church every sunday.  I would say that's a fluke, but I've heard the same from many people from all over.  Go figure.<br><br>
<i>People like you make me sick. I can't believe we, as a civilized society, allow you to procreate.</i><br><br>
So instead of presenting even one valid argument you're just going to resort to name calling?  I find that depressing.  I almost miss my time studying in college, because at least there I could find someone willing to at least try.  (I'm still glad I changed my major to something more practical though!)  <br><br>
<BR>As a child I wanted to know everything.  Now I miss my ignorance.<BR></FONT></td>

Casear is commonly thought to be the Great Emperor to bring Christianity to the Roman Empire. This is just false. Casear was the first Emperor of Rome, not necessarly the same as the first Christian Emperor of Rome. Dante's Inferno makes the same mistake.

So a "scholar" (I have to use quotes because you are redefining the term) is someone who questions scientific "facts" but takes the Bible as "truth" at face value?  So basically only Christians can become these new "scholars" and anyone who does not believe the Bible is the direct word of god is what, a heretic?<BR><BR>

I think god would want us to question its authority, because if it is really the all-powerful being it claims to be then the evidence would point to that and we could all worship secure in the knowledge that we found the "real thing".  If god didn't want us to question it, it wouldn't have given us free will (as the Bible says).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>Ninety percent of Western civilization believes in the divinity of Christ and salvation through accepting Him as a personal Savior</i><br><br>

I have some news for you. There are vast swathes of Western civilization that aren't Christian. I think the figure '90%' needs to be dropped to about '45-50%'. At most. Oh, and in addition, Islam will be the world's largest Religion within about 5-6 years. Imagine that.<br><br>

'no matter the cost'. That's an interesting phrase. Do you think I should be killed for suggesting children should think for themselves? Or rather, when they become adults that they should step back and think for themselves... How about killing everybody who doesn't conform to your Religion? That will keep them on the 'straight and narrow'. What a wonderful idea.<br><br>

Since language is inherently creative, and every normal (e.g. not having some medical defect) human being possesses language, it follows that every human being is creative, contrary to the "point" you are trying to make.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I remember becoming an atheist when I went to school (a state run school in the UK) and in the assembly hall realising that I didn't believe a word of the religious service. It was quite strange at first, but being a fairly secure child, I never lied about it, or pretended to believe it. How could I ? My own parents were atheists and they wouldn't lie to me :-)<BR><BR>
My only regret is that my parents would not write a letter to the school to excuse me from the publicly funded indoctrination that was going on.<BR><BR>
As a young atheist, I was quite smug about it, looking at all the adults who were stupid enough to believe all that rubbish in holy books, believing in it like the tooth fairy or santa claus. As a five year old child, there was more hard evidence for the existance of santa claus than there was for the Christian God. Parents encouraging their kids to believe in santa claus and the tooth fairy are equipping them with an practical lesson in religios faith which should turn them athiest the moment they find out the truth<BR><BR>

Later in life I realised that the spirit of the dominant religion colours our behaviour, even down to our sense of right or wrong. I began to realise with some degree of concern that although I was an atheist, culturally I was a Christian. In the sense that my ideas of what are right and wrong come from a Christian perspective (forgiveness, not coveting my neigbours ass etc). I now make a point of questioning whether I really think something is right or wrong, or whether it is the 'stealth christian' implanted in me by the state that is dictating my behaviour.
<BR><BR>Later it became clear that you cannot tell someone what is right or wrong without some sort of authority, since they will just disagree with you, with an equal amount of authority. A 'divine' character must be invented who is 'better' than you and who you will therefore listen to without such a questioning attitude.
<BR><BR>
Its most disturbing that as atheists we live in this bizarre world where decisions are taken by people who profess to believe in all kinds of improbable deities. Its like living life inside an enormous slashdot troll with millions of biters on all sides of the argument and only a very small select group of people who have actually thought it through for themselves. I am grateful to my grandfather for having the balls and guts to give up Catholicism so that I didn't have to become one. Atheists sometimes do not realise how lucky they are to be unencumbered by 1000s of years of 'we've always done it like this' and 'because god said so, shut up' etc etc.
<BR><BR>
You also are misguided in denying the existance of an omnipotent being. Its entirely conceivable that we are the creation of a superior intelligence. This is philosophically and practically possible. The 'digital' nature of DNA should give us some cause for speculation. However should such an ompnipotent being exist, it just removes the question one step further back: Who created the omnipotent being ? Does it have to follow some religion ? If not, why not ?Is there any reason to suppose we are capable of understanding it any more than a fish in a goldfish bowl understands how it got there ?<BR><BR>
Religions are just sets of rules (like political systems) which attempt to control people's behaviour. It may not be a bad thing. Some people's behaviour needs controlling. The problem I have with it is the circular nature of the arguments and the sheer arrogance on display. <li>
Religious person: "Don't murder people you'll go to Hell." <br><li>Me: "But I don't believe in Hell. Does that mean its OK for me to murder people ?"<BR><BR>
Its a kind of bootstrap problem. Before I can start behaving in a Christian way, which I should because God will punish me if I don't, I first have to start believing in it. But if I start believing in this God it might start to punish me. So I am better off not believing in it. The arrogance is in the assumption that without Christianity I would go around murdering people at random. Fact is, it is the threat of sanction from society, in the here-and-now that deters most criminals. Not the wrath of a maybe-existant God.
<BR><BR>
Most western religions claim to be the one true religion. This files in the face of the facts. They all try to gloss over their holy books when they talk about slaughtering the unbelievers or whatever. <BR><BR>
For a good look at the results of <strong>taking religion too seriously</strong> you only need to look at Afghanistan, Ireland, The former Yugoslavia, The Sudan, and the Middle East. The arguments there are not complex, and despite all the talk of peace "processes" they will not ever be solved, since the argument boils down to "I'm right and you're wrong, because your God is not real and mine is".
<BR><BR>
I think the Bible is a huge <a href="http://www.bible.com/answers/apokemon.html">troll</a> on the world, with millions and millions of biters on both sides of the argument.
Unlike slashdot trolls however, this level of trolling must be taken seriously due to the amount of power and influence wielded by the believers. Like it or not, religious people are determining your atheist future, and a troll is still a troll, even if it is thousands of years old and has millions of people who think it is true. It is very much an 'Emperor's new clothes' situation.
<BR><BR>
Having said all that, I don't think we should get too worried by the religious people. For the most part what they do is harmless. In many cases what they do is actually good for mankind, and the vast majority of religious people take their religious rules seriously but not too seriously.<BR><BR>
Nowhere is this state of affairs more advanced than in the United Kingdom, where despite having an <a href="http://www.cofe.anglican.org/">official state religion</a>, most people go to church on only three occasions: Christenings, weddings, and funerals even though according to surveys around 80-90% of them believe in some sort of supreme being.<BR><BR>
Don't assume that the religious leaders clergy, preachers are entierly to blame for this state of affairs. After all, if slashdot didn't have such a huge number of biters, it would be hard to troll them. The slashdot biter, like the religious man, has faith. He has faith that the troll he is responding to is actually the real opinion of someone. He feels that his contribution to the discussion (however ill-advised) is positive. He feels he can make a difference. He is, unfortunately wrong.<BR><BR>

The Eastern religions are not necessarily as <a href="http://www.kwanumzen.com/pzc/newsletter/v09n10-1997-October-DKZM-KillTheBuddha.html">theistic</a> as you might think, many of them have a more philosophical approach.<BR><BR>
If you have not read them already, there are a couple of books that atheists and realists might enjoy. They contain a lot of insight into why humans are the way they are. So without further ado, I present adequacy.org's required reading list for September 2001. Study carefully. There will be a test.<BR><BR>

A lot of people go around telling others that they will go to hell.  The fact is, there is no hell.  If you read the bible, you will find out that nobody is going to hell.  You are only going to be saved, or you are not going to be saved.  You will live or you will die.  Thats it.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I see that some comments posted here are from someone who appears a bit off-base on what Christianity is.  It's not about judging others, nor about the behavior of Christians, it's about Christ.  It's not about what we have to do or not do; it's about acknowledging that we are all sinners (Christians are by no means exempt from that statement), and that being sinners, we need salvation.  Christians are those who have accepted God's free gift of salvation, others (and Christians before they accepted) are not.  It's certainly not about organized, denominational religion; Christ's highest condemnation was reserved for those who were the hypocrites in the theocracy.

Unlike teachings by the Catholics, that you must perform works to retain your salvation, the Bible teaches the exact opposite - works-based salvation is anathema.  After all, the thief on the cross next to Christ's merely expressed belief in him, and our saviour responded "I will see you today in Paradise".  There were no works the thief could perform hanging there, hours from death.  No last rights.  No trip to Purgatory (a completely invented issue, not scriptural at all).  Yet he was assured of salvation and Heaven merely by accepting the gift.

I think your point was missed though. Or wrong. (?) Personally I think that every religion (at least as far as the major religion structures go) is based on belief, which you cannot and are not supposed to get from someone else. The churches may say differently, but in all of the texts that they claim to build their foundations on, it says different - even in the translations. The Koran, the Bible, Confucious, Judaism, Hindu's, you name it. You must discover it for yourself if it is to mean anything, and in that meaning you discover your purpose (or at least what you come to believe is your purpose). 
<BR>
I think your pretty close on how religion came about in the first place, but I also think there are ways of looking at things from a religious (read higher power) point of view that offers unique insights that you won't get from traditional science (as scientific evidence, I point your attention to the medical field which gets closer to endorsing traditional medicines every day. Unless of course your a drug company...). 
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, I have a fear that people will think I'm a bible thumper. I'm really not. I just think people should really investigate what they believe rather than obsess over things they don't believe (I.E. your religion is wrong, all religion is wrong, my religion is wrong, etc.). 
<BR>

<BR>
My slightly off kilter mother in law (read not crazy enough to commit ;) studies religion, and picked one that leaves room for aliens. And being interested in the cosmos (like I said...) she told me a story she read about an abductee who had a conversation with said aliens. They find it odd that more people don't believe in God, because they claim the inspiration from said being is how they achieved their technological advances. I'll admit, she's a little wacked, but the Pope would have a hard time keeping up with her knowledge of religion - and that's no joke. She's smart. And still isn't sure she's got it right.
