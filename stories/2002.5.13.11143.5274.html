		It's springtime, and once again we have a bombastic space opera from <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial2/lucas/">George 
  Lucas</a> to fritter away our hard-earned money on. Last year's offering from 
  <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/TXAMAcadillac.html">Skywalker 
  Ranch</a> had many diehard fans leaving the theater a bit disappointed, so while 
  the hype may be a bit less than it was in 2001, the underlying tension is much 
  greater. Among those who place value judgments on this sort of thing, the second 
  of the first trilogy is considered the best of the three. Will Attack of the 
  Clones be the same? Is the magic numeral II installment the one that will be 
  full of depth, subtlety, and complex character development? 
<P>
Probably not, but we're going to take you through the movie anyway. Grab a bucket of popcorn and prepare yourself for the <a href="/">Adequacy</a> movie review of <B>Star Wars: Episode II - The Attack of the Clones</B>.
<P>
<I>Note: We at <a href="/">Adequacy</a> have made every effort to ensure that our review won't ruin your intended movie-going experience through the inadvertent revelation of any &quot;spoilers&quot;.</I>        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">So the movie starts off with the requisite main score while the oddly skewed 
  yellow text brings us up to speed on the goings-on in the galaxy. Something 
  about unrest in the Senate, a separatist movement led by a &quot;Count Dookie&quot;, 
  <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> being a Senator herself, 
  yada yada yada. The main message is that the forced-perspective text looked 
  lame as fuck in 1977, and seems downright abysmal 25 years later. One would 
  think that with all the billions Lucas has made on the previous films he could 
  afford a decent title sequence. 
<P> True to a movie made for kids and dysfunctional adults, we then jump right 
  into the action. Senator <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> 
  is getting off her liqui-chrome spaceship on Coruscant when... <B>kaboom!</B> 
  ...she blows up. Omigod, is she dead?!? Of course not, it was her stand in (you 
  remember her from Episode I, right?). This scene provides a great opportunity 
  for <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Natalie Portman</a> to get all weepy 
  over her dead assistant and show us that <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> 
  even cares for the little people. What an angel. 
<P> After that we see Yoda, Samuel &quot;Mace Windu&quot; Jackson and some freaky 
  looking alien Jedi talking to Darth Sidious. Er, um, I mean Supreme Chancellor 
  Palpatine, who of course is in <I>no way</I> connected to Mr. Sidious. I mean, 
  he's obviously a good guy, right? Yeah, sure. If you paid <I>any</I> attention 
  to Episodes IV-VI you already know who he is. Also, those subtle facial expressions 
  and tones of voice suggesting devious intentions sure do lend an air of, shall 
  we say, insidiousness, to him. 
<P> So do the Master Jedi Knights pick up on Palpatine's two-faced treachery? 
  No. The eight year-old kids at the theater see it plain as day, but to the leaders 
  of the Jedi Council, people who have undergone the most stringent of training 
  for detecting such duplicity, people who have freakin' powers of <I>mind control</I> 
  and are <I>sitting right across the desk from this guy</I>, to them Palpatine 
  seems A-OK. 
<P> Anyway, the whole point of this scene is to set up Obi-Wan &quot;Ewen McGregor 
  looks goofy in a beard&quot; Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a>'s 
  bodyguards since it seems like somebody is trying to kill her. Of course it 
  is Palpatine who suggests this. My goodness, what sort of deviltry is he up 
  to? We also briefly see Jar-Jar Binks stroll by in the background. No lines 
  for him in this scene, though. 
<P> Prior to <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> getting hooked 
  up with her Jedi, we get to meet the two of them alone in an elevator. Anakin 
  is now a moody teen and his pining for <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com/">Natalie 
  Portman</a>'s firm buttox is quite apparent. When the elevator door opens they 
  are greeted by Jar-Jar and... he speaks! Nothing like a little racist, neo-Jamaican 
  patois to tickle the funny bone. 
<P> Once the whole gang is reunited all the complex character development gets 
  dumped, wholesale, in about 45 seconds of screen time. Obi-Wan is the wise yet 
  caring teacher, Anakin is straining under the throes of pubescent hormonal lust 
  and good old rebellion, while <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> 
  is distant yet maternal in her care for Anakin. Jar-Jar appears to be little 
  more than house nigger. 
<P> The next scenes begin to suggest why Lucas chose <I>Attack of the Clones</I> 
  as title for this movie. All of the visual imagery was stolen from other people's 
  films. The super-dense high rise cityscape, complete with moody nighttime lighting 
  through half-open blinds, is equal parts <I>Blade Runner</I> and <I>The Fifth 
  Elephant</I> to such an obvious degree that it is painful. We get to zoom about 
  this impossibly crowded aerial metropolis at high speeds in a futuristic flying 
  car chase. It's all Luc Besson at this point, including people falling from 
  building to vehicle. You could swap Hayden Christensen (Anakin) with Bruce Willis 
  at any point and the transition would be seamless (admittedly, replacing McGregor 
  with Milla Jovovich might be noticed). 
<P>
During this chase Anakin and Obi-Wan banter amusingly and offer flip one-liners. It almost works, but not quite. After the necessary crash to end the pursuit we swing fully into Ridley Scott's corner with teeming ground-level streets and a seedy bar full of oddly dressed people. 
<P>
There's some sort of plot development going on through all this, but it's not very important. What is important is that this movie tries very hard to drop little nuggets of joy for the aging Star Wars fan base. The first one occurs outside the aforementioned bar when a bounty hunter who looks an awful lot like the Boba Fett of Episodes IV-VI kills somebody and then zooms off with his nifty jet pack. It is at this point where the first real signs of plot strain begin to show.
<P>
Now for some reason Obi-Wan is going to a mysteriously undocumented planet to investigate whatever the hell it is that we're supposed to care about, while Anakin stays behind to give the screenwriter a convenient opportunity to have <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> reciprocate Anakin's puppy love.
<P> The mystery planet is actually a sterile looking clone factory run by tall, 
  lizard necked folks. Hard to say which movie set is being cloned, since the 
  sterile, white, space-based science facility has been done so many times before. 
  It's probably safe to credit Kubrick with being the biggest victim of theft 
  here. All the clones themselves look vaguely ethnic. Additionally, they are 
  apparently the precursor to Stormtroopers. Basically, at the factory they quickly 
  breed a bunch of brown-skinned people who are literally identical looking, dress 
  them up in white armor, and now they represent a huge, sinister force. What 
  exactly is George Lucas trying to say here? 
<P>
The lizard-necked scientists are a bit daft and don't realize they are revealing details to the wrong person when they tell Obi-Wan that the clones were ordered 10 years ago by a supposedly long-dead Jedi. They are also oblivious to the error of revealing the presence of a bounty hunter and his cloned &quot;son&quot;, named Jango and Boba Fett, respectively, at the station. People in technical professions like genetics and computer science are often socially and politically clueless that way, resulting in atrocities like nuclear weapons and peer-to-peer file sharing.
<P> Jango and Obi-Wan have a tense little meeting where more plot details of some 
  sort are revealed, including the fact that all the clones look just like Jango 
  himself, and then they get into a fight. Neither one of them dies though, so 
  they chase after each other in space ships instead. 
<P> Back in the world of sappy love stories, things are progressing quite slowly. 
  Anakin is still behaving like the sort of teen you'd send to military school 
  as punishment. This brings to mind another apparent failing of Jedi University. 
  If they're so great at molding super-competent Jedi, how come they can't raise 
  a teenager who isn't a whiny little brat? 
<P>
<a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> stays cold and distant to the advances of &quot;Ani&quot;, and it's hard to see how they're going to end up getting busy and squirting out two kids. Then, they kiss. Yes, that abruptly. First she couldn't care less, then she's probing for tonsils. Whatever caused her change of heart apparently got left on the editing room floor.
<P>
George Lucas seems to be awfully fond of himself, so eventually he starts cloning his own movies. First Anakin has a dream about his mother being in pain, so he disobeys his orders and goes off to help her (Luke, 1:2). <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> tags along.
<P> Of course helping Mom means dropping another joy nugget for the fans, so it's 
  back to Tatooine yet again. We reminisce with Watto a bit, and then head out 
  to an awfully familiar looking house. Yup, it's the same one where future whiny 
  little Jedi wannabe Luke grows up, and we get to meet the aunt and uncle who 
  will be so trivial in later movies. The plot strains become more noticeable.
<P>
But hey, what's the point of time spent on Tatooine of you don't get to see some Tusken Raiders? Seems they've kidnapped Anakin's mother, Shmi, so we get to bust a hang with a whole bunch of them. Hell, even the Jawas pop up for a cameo. Nothing like rehashing old ground when you can't come up with a decent plot device.
<P> Oh yeah, Anakin's Mom dies in his arms just as he rescues her (how convenient), 
  and then he goes bezerk and slaughters all the Tusken Raiders. Apparently this 
  is bad. Even Yoda gets some negative Force vibes from it, and he's way on the 
  other side of the galaxy. 
<P> Meanwhile, Obi-Wan's story line isn't doing much better. Lacking anything 
  more exciting to do in a space chase, they fly into an asteroid field. They 
  even venture into an asteroid <I>tunnel</I>. To be fair though, the absolute 
  coolest part of the whole movie happens in this scene. See, Jango Fett has these 
  bomb thingies, and he's hurling them at Obi-Wan's ship. Whenever one of them 
  hits an asteroid and detonates everything goes dead silent for a half second 
  and then a wonderfully flanged and modulated <B>kwaaang!</B> rings out while 
  a pale blue shock wave radiates through space. Hearing that sound is almost 
  worth the price of admission. 
<P> Somehow Obi-Wan ends up on a droid factory planet pursuing Jango and Boba 
  and he gets caught by the dread Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus/Saruman the White/Christopher 
  Lee. Count Doofus tells him about some plot involving the Senate and the separatists 
  that is entirely too confusing for this sort of movie. In short, he asks Obi-Wan 
  to join him, and Obi essentially tells him to go fuck himself. Count Doodu responds 
  to the snubbing by amassing a huge army of orcs, er, droids, and leaving Obi-Wan 
  trapped in a tower until he is rescued by a giant owl. 
<P> Over on Tatooine, <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> is revealing 
  herself to be quite the mischievous little minx, and she talks Anakin into going 
  to save Obi-Wan. They arrive at the factory and proceed to battle their way 
  through the exact same sorts of choppy, bashing mechanical bits that so flummoxed 
  Sigourney Weaver in <I>Galaxy Quest</I>. R2-D2 has no problems with them though 
  because he has jet packs. I don't recall him having jet packs before. I imagine 
  they would have been very useful if he had managed to hang onto them for his 
  later adventures. 
<P> I wish I could say C3PO did as well as R2, but his head gets lopped off and 
  installed on one of those battle droids, while a battle droid's head gets stuck 
  onto 3PO's ungainly frame. I don't want to ruin the movie, but I must tell you 
  that much hilarity ensues from this manufacturing gaffe. But this movie isn't 
  about droids, it's about clones, so let's get back to those. 
<P> The next clone returns us to Ridley Scott territory. Anakin and <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Amidala</a> 
  get captured, and are joined with Obi-Wan in a gladiator arena (yes, a gladiator 
  arena) where they are forced to fight animals and robots to the death. It is 
  at this point where <a href="http://www.natalieportman.com">Natalie Portman</a>'s 
  midriff begins to receive significant screen time. 
<P> Things go well at first, then our protagonists get into trouble as the robots 
  multiply. All seems lost until Samuel Jackson's bald head strides in, accompanied 
  by a whole bunch of other Jedi. Jedi and robot go at it in great numbers and 
  there's lots of glowing phalluses being wielded about and much carnage. Jango 
  Fett flies on into the fray only to get beheaded by Mace Windu. His young clone 
  Boba seems to find this upsetting, and presumably he'll be holding a grudge 
  for some time over this. 
<P> Things go well (again) until our protagonists get into trouble (again) as 
  the robots multiply (again). The next turn in the battle occurs when Yoda comes 
  strafing into the arena with several ships loaded with clones and utters his 
  most absurdly spoken line ever: "Around the survivors a perimeter create!" It 
  made me want to beat Frank Oz to death with a copy of <I>Labyrinth</I>. 
<P>
As the arena battle winds down and everybody leaves to chase the fleeing Count Dooker we see Boba Fett cradling his progenitor's severed head. Somebody should get the kid some counseling or he's going to have some real issues later on.
<P>
After a rolling battle across the plains of... whatever planet they're on ...Doochu gets cornered by Anakin and Obi-Wan. As anybody who's ever seen one of the other Star Wars movies can tell you, it's light saber time.
<P>
Anakin attacks. Anakin gets tossed in the corner like a sack of dirty laundry. Obi-wan attacks. Obi-Wan gets beaten down like a filthy Scottish actor. Anakin attacks again, this time in the dark and with <I>two</I> glowing phalluses! He looks a lot like one of those irritating Rave kids waving glowsticks about, but he must've forgotten to take his vitamin E because he gets his hand chopped right off. Yes, his hand. The right one. Just like his future son. Oh, the anachronistic irony! This is profound stuff.
<P>
Our protagonists are once again in trouble and all seems lost (again) until... ninja Yoda!
<P>
He comes hobbling in on his cane looking a bit feeble, but oh is he pissed. After a short hand gesturing bit of "My Schwartz if bigger than yours" they get down to the wand waving. But Yoda doesn't grab his saber. Nosirree, he telekenesifies it from his belt to his wrinkled green paw. Yoda is one bad mother fucker.
<P> He flips, he spins, he darts through the air like a mosquito on crack. If 
  you watch <I>Iron Monkey</I> on fast forward it still won't come close to the 
  acrobatics of this little gremlin. However, he doesn't win. He's forced to chose 
  between killing Count Doosey and saving the other two Jedi from a falling pillar, 
  and he lets the Count go. Despite his ninja skills, Yoda is a humanitarian at 
  the core. The next shot shows the Count flying away in a ship powered by some 
  sort of solar sail (the &quot;hard science&quot; geeks are going to love that 
  bit). 
<P> As the movie draws to a close we see Anakin flexing his new prosthetic hand, 
  just like Luke does in Episode V. It might be chilling if it weren't so contrived. 
  When a screenwriter/director has a decade and a half to come up with a prequel 
  you would expect him to conclude with something a little less obvious. But, 
  that's what you get when you focus on joy nuggets of nostalgia for a pathetic 
  group of emotionally underdeveloped adults. 
<P>
We hope you have enjoyed this <a href="/">Adequacy</a>

While no one would dispute that they are very dangerous, like any tool, they are not evil in themselves, but can be used for evil or good.
<BR><BR>
Fortunately for the world, they were developed and used by one of the most moral nations in the history of the world, America. They saved countless millions of lives when used in Japan. By preventing the need for an invasion, hundreds of thousands God-fearing American casualties were avoided, as well as millions of the Japanese Pagans.
<BR><BR>
After the war America used nuclear weapons to secure Europe against the Red Menace. While we could have destroyed our economy by attempting to match the Warsaw Pact tank for tank, we instead let the Russians know that any invasion of Western Europe would be met by tactical nukes in the Fulda Gap, and probably strategic nukes on thier Commie motherland. Thus, by balancing an overwhelming force of vodka swilling heathen mongols with a handful of nukes, we were able to focus America's economy on comsumer goods, making the American dream of a house and two cars within reach of all but the most incompetent Americans, is it any wonder that freedom hungry foreigners from Mexico, China and England will risk their lives to reach our fecund shores?

Sadly, it seems to be somewhat wasted with respect to Europe. What the decadent Soviets could not conquer militarily they conquered socially, an Anti-God, drug-abusing, sexually libertine ethos seems to be sweeping western Europe, with the only real God Fearing sorts left being Muslim immigrants from Algeria and Turkey.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
The Nagasaki bomb wasn't really necessary. But Fat Man was of a different construction than Little Boy, and Pentagon apparently wanted to see it in action. Apparently, "enemy" ground is the best weapon testing site. Structures, vehicles, people... every kind of a target any general could wish for, for no cost for "us".
<BR><BR>
It seems that to be taken seriously in international negotiations you need to have some of the nuclear beauties on your command. A couple of sleek, slender missiles, and your word has the required weight. Judging from the recend European Union demands, it seems that returning the nukes deployed here back to Russians was a Big[TM] Mistake[TM].
<BR><BR>
Maybe I should take things to my own hands. The only thing I miss for a crude fission bomb is the weapon-grade uranium; all the other systems for a gun assembly device are well within the reach of my budget and the technology I have access to. I am not so sure with the implosion assembly, especially the required explosive lenses. If it would be worth of the effort, though, I'd ponder to try to build the high-speed firing circuits. It's nothing magical after all, the minimal required technology is almost 60 years old. What I'd miss is the carrier, though - I don't yet have access to the technology for more than puny few kg of payload.
<BR><BR>
Pondering. Maybe the lenses could be primed not by exploding wire but by exploding metal foil, which can be made to microexplode by a hit of intense laser beam. The required pulse can be generated by commercially available Nd:YAG laser, and led to the "primes" by a fiber. In this case, be led to all the primes at once by several fibers from one laser. Similar technology is in some cases used for secure priming of explosives in quarries and mines. This takes away the problems with embargoed low-induction capacitors and sprytrons.
<BR><BR>
Maybe it is time to put my country to the list of nuclear powers.

You've just moved the triggering problem.
<BR><BR>
If you choose to use the usual keepalive type kryton instead of a vacuum kryton, you risk accidental triggering unless the firing circuitry is sufficiently shielded or distanced from the fissible material.  This could be done, of course, but it would be quite risky to develop, and such a design would make the device almost useless as a weapon.

So I can use any triggering solution with fast-enough switch time, and I am not dependent on constant and accurate latency anyway. I also don't need to switch high currents as well, as ie. Kerr cell doesn't take by far so much of current as exploding wire fuzes. So I simplified the triggering problem but don't eliminate the triggering problem entirely. Further simplifying could be achieved if we'd manage to shape the laser pulse in some way - make its leading edge sharper - after the laser is fired, which could lower the switch time requirements and allow us to use more common technology, ie. a spark gap.
<BR><BR>
Sprytrons I mentioned are other name for vacuum krytrons. I am aware about the accidental triggering problem.

The designs that are within the range of my resources are mostly unusable as a "real" weapon, as they would need a middle-sized truck (or a cargo plane) as a delivery method. Making a nuke that is small and lightweight enough to be delivered by a missile is a problem much more resource-hungry than just making a nuke. :(

If you still find this amusing, by all means, keep it up.  Go find some "laser pulse shaping" sites, skim them, and come back when you've got a bundle of nifty jargon and a semi-plausible explanation that most people will find too boring to check out, or even think about.  In ever more broken English, please.
<BR><BR>
Once your new laser shaping contraption idea is available for study, maybe someone can determine whether it would be easier to use the thing (along with the next system it will lead to, and the next...) or to simply "shape" the laser pulse by using a faster switch.

I considered redeveloping the sprytron. It would actually be a nice way of revenge to the USA for effectively killing Tamara, our passive radar system, through political lobbying. (Part of the operation was accusing of the company owner from unlawful deals, suspending his licence for selling military material, and then finding out everything is all right, after the company (HTT Tesla Pardubice) got effectively bankrupt. One of the shipments from before, I don't know if it was Tamara or its predecessor Ramona, was intercepted couple years before in some port and then shipped to USA. (A friend's relative was in the management there so I heard stories. Small country, so everyone knows everyone.) Surprise surprise, Lockheed is now developing passive radar technology.) It shouldn't be too difficult, as it is just another kind of a switching tube. But the man I knew who used to design tubes in 60's died before we managed to start the project. :( I could even get to see a krytron, I think a friend has keys from the laser lab it is in.

Regarding export laws, dad was involved in smuggling a Siemens computer, back when it was embargoed. (Two, more accurately. One as spare parts, as each one of them was under the COCOM limits, the other one through an Austrian man-in-the-middle, who "downgraded" the machine by misdeclaring it as a weaker under-the-limits model, and reexported it here.) Working without licences as well - I got taught as a kid that what matters is the work quality, not the papers. I like my bloodline.

If you consider the United States to be as corrupt as a regime that is guilty of incredible human rights abuses, your perspective is probably warped enough to consider arms dealing a moral obligation. In light of that observation, I should point out that the Vietnamese government is in possession of billions of dollars worth of US military equipment that they can't use and can't move on the open market. They need a patsy with no morals to try to move it secretly, and at incredible risk. I think you could be that patsy. You may commence telling me why you would be justified in illegal arms sales now.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Counterquestion, when you started about Viet Nam: How should I judge the acts of first starting a war based on half-faked event in Tonkin Gulf (see Pentagon Papers), and then ending with evacuating of Americans only and leaving their local supporters there without help(see the infamous and hasty retreat), to an easy-to-predict fate?

Though I'd quite like to get my hands on some less common toys. A military-grade thermal imaging system could be nice. Next few years will show what I will be able to get; a lot of technology is migrating into commercial sector...
<BR><BR>
It's more fun to design weapons from commercially available off-the-shelf devices. Next to everything can be dual-use. And knowing the countermeasures - ie, a rag soaked in vinegar is a good protection against police tear gas (CS, aka chlorbenzylidenmalondinitrile). Color foils, the kind that lighting technicians are using, could be useful as low-cost countermeasures against laser dazzlers, the nonlethal weapons soon to be deployed as one kind of the riot control arsenal (the types I am familiar with are based on powerful semiconductor lasers in red band - their power is limited in order to not cause blindness when hitting naked eye, so the amount of energy the filter will have to cope with isn't so big). And so on...

But seriously.
<BR><BR>
Vinegar is useful for soaking rags used as face-masks, to breath through (or, when in a container, to throw a burning CS grenade into, as advised by IRA for the standoff situations). Raw cut onions are advised by PLO to scrub the chemicals from affected skin (sniffing the onions reportedly helps as well, probably to wash away the CS from eyes by invoked tears).
<BR><BR>
When I was checking the validity of this info (the last time I was studying this for demonstrations was year and half ago, and I admit I hadn't knew about the onions (thanks)), most of the links mentioning vinegar were related to anti-globalization demonstrations, while most of links mentioning onions were related to riots taking place in the Middle East.
<BR><BR>
In short, both are useful - vinegar before you get hit, onions after.

I'd advise against Toshiba implants. This technology isn't common enough to hit the streets yet. Besides, 2.1Mpx is far from what I would consider high-density for eyes (though for this particular application nonhomogenous distribution of sensors across the "retina" could be very beneficial to offer better apparent resolution with fewer pixels). For protection against chemical warfare agents, a gas mask is optimal cost/effect/reliability solution for facial protection.
<BR><BR>
I have a little bit of advantage here, as my elementary school training still contained the civil defense lectures, or what to do if the Evil Imperialists would attack with yperit. This was later abandoned as a relict of communist ideology, instead of being meaningfully reformed to deal with similar threats, like industrial mishaps. The defense is the same if ie. chlorine is released as a chemical attack as if it leaks because of water treatment plant accident.

So, I saw Episode II today. And I have to say, I disagree with this review. I will admit, it was a bit forced, but all of the "repeat plot devices" you describe are meant to be foreshadowing. Just because you didn't get that, doesn't mean the movie sucked. I've sen much worse movies with much worse plot development than this one. It was a good story, and considerably different from all the other Star wars movies, even with the "joy nuggets."

And it could be argued that since George Lucas was around and making movies at the same time as or before the directors and writers you say he rips off, there is a question of who ripped who off.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Also, the transitions were too many and horridly done, cutting in the midle of one scene of Obi Wan to "Ani" and back again.  They reminded me of the Austin Powers transitions without the dancing Austin Powers (I'm not ripping on Powers here as its transitions were intentionally done as such).  All they needed to make the transitions complete is some big animated tie fighter pulling the screen across for the next scene with a big whoosh sound each time and the movie would be complete in its patheticness.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
