		One of the hottest and most volatile topics in public education today is the theory of biological evolution, and a constant debate is raging about whether or not it ought to be taught in American classrooms.  On one side of the debate you'll find professional biologists who point to a mountain of scientific evidence in favor of evolutionary common descent.  On the other side you'll find religious fundamentalists who point to time-honored Scriptures and holes in biology's current understanding of evolution.  In between, you'll find lots of moderate folks who find no conflict at all between religious tradition and modern science, but they are not nearly controversial enough for <A HREF="../index.html">Adequacy.org</A>.<P>

I have weighed all of the evidence, examined all of the arguments, and pored over all of the statistics.  All of this leads me to believe that there can be only one acceptable solution to this controversy: We need creationism in our schools.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Now, before I get any further, allow me to make a couple of observations.<p>

<ul>
<li>I am aware that the theory of biological evolution, and the twin-nested hierarchy of evolutionary common descent that is a logical result of said theory, is probably 100% true.
<li>I am also aware that the Biblical creation story is basically bullshit.
<li>Nevertheless, I maintain that schools need to teach <A HREF="http://www.creationism.org/">Biblical Creationism</A>.</ul>At this point, you may be asking yourself, "What in the <A HREF="http://www.cleveland.com/">hell</A> is George talking about?"  After all, the idea that we should teach our children something which we know to be incorrect is very <a href="../index.html">controversial</a>.  I am aware of this.  However, my <A HREF="http://www.the-rolling-stones.com/">six decades</A> on this rock that we call Earth have also taught me another important lesson: Sometimes the end justifies the means.  You may contend that the classroom is no place to conduct a Machiavellian experiment of this kind, but I would counter by saying that the <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/news/2001/n020101c.html">newspaper headlines</A> prove you wrong.<p>

Allow me to expand on this a little bit.  Think back to when you were a child.  When <A HREF="http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/jokes/92q1/whbruch.html">Christmas</A> rolled around, how many of you honestly believed that a <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/">fat man</a> in a <A HREF="http://www.ydr.com/mike/5argn1011224.shtml">red suit</A> would squeeze his <A HREF="./2001.7.11.115427.368.html">ass</A> down your chimney and shower you with gifts .. provided that you had behaved well over the course of the previous year?  Come on, let's see a show of hands.  Is your hand up?  Mine is.  And how many of you made a conscious effort to behave well in an attempt to maximize your gift-receiving potential?  Again, I find that my hand is up.  Do you see where I'm going with this?<p>

Sometimes truth can be irrelevant when the final result is a desired set of behaviors.  Sure, we all now know that there is no such thing as <A HREF="http://webpages.marshall.edu/~hartwel1/humor/MISC/SANTA_CLAUS_TIMELINE.html">Santa Claus</A>, but didn't this belief help keep us on the <A HREF="http://www.exodusnorthamerica.org/">"straight and narrow"</A> during those formative years when we were most susceptible to misbehavior and general naughtiness?  I would submit that the answer to this question is a resounding "yes", and I believe that we can formulate a more general principle from this: <i>There is nothing wrong with <A HREF="http://www.cheapeasterbunnysuits.com/">lying to children</A> so long as it keeps them docile.</i>  There can be little doubt that biological evolution is true, but the fact of the matter remains that most junior high and high school-aged children are <A HREF="http://www.howardstern.com/">ill-equipped</A> to deal with its ramifications.<p>

Fine.  The solution is obvious.<p>

Teach them <A HREF="http://www.icr.org">creationism</A>.<p>

Now, I am fully aware of the standard criticisms to this idea.  Yes, I concede that it probably violates the First Amendment.  Yes, it probably tramples on the rights of non-Christian children.  And yes, there's that whole issue about none of it being true.  However, I am a "results-oriented" person, and I am willing to dismiss these problems as long as we can clean up some of the behavior in our schools.  Our children are <A HREF="http://www.thisistrue.com/zt.html">shooting</A> and <A HREF="http://www.banscrewdrivers.com/">screwing</A> each other at unprecedented levels, and if a belief in a 6,000 year-old Universe and a vengeful Creator can help turn these statistics around, then I'm all for it.  Evolution was not taught in classrooms in the year 1800, and I can guarantee you that there were no violent incidents involving mass-shootings or body piercings or Marilyn Manson.  Who <I>cares</I> if it's wrong?  We can still teach it, can't we?<p>

There is, I think, a scientific precedent to this as well.  Almost all high school physics students are required to learn <A HREF="http://www.recipesource.com/desserts/cookies/bars/fig-newton1.html">Newton's</A> three "laws" of gravitation.  These "laws" are presented as <A HREF="http://bible.gospelcom.net">Absolute Truth</A>, and many former students can still recite them from memory.  However, we have known since the beginning of the <A HREF="http://www.fox.com">20th Century</A> that these "laws" are nothing of the kind; Einstein's theory of general relativity is not at all compatible with Newton's "laws", and relativity has been experimentally demonstrated to be correct on numerous occasions.  Newton's "laws" break down at <A HREF="http://www.tvland.com/shows/aitf/actor3.jhtml">large-scale</A> levels (for instance, Newtonian mechanics cannot be used to accurately describe the orbit of the planet <A HREF="http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/EinsteinTest.html">Mercury</A>.)  Relativity, on <A HREF="http://www.leftiesonlygolf.com/">the other hand</A>, is consistent and measurably correct on virtually all levels, with the possible exception of situations involving extreme mass and energy where quantum effects can no longer be ignored.<p>

Newton's <A HREF="http://www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/defender.html">defenders</A> say "well, okay .. perhaps Newtonian mechanics is not universally correct, but it works very well for situations here on Earth, and in that context it is very accurate."  That is all well and good, but the fact remains that Newton was wrong, but <i>physics instructors teach his "laws" anyway.</i>  And they are 100% justified in doing so.  There is no way in hell that we should expect high school students to be able to understand the ramifications of general relativity.  It's <A HREF="http://www.paulyshore.com">weird</A>, <A HREF="http://www.redgreen.com/">wacky</A>, and difficult stuff.  Why can't we do the same thing with creationism?  Why should we expect these impressionable children to be able to deal with the cold reality that is biological evolution?<p>

So does this mean that we shouldn't teach evolution at all?  Of course not; evolution should be part of the standard curriculum at every <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/jolietjake/college.html">college</A> in this nation.  But my point is that by the time that children go off to college, they are (by and large) mentally ready to handle the theory.  They are 18 years old, they are living on their own, and for the first time in their lives, they find themselves in a position of real responsibility.  They learn that the world is a bit different than their sheltered illusions have led them to believe, and they grow up quickly.  Then (and only then) are they prepared to accept the reality .. so let's <I>wait</I> until then to give it to them.<P>

Of course, you might point out that not all children end up going to college.  This is true, but of what use is biology to people who pump <A HREF="http://www.fartmart.com">gas</A> or dig ditches?  These people are inherently ill-prepared to deal with the truth, and they have about as much use for biological evolution as a cat has for pajamas.  Here again, society benefits from allowing these folks to have their delusions.  When my wife and I go to eat at our favorite restaurant, it makes little difference to me if the guy who parks my car thinks that the Universe is 6,000 years old.  So long as my car doesn't get any scratches, I'm not bothered.<p>

As far as the rest of our children are concerned, evolution can wait.  Let's hold the theory back until they're ready for it, and in the meantime let's teach them whatever it takes to keep them from killing each other.  More now than at any time in our history, we need creationism in our schools.  You can disagree with me, but only if you are a <A HREF="http://www.kuro5hin.org/user/trhurler">certified lunatic</A> that ignores the nightly news.  There are times that we have to recognize that the truth is not the most important virtue, and I would submit to you that we are living in one of those times.      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This was definately not what I expected, but it makes perfect sense.  I also believe that pure creationism is pure crap, regardless of whether or not evolution is valid.  Perhaps there was a creator, who created the laws of the universe and let things run from there.  (The Genesis myth simply being a dumbed down version of what really happened.  After all, people did not have much of a grasp on universal mechanics back then...)<br><br>
However, I've always admired the ideals and morals behind most religions, even while hating to the core any form of <i>organized</i> religion.  I don't exactly feel that we should perpetuate this type of religion, but perhaps a compromie would truley be the best thing for our children.  Present the idea of religion and faith as something not fully understood.  i.e., we know that there is a God of some kind, and that we will be rewarded/punished in some way for our actions while alive.  It keeps them under control, without forcing them into any particular doctrine until they are old enough to make a choice for themselves.  Upon attending college and learning the truth, they will have the choice to stick with their religion, abandon it entirely, or look for some kind of compromise, usually through agnosticism.<br><br>

<BR><BR>As you correctly point out, the evidence for evolution is overwhelming. But while a few believers eventually manage to reconcile their faith in God with their knowledge of Science, the doctrine of evolution has proven to be one of the most fertile grounds for planting the seeds of Atheism in childrens' hearts. And one need only glance at the historical record of Soviet Russia or Maoist China or Pol Pot's Cambodia to realize the peril of an atheist society. From all historical evidence, the cold, inhuman worldview of atheism leads unbelievers to substitude murderous ideologies such as Communism for religious worship. Millions of murdered souls attest that this is no trivial danger.

<BR><BR>While my ideal solution is similar to yours, you fatally overestimate the maturity of the average 18-year-old college freshman, often an <a href="http://www.vix.com/objectivism/Writing/NathanielBranden/BenefitsAndHazards.html">Ayn Rand acolyte</a> or even a radical socialist. Exposed to evolutionary teachings, many of these children will question the existence of God--an act in conflict with the need for a civil society.

<BR><BR>Plato noted the utility of myths, such as religion, in shaping society; the laborers and soldiers could be led to correct behavior through the force of religion, while the elite Philosopher-Kings could construct the myths and protect the masses from harmful realities through judicious censorship. 

<BR><BR>Creationism is one such myth--a myth that can save the proletariat from violent revolution thorugh the powerfully human force of religion.
Consequently, evolution must be completely replaced by Creationism in high school curricula. At the collegiate level, only those students showing sufficiently high aptitude to become the new wardens of society (for example, those attending top 10 universities) need be instructed in the reality of evolution; other may be taught the truth when necessary to provide a sufficient workforce for the biotechnology industry and related fields. To extend the teaching of evolutionary truth further would endanger the future of our society to the forces of Godless atheism.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I have to sake your hand on this one. That type of comment gives authors like Ayn Rand fodder for their works. Any society that works by denying things to the public 'for their own good' usually backfires. Denying information and liberties is an insult, and once you get a proletariat that sees through it, it will crumble. And it WILL happen.<br><br>

Human civilizations resist against any force that attempts to make it static. The only way to move forward is to make changes: to ideas, beliefs, theories, notions, social attitudes/etc. If we continue to push old notions that some just won't accept, we endanger the REPUTATION of that notion, and even fewer people will follow it.<br><br>

Sure we need a way to 'keep people in line', but we shouldn't be doing it in a totalitarian manner such as this. There are ways to help behavior and politeness without forcing some other person's morals on the child that the child's parents don't agree with.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Logic works when you have assertions based on commonly accepted notions leading to uncontestable conclusion.

These conclusions are based on the personal vision of tkatchev, the definition of liberalism is tkatchev's definition. For most people here a liberalist is someone who doesn't agree with tkatchev. It may make me a moron, but I don't understand it, and I know I am in very good company. Among those who seem to understand, there is contestation. We don't know what is that liberalism, we don't know the religion of liberalism. The second conclusion is a pure assertion, and a very contestable one (science has no article of faith, unless it is proven without holes, and it is not the case with Evolution: that's why it's a theory).<BR><BR>Let's have some fun with logic:<br>1 - Evolutionism is a scientific theory.<br>2 - They teach Evolutionism in public schools.<br>3 - They teach one or more scientific theories in public schools.<br><br>1b - Creationism is a religious article of faith.<br>2b - They teach Creationism in church.<br>3b - They teach one or more religious article of faith in church.<br><br>They should teach Creationism in public schools<br><br>Hence Creationism must be a scientific theory, or public schools are churches.<BR><BR>Damnit, must go to work.

The idea of a vengeful God is clearly a Judaic view, and this has been corrected by the Church during Vatican II.  God is a loving being, in fact, I will posit that God <i>is</i> Love itself.  Lest I appear to be an apologist, I will affirm my belief in the doctrine set forth in the Dominus Iesus; Christianity is the one true religion, the the Roman Catholic Church is the one true church within that religion.  Feeding children incongruous ideas from false religions (including Protestantism) will only lead to a path of no salvation.
<BR><BR>
To clarify my last statement, my proposal is not just an answer for the afterlife but for the earthly life.  Children given a Catholic education are well-prepared for the world.  Take a quick look at the Catechism, and you can see that it offers discourse not just on matters of faith, but on economics, political science (para. 2234-2257), even mass media.  It's an all-encompassing guide to life.
<BR><BR>
Instituting this policy is certainly more problematic than the one you propose.  Separation of religion and state will be hollered.  However, this may soon be alleviated depending on how the Supreme Court votes on the issue currently before them regarding school vouchers.  We may not be able to guide those left behind in public schools, but we can certainly provide the best education to those who decide to go to private schools.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Let's face it pal, Constantine brought Christianity as a religion of &gt;WAR&lt; to the Roman Empire.  It seems just plain ludicrous for me to be expected to believe that this institution which has been one of the world's great causes of war, death, and oppression is now the religion of love?

Basically, it's a good mathematical construct, but unfortunately it has nothing to do with real-world speciation.

"Evolution", the way scientifically-illiterate laymen understand it is nothing but another pointless tenet of the liberalist faith.

<BR>

<BR>
There are only two major theories, both diametrically opposed, that attempt to explain the cosmos as we know it today:
<BR>

<BR>
1) The theory of creation
<BR>
2) The theory of evolution
<BR>

<BR>
Both bring certain assumptions to table (which I won't list here).
<BR>

<BR>
The theory of evolution has many variants in certain areas, for example common descent or multiple descent, however the theory of creation is generally the same -- a common difference in opinion being old earth vs new earth.
<BR>

<BR>
From the evolutionist perspective, there are &gt;15 theories (from memory) on how the cosmos originated, none of which fit the data we have today. The most popular one still seems to be the big bang theory.
<BR>

<BR>
From the creationist perspective, the beginning of the cosmos is explained by an omnipotent, omniscient Creator.
<BR>

<BR>
So pray tell, given the above, if you believe in neither the theory of evolution or creation, then what do you believe?? And why exactly to you believe that 6 day creation story is idiotic (remembering that the 6 days may not be literal days but 6 periods of time)?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Correct. Maybe my original post was not clear enough. The beginning of the universe and what has occurred since then are two separate ideas. 
<BR>

<BR>
You may think that the evolution theory is "strictly a theory of where different species of animals come from" (and I tend to agree) but I can guarantee you that is not the common thought. A quick visit to the evolutionists trumpet site talkorigns.com site will tell you that.
<BR>

<BR>
And the fact is that 99% of evolutionists will prescribe to the big bang theory as their explanation of the origin of the universe and 99% of creationists believe that "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."
<BR>

<BR>
Note: I have talked to Christians that believe God created the universe and that evolution "took it from there", but this is a quite nonsensical position in my opinion.
<BR>

<BR>
Personally, I am as far removed from an evolutionist as you could imagine (see my reply to the AR) -- I am a new earth creationist. Maybe I was too objective in my original post for people to realise this.
<BR>

<BR>
So instead of sidestepping the issue this time, how about you tell me what you believe in and why you believe that the 6 day creation story is "idiotic"?

Though I agree (as a creationist) I hope you do not try to debate with evolutionists by calling them idiotic. Ever heard of respect when debating Mr Tkatchev?

"The literal interpretation of the six-day creation story is stupid because Genesis was quite obviously meant as a metaphor;"

Seriously man, do you get off on insults? Do you realise that insulting people/ideas shows your own insecurity?
<BR>

<BR>
Yes there are metaphors throughout Genesis but the entire book of Genesis?. The flood? The tower of Babel? The story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph all metaphors. Surely you don't believe that do you?
<BR>

<BR>
"a metaphor is the only way you can communicate complex subjects to illiterate goatherders;"
<BR>

<BR>
Agreed. God meets people where they are. That is why exegesis is so important.
<BR>

<BR>
"Besides, you cannot have a "day" as a unit of time measurement before you've created the earth, since a "day" is a unit fundamentally tied to our earth-side point of view."
<BR>

<BR>
Okay, fair enough. I tend to think the 6 day creation represents 6 periods of time though I am not entirely sure. 
<BR>

<BR>
For the second time, you still haven't pointed out where you stand though. Forget about evolution, initially you said the theory of creation is incorrect so I am interested as to what you *do* believe. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Define God as something that can do anything

Since God can do anything, Said God can create the universe RIGHT NOW with all of your memories and the 'natural science' everything already in it.

The fact that God (if you believe the christian faith) decided to do this in six days is irrelevant.

Of course it's impossible to prove that the entire Universe wasn't created in its present form three seconds ago.  That is <i>not</i> what the Christians claim.  If you were to go into the Deep South and claim that the Christian God instantaneously created the Universe in its present form, you would probably be lucky to escape with your life.  They make very specific claims about how and when things were created.  They do not suggest that some space god snapped its fingers and "poof", there everything is.  To them, such a suggestion is a damnable blasphemy.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Look, I never proposed evolution as a valid explanation of the cosmos I was merely pointing out common opinion among people who believe in evolution alright?
<BR>

<BR>
"Yeah, so? Does that make one them right? What is the basis for this conceit that presumes to know reality on the basis of ideas?" 
<BR>

<BR>
What's with the attitude my friend. Did I say one of them was unequivocally right? No. The fact is you cannot prove either idea scientifically (i.e. in the lab) which means you need a level of faith no matter what you believe.
<BR>

<BR>
Personally, based on the evidence I have come across, I believe in the theory of creation; that an infinitely powerful and loving God created the universe. I also believe that all life on this earth was created over a short period of time (6 days) and has deteriorated since. 
<BR>

<BR>
This fits my perception of how the universe works better than any other. Do you believe in anything or do you prefer to play the devil's advocate on all ideas?
<BR>
<BR>
"The ancient greeks had ideas, too. Here is the history of two ideas: Mass appears to attract mass and all life appears interrelated; and just as Newton's theory of gravity was proved "wrong" and replaced, evolution will find a similar intellectual fate."
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks for that unrelated intellectual discourse. Yes we have superseded Newton's work on gravity. I could randomly throw in many ideas of the ancient Greeks that have been disproved too. Your point is what? That because one idea has been shown unsound all ideas will be shown unsound eventually? That wouldn't hold much water with the evolutionists I debate with I can tell you.
<BR>

<BR>
"Bah, every single cosmological theory without exception amounts to mathematical wanking. They're all impressive intellectual accomplishments which should be pursued for their own sake, but they're gibberish nevertheless."
<BR>

<BR>
I totally agree. Trying to explain the origins of the cosmos without a belief in God is pointless. God is the one who created the mathematical laws in the first place so how are we going to explain his creation in terms of them? The order in our universe is one of the clear testimonies of the existence of a God.
<BR>

<BR>
Instead of assuming my position on this area, how about you be bold enough to tell us where do you stand on this issue and why.

I don't care about my pride, I have none. You can abuse my pride all you like because I have surrended it to Jesus Christ.
<BR><BR>
Secondly, tell me exactly how I conveyed my belief in evolution in my first post. I was trying to be objective in order to gather an honest opinion from Mr tkatchev -- I apologise for any unintended point I may have conveyed but your offensive tone is unwarrented.
<BR><BR>
"I think evolution, like its cross disciplinary relation capitalism, has become the secular religion of modernism. I think it explains -- very poorly -- a lot less than its adherents would have us believe, and I expect it will eventually become scientifically discredited."
<BR><BR>
Agreed. I believe evolution has always been on scientifically shaky ground. Evolutionary theory stems primarily from the desire for humans to rid God entirely from their lives.
<BR><BR>
And despite secular thought, there is a large amount of evidence to support the theory of creation. See <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.com">my favourite site on creation for more information if you like</a>.
<BR><BR>
So I can see you do not believe in evolution which is a great, but what exactly do you believe in?

Take a large number of universes, with completely random rules of their behavior (math and physics laws). Let them exist on their own. Some universes will collapse.

<BR><BR>
Again. Take a random system. Run it in an infinite loop, iterating over and over. Maybe it will diverge to plus or minus infinity - and collapse. Maybe it will converge to a fixed value, and become a stable but static and dead system. In the most interesting cases it will stabilize in a set of stable attractors. For more details about such systems check ie. <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/FLAOH/cbnhtml/index.html">The Computational Beauty of Nature: Computer Explorations of Fractals, Chaos,

<BR><BR>
The "order" in our universe is just a proof that our universe is one of the possible stable ones that behaves interestingly enough to allow formation of life. Says *nothing* about if it was designed intentionally or just emerged randomly.

However, we have known since the beginning of the 20th Century  that these "laws" are nothing of the kind; Einstein's theory of general relativity is not at all compatible with Newton's "laws"
</blockquote>

Obviously you never really learned your physics.

<BR><BR>

Einsten's laws are completely compatible with Newton's laws.  To make this point even more clearly, the laws of quantum mechanics are also compatible with these other laws, and vice versa.

<BR><BR>

If you're computing the course of a baseball, then any of the three `laws' will work just fine.  Newton will give you accurate results quickly.  Einstein will require a lot more work, but will also work.  Quantum mechanics will require massive amounts of computational power to completely model a macroscopic body like this without the massive number of simplifications made for all but the simplest cases, but eventually it would come up with the same answer.

<BR><BR>

Newton's laws break down for the very small (where quantum mechanics take over) and for the very fast (where relativity takes over.)  But for the vast majority of `real world' calculations, Newton is *more* than accurate enough.

<blockquote>
(for instance, Newtonian mechanics cannot be used to accurately describe the orbit of the planet Mercury.)
</blockquote>

Newton's laws calculate Mercury's trajectory extremely accurately.  Using relativistic equations will increase the accuracy -- but the difference is incredibly small.  (yes, I did read your link.  The difference is noticible -- but still *very* small.)

<BR><BR>

Does Nasa even bother taking into account relativity when they calculate the course of a space probe, for example?  My guess is probably yes -- yes, the difference is miniscule, but computers are cheap and space craft are expensive.

<blockquote>

Relativity, on the other hand , is consistent and measurably correct on virtually all levels, with the possible exception of situations involving extreme mass and energy where quantum effects can no longer be ignored.

</blockquote>

Um, there's no `possible' exception here.  It's *certainly* an exception.  When you get that small, you cannot ignore quantum effects.  Of course, at the atomic/subatomic level, things tend to move so fast that you often can't ignore relativistic effects either if you want any sort of accuracy.

<BR><BR>

Newton's laws can be deduced from the laws of relativity or the laws of quantum mechanics, which makes them less `all encompassing' than the other two sets of laws.  That doesn't make them any less useful, especially in every-day calculations.

Of course they most emphatically are not. 
Their mathematical models may predict nearly identical numerical answers, but so will charts of tabulated numerical measurements gathered by theoryless observation. The relativistic "explanation" (theories, in the layman sense) for those measurements is literally a <i>revolution</i> in Newtonian mechanics. In fact, aside from pedestrian tweaks, refinement and incremental advances in technology, progress in science is a history of revolution in ideas, one radically different world view supplanting another. 
This is what distinguishes scientific genius; if you employ existing science to describe a hitherto unconsidered or "difficult" aspect of nature, you are not a genius. You havent advanced our <i>understanding</i> of nature at all.
<BR><BR>
Think about the implications of all this: The notion of science as a series of <i>revolutions</i> in <i>ideas</i> undermines the modernist's casual, uncritical belief in the cult of the scientificist. Either we understand  everything because everything is already understood, or we are locked in a cycle of revolutionary ideas. The former means the scientist's opportunities for employment as the high priests of knowledge are numbered. The latter means we understand nothing at all and never will.
<BR><BR>
Note that science remains perfectly useful without ultimate understanding ("explanation"). That's because scientific explanations are, like all rational (language based) explanations, irrelevant or, as I prefer to believe, nonsensical. 
Although the progress of science will describe gravity's causal effects subject to increasingly sensitive measurement and unravelling of the causal chain, gravity itself will remain inscrutable. As will the inter-relatedness of life despite evolution's current celebrity status.

I think the problem that you're having is that you need to distinguish between accuracy of results and general correctness.  A scientific theory can be completely bogus and still produce accurate results within a certain problem domain. For example, I could claim that there is an invisible chimpanzee named Chuck that grabs all thrown objects and pulls them towards the ground, accelerating them at the rate of 9.8 meters per second.  Were we to test this theory, we would find its predictions to be highly accurate.  Nevertheless, you would (I hope!) agree that this theory is complete nonsense, regardless of the accuracy of its preductions.<BR><BR>

This is of course a silly example, but it is in this family of theories that Newtonian mechanics belongs.  On Earth, and in pretty much any reasonable reference frame, it is "good enough" to produce accurate results, but to say that Newton's ideas were "correct" is simply .. uh, incorrect. :-)  Many of the basic foundations of Newtonian mechanics are wrong.  One of the most obvious faults is the way the Newton regarded time.  Time, he claimed, was a sort of a universal, eternal railroad track, endlessly chugging along, and completely disconnected from the three spatial dimensions.  The insistence on the idea of "absolute time" is one of Newtonian mechanics' most fundamental undoings.<BR><BR>

Now, of course, we know that this is not the case. Time is most certainly <i>not</i> separate from the three spatial dimensions (or 11 or 26 spatial dimensions, depending on which version of superstring theory that you buy into.)  Each observer has his or her own unique measure of time, and while this fact is largely meaningless to six billion people who are (essentially) in the same reference frame, it is significant in other applications.  You asked if NASA incorporates relativity into its calculations, and I can tell you (from job experience) that they do.  Earth-orbiting satellites must take relativistic effects regarding time into consideration; if they didn't, we would have some problems.<BR><BR>

Now, when I say that Newtonian mechanics is "wrong" in the grand scheme of things, I do not mean to detract from Newton's achievement (<i>Principia Mathematica</i> was a staggering accomplishment .. one of science's most important publications), nor do I suggest that it is not useful or it should no longer be used or taught in schools.  I only mean to point out that since its introduction, we have learned that Newtonian mechanics is flawed in several of its most basic assumptions about the nature of the Universe.  We should still teach it, because for all situations that schoolchildren are going to be exposed to, it is very accurate, and it is <i>far</i> easier to learn than relativity is.  I, like you, do not want to be teaching eighth-graders about Lorentz transformations and a non-Euclidian continuum.<BR><BR>

I think that we agree on much of this and are just niggling over terms such as "correct."  In much of your reply, you are arguing <i>for</i> my position far better than I am capable of doing.  Literal Creationism, like Newtonian mechanics, is "wrong" from a standpoint of correctness, but like Newtonian mechanics, it needs to be taught in our schools because it is easier for children to digest and has a far smaller chance of jarring their fragile sensibilities and causing them to inflict great harm, either upon themselves or others.  You never hear about kids shooting up a school because they learned that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
There is a problem with this question - it doesn't have sense. "Before" and "After" are terms that are dependent on time. Existence/behaviour of time is dependent on matter/energy. Time is also commonly refered to as one of the dimensions. The matter (or energy, in some situations - ie, extremely high temperatures and energy densities - it isn't practical to distinguish between them) and all the dimensions appeared at the moment of Big Bang. The nature of the Singularity itself is as far as I know unknown yet. The time 0 is also the very moment from when the terms like "before" and "after" start giving sense. You can't ask what was "before Big Bang" because there was no "before" because there was no time itself.

<BR><BR>
Very well, then.  Let us abandon this talk of "before" and "after," since it bothers you so much.  Let's try the question this way:  What caused the Big Bang?  Or like this:  What created the Big Bang?
<BR><BR>
No need to fuss over Time not existing before time started, or whatever this technicality is that you're trying to use to dodge the question.
<BR><BR>
I know what you're going to do next.  You're going to tell us that there was no cause, that the universe came about as a result of random oscillations, of chaotic fluctuations, that it is merely one of countless permutations.
<BR><BR>
And you will be begging the question again.
<BR><BR>
Oscillations of <i>what</i>, exactly?  Fluctuations in <i>what medium</i>, pray tell?  Permutations of <i>what</i>, good sir?  The Catholic astrophysicist would answer, "the mind of God."  You, on the other hand, are forced to answer with words that cause you tremendous discomfort:  "I don't know."  
<BR><BR>
What's more, science can not answer these questions.  Ever.  If you had even a basic understanding of philosophy in addition to all of your memorized equations and tables and theorems and constants, then you would have come to grips with this by now, one way or another.
<BR><BR>
You prefer the life of a highly paid craftsman to that of an intellectual.  There is nothing wrong with that.  But when you try to solder a brittle technician's answer onto a timeless philosophical question that you are not sufficiently learned to address, you  make a fool of yourself, and you make your fellow engineers look foolish by association.  Do them a favor, and admit that you are out of your depth.

Me, I don't believe in God, but that's not really germane at the moment.  What matters is that I don't think that there is an answer to the question of where the universe came from, while Captain Soldering Iron seems to be very sure that he and his Science have it all figured out, pretty much, with just a few details here and there to be filled in.
<BR><BR>
I do think Cosmology can be pretty interesting stuff, but not when it's just a few ignorant pissants wrangling over whose made-up story gets to be called the "truth," with a handful of morons egging them on from the cheap seats.

Fussing over the origin of The Universe seems pretty silly to me, because I can't really be sure that <i>I</i> exist in the first place, let alone that the whole damned universe is actually <i>there</i>, you know?  I mean, the best I can do, really, is cling to Descarte's little aphorism, and plenty of holes have been punched in that old chestnut at this late date.

Personally, I get the feeling that the Universe would rather I didn't ask it when it got here, and whether it took a cab or the subway, and did it bring its sister along, and where was it last Thursday, anyway?

On the contrary, that's the only thing you <i>can</i> be sure about in this cruel world. You might not exist in the form you think you do (brains, jars, etc.), but by considering your existance, you accidentally prove it.

Perhaps you could provide a few references. Descartes had many ideas, and many of them were flawed, but I'd love to meet someone who postulates that entities can consider their own existance without actually existing at the same time. Such a person would be a bigger contrarian than I am.

Yes. "I don't know" brings discomfort. It's what propels the research. Or what brings the need to use an obsolete kludge to soothe that discomfort - insert god(s) into the unknown.

I wouldn't be so sure. I think time will prove you wrong. What we know is that philosophers hadn't managed to come up with a suitable answer for millenia. So don't be so harsh to physicists when they hadn't got good-enough-for-you results in the couple decades the modern physics exists.

Before I get to that I would like to applaud gbd for actually writing an <i>controversial</i> article rather than the same old "follow the crowd and call it controversial crap I usually read.  It seems most of the controvery is raised from the readers or at least the editors who result to immature name calling (ie stupid lunix teenage hacker terrorist).

<BR><BR><b>Nevertheless, I maintain that schools need to teach Biblical Creationism.</b>

<BR><BR>You could not refer to it as <i>Biblical</i> as there are many people that do not follow the same religious beliefs as others.  Secondly, you cannot use the majority due to separation of church and state and the freedom of religion.  Yes separation of chirch and state is in the Contitution despite what Pat Robertson and his followers believe:

<blockquote><i>"There is no such thing as separation of church and state in the Constitution. It is a lie of the Left and we are not going to take it anymore."</i> <b>--Pat Robertson, November 1993 during an address to the American Center for Law and Justice</b></blockquote>

<i>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof..."</i> This simply wouldn't work if there wasn't a separation of church and state. A theocracy would inevitably violate the First Amendment. Separation of church and state is the only way to insure that freedom of religion is kept.

<BR><BR>No matter how you look at it every religion or belief system does support some kind of creation.  They are however, no always similar.  I however, can explain the wonder of the universe, and both proove evolution and creation (all beliefs) at the same time.  However, I will not tell you all.  Why?  Next thing I know soneone jackass (and there are many here and not limited to the readers).  I will however, give you some clues.  I'll explain it using examples from the Bible as many people here usually discuss it more often that any other text although I still believe they are all just books that are completely full of shit.

<BR><BR>God (or may be you prefer Allah which is the Arabic word for God or the Great Spirit like the Native Americans) created man in his image is a belief of many religions.  Does this mean God looks like a man?  Nope.  There is also a verse in the bible which reads "<i>the true kingdom of heavy is inside us and all around us</i>"  It also says the earth was created in seven days.  What is 7 days to God?  It's not specific.  It doesn't talk about the death of or evolution of Dinosaur that ruled the earth.  Sience say we are all created of the same thing.  You know atoms (uhhh Adam).  What are atome composed of?  Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons, which are components of...?

<BR><BR>So what is it?  <b>ENERGY</b>.  So waht does that make God?  Get it?  If you compress energy into a finite spce what do you get?  A man?  Noooo, you get MATTER.  See where I'm going?  Can YOU figure out the rest of the BASICS (that's right basics)?  There's a whole lot more that'll you'll never know.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

ANd instead of phys-ed, schools should teach a form of martial arts with a like-minded philosophy.  My vote goes to aikido, which (in its true form) focuses on conflict resolution, rather than kicking someone's ass.  If everybody could pretty much screw up anybody else, fights would be much more rare.  (Likewise, if the disparity in gun ownership  weren't so bad, I feel crime would drop, too.  If everyone carried a gun, far fewer acts of random violence would be carried out.  But that's a different topic.)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

What exactly do we risk here? Maybe wrath of a bad-tempered (see the Old Testament) deity that doesn't seem to exist at all?
<BR><BR>
<i>I'm not sure the debate matters anymore. If I find out that a Supreme Being created the universe in six days tomorrow, the newspaper still comes in the morning and my life is not affected that much.</i>
<BR><BR>
The debate itself will not yield anything; the ones talking the loudest are usually the Babbling Philosophers for whom couple millenia wasn't enough to find any decent answer. The ones who have better odds are in laboratories and do real work.
<BR><BR>
<i>I think before anyone embarks on discovering the origin of the speciation of man or the origin of the universe, they should question whether the answer the receive will be worth the time invested.</i>
<BR><BR>
This argument can be used to kill more or less any elementary (non-applied) research in its very beginning. If everyone would "think" this way, we'd still live on trees and arguing over bananas.

Try playing it with two balls. It's much more fun.

<BR><BR>
A piece of both, though luckily they hadn't let their babbling side having detrimental impact to their work. (Tangent: An interesting question is if Bacon, if he'd lived in current political climate, would attract the attention of FBI with his interest in Arabic writings.)
<BR><BR>
<i>I really wish you would stop attacking fields that it's clear you don't understand.</i>
<BR><BR>
I thought it's normal? After all, when all the hackers are criminals (hi, Elenchos!), isn't it time to finally admit that all the philosophers aren't more than just a bunch of prattlers?
<BR><BR>
<i>Philosophy and real science (as opposed to gadgetry) are very closely related. Even the most cursory scientific survey would prove that beyond the shadow of a doubt.</i>
<BR><BR>
Philosophy and Real Science were once overlapping. After the times of ancient Greece they started to slowly separate. They still have something in common, but the best distinction is in the usability (both actual and potential) of their results, and the methods used. Philosophy is now obsolete, all its four main branches: metaphysics by physics, epistemology by informatics, ethics was always a babbling seamlessly replaceable by common sense, and the key answers for aesthetics are buried in the structure of brain, waiting to be extracted by neurology and neuropsychology - together with the basic keys for what we determine "good" and "bad" and subjectivity in general, which ethics claims to be built on, and with the limits of brain dataprocessing capabilities, which are the hidden cornerstone of epistemology. The philosophers are heading to pretty rude awakening; the answers they seem to seek will come from labs.

<BR><BR>
Yes. Metaphysics has no chance to find conclusive answers to anything.
<BR><BR>
<i>No, wait, let me try again. Aesthetics is superceded by neurology?!</i>
<BR><BR>
The best way (and the only one with decent chances to get any results) to answer what is beauty is to take apart and study the circuits of brain that are related to processing of sensory inputs and emotions, to sensing of what we call beauty.
<BR><BR>
<i>Listen up, son. I've tried telling you this in seven different ways, and this is going to be the last time. The scientific method can tell us how things work, but it can't tell us why.</i>
<BR><BR>
Can philosophy tell us why? Can it come with a conclusive answer? What I seen as far is a bunch of babblers arguing for millenia over claims they can't prove nor disprove, not even theoretically. 
<BR><BR>
<i>The scientific method is a technique for inquiry into the mechanics of the universe. It is of no use in answering questions such as "why can a straight line be drawn between any two points,"
much less "what is love" or "what happens to our consciousness after death."</i>
<BR><BR>
I reiterate, what chances has philosophy to come up with such answers? After thousands of years of fruitless attempts, it's time to try brute force and take the world apart.
<BR><BR>
<i>If you claim that the universe is nothing but a mechanical system - a Newtonian clockwork machine with Einsteinian extensions, so to speak - you're not just making a statement about the universe, you're making one about yourself. You're stating that your own consciousness is an accident, without any meaning in itself.</i>
<BR><BR>
Does it have any meaning? I suppose you think so; why do you think so? Any reason to, or just a wishful thinking?
<BR><BR>
<i>You're stating that any free will you might experience is only a "useful" biofeedback adaptation by a successful species.</i>
<BR><BR>
I never said this; however, it seems to be a bit oversimplified but otherwise pretty close.
<BR><BR>
<i>I put useful in quotes because that even invites the question of useful to whom. To your cells? To the species? To your selfish genes? There's no one there to use it if people aren't privileged beings.</i>
<BR><BR>
They are? Why? Wishful thinking, again?
<BR><BR>
<i>As for your totally bogus and insulting dismissal of the philosophical work of such as Einstein, I invite you to consider whether philosophical inquiry wasn't of some use to Einstein when he shattered the reigning physical-science paradigms with his work on relativity.</i>
<BR><BR>
Wasn't it scientific enquiry?
<BR><BR>
<i>There's a reason why everyone thinks relativity when they think Einstein (rather than thinking Brownian motion, or the photoelectric effect.)</i>
<BR><BR>
Yep, it was quite large-scale paradigm shift.
<BR><BR>
<i>Special relativity overturned the Newtonian conception of the nature of time in the universe - which is an eminently philosophic topic.</i>
<BR><BR>
Nature of time is a topic that belongs to physics, not to philosophy. Einstein is a prime example of what happens when you take questions formerly improperly assigned to philosophers and unleash scientists to them.
<BR><BR>
<i>As for touching a nerve, you're damned right. I'm a farmer's son who grew up with machinery and tools. I studied mathematical physics and computer science at university, but I'm doing a graduate degree in music. I work as a political officer in student politics, and I gave a paper at the graduate philosophy seminar two years ago on ethical theory. All these things are vastly interesting to me.</i>
<BR><BR>
Good for you. But be wary about the answers philosophy gives you. It's a nice toy; can be interesting, but I'd not rely on it.
<BR><BR>
<i>I think you're totally full of shit...</i>
<BR><BR>
Is it a suggestion to take a laxative?
<BR><BR>
<i>...to dismiss philosophy. I think it's unbelievably rude and nasty for you to spit on the thousands of smart, dedicated, worthwhile people who study fields other than gadgetry. Good for you that you can do it! It doesn't invalidate anybody else's work.</i>
<BR><BR>
What you call "gadgetry" is a way to *prove or disprove* the claims. Everyone can come up with claims; but only observations and reproducible experiments can back them. This is why scientists were, are, and will stay superior over philosophers.

Better to tell them the truth about pot (its not so bad) and about heroin (it will really fsck you up).&lt;P&gt;Same with religion. If you try to feed them bullshit like creationism, then when they take Intro to Biology in University and discover you lied, they will begin to question all of their religious beliefs.

Recently, there's been a rediculous amount of media coverage of violence among teens and children. With the Columbine shootings (and spiraling from there) the media has gotten rabid about any violence in any school. With all this coverage, it's no wonder people think that children are "going astray." The thing is, the number of kids who've died in an attack by a peer (in school and out) has gone down since the fifties. The difference is that while there are fewer incidents now, they are of a larger scale and are covered in greater depth than in previous years.
<BR>

As for a lot of the trends and so forth that have been "degrading" today's youth, well, I'd like to point out the cause of it. To put it simply, it's parents. For centuries, parents had a tight hold on their kids, keeping them under lock and key, and basically beating the shit out of them if they disobeyed. This fostered a sense of fear, and prevented initiative for a long while on the part of the children. The young age of parents (mid teens) lead to a greater "connection" to their childhood and the strict obedience associated with it, and causing them to play out their designated roles as stern parents to a great degree. Now, fast forward to the early 1900s. By this point, people were becoming parents older and older, taking longer to settle down. This resulted in less connection to the obedience of their childhood. Thus, parents were perhaps not as strict and tolerated a bit more "disobedience." Their children, in turn, had even less connection to a strict childhood, and were even more tolerant of deviances in their children. And their children did the same. And that generation is the one currently in charge now, governing young people. They don't give as strong a message of right and wrong at a young age, and they don't really give a flying fuck about their children in far too many cases. The solution to this problem is not the alienation of teens by force-feeding them messages of a vengeful God. Hell, we may as well warn them that there are angry invisible midgets hiding under their chairs that leap out and kick 'em in the crotch if they don't do exactly what they're told. Instead, we need to get parents to care again, and to instill in their children a firm foundation of the "basic" morals of life. Let them work out their religious beliefs and ideas on their own.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Great argument, but it strikes me that we're already indoctrinating our nation's children for the sake of public bahavior.  Maybe it's different out there in Seattle or San Francisco, but growing up in the Midwest, I felt this same kind of bending was going on with the rules of reality taught in public school.

I also doubt that leaving it for college is a workable solution.  College is just another series of ideological programming experiments conducted by our government.  People complain about a liberal bias in the media, when they should be complaining about a liberal bias in public higher education.  After all, all network news reporters are college graduates.
<BR>

People go to college so that they can reap the benefits of the new merit system, which replaced the spoils systems of the previous century.  What this new "merit system" really means is not that one gains position through worth, but through credentials.  And having gained credentials implies that one has been conditioned to serve the establishment through higher education.
<BR>

<BR>
When you get down to it, it would serve the goals of our government, or as they like to say, our society, to continue this charade through higher education.

I was personally offended by your remarks about the non-college educated.  Not every person who refuses to participate in that farce is a ditch digger.  And I'll have you know that the only religious nut in my family graduated with a BA in political science, and is now a housewife.  I've read more than every rich kid in my college class, and I realize that the only job their degree will get them is one which would be equally attainable if they'd majored in folklore.  A college degree only proves to employers that you're "trainable."

The big belly whoppers on American history are enough of a shock for college students.  We don't need to be messing with their minds by telling them God doesn't exist.  Let's just placate them.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
