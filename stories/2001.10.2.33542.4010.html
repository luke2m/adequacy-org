		If you can keep your head when all around you are losing theirs, you'll be a man my son, as the poet wrote.  On the other hand, if you were the first one to lose your head as soon as things get difficult, and if you're already screaming at the victim of your pointless blame exercise and search for a scapegoat by the time the "manly" types realise that they are in shit deep enough to warrant a raised eyebrow, then come over here; you're my type of guy.  I'd freely admit that I'm not the nicest of people; many would say I'm a complete prick.  A complete prick whose defining pair of traits is on the one hand, a complete inability to listen to anyone else, ever, and on the other hand, an almost pathological need to find someone else to blame for my problems.  This type of personality is pretty common in the investment banking industry; it is certainly possible to make a career in finance by being a nice, rational, honest human being, but I never thought I'd be any good at that, so I decided to dance with the one that brung me.  I'm a short-tempered, blinkered, pig-ignorant, self-obsessed prick.  Don't worry, we'll talk about your faults next week.<p>

Some might have said that, in the circumstances, it was mighty optimistic of me to enter the world of Linux, fundamentally throwing myself at the mercy of people who would both <ul><li> play on my sense of intellectual inferiority and <li>be extremely likely to take offence and leave me to fend for myself if I didn't treat them with respect.</ul>They might have said that, but if they did, I didn't listen.  Here's my story.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I had decided a few months earlier to install Linux because it was cool (I maintain to this day, that this is the <i>only</i> valid reason for a desktop user to install Linux).  I was all set up, I had my beautiful beloved Vaio laptop, all I needed was a Linux.  I decided to go for the "Mandrake Linux" distribution, because a) one of my email buddies had told me it was the easiest to install, and b) they were giving it away free on the cover of a computer magazine that week, and I was fucked if I was going to pay for "free software".  Yes, yes, I've read "The Cathedral and the Bazaar", but let me point out to you that if you've been boasting to your honey for three weeks about how cool you are for installing "free software" and the first thing you do is come home with a box you paid $99.99 for, then she's going to laugh pretty hard.  And the laughter of a beautiful woman can feel surprisingly emasculating, particularly when you're feeling a little dumb yourself, and a hundred bucks out of pocket.  So Mandrake it was.<p>

Here is my first comment of substance on the subject of Linux, which is certainly applicable to the so-called "newbie distro" produced by Mandrake, but which, I think, has more general application.<p>

<b>They broke my fucking computer.</b><p>

Perhaps it is because they are French, and perhaps the words have a different connotation in that magical language, but I venture to say that when Mandrake use the word "resize", as in <blockquote><i>"Would you like to <b>resize</b> your Windows partition?</i><p>(best said with a subtly sardonic Parisian accent)</blockquote>... they do not perhaps realise that most people are going to assume that they mean "resize" in the sense of "make bigger or smaller by stretching or squashing, perhaps affecting the internal bits somewhat in the process, but basically retaining the structural integrity of the thing".  When you use the word "resize" to a normal English speaker, he does not assume that the word means "delete a chunk of, irrevocably, without first checking whether something vital is on it, then render yourself unable to find that deleted block ever again".
<p>
This is the basic problem with the much-vaunted "newbie-friendly" Mandrake Installer; five times out of the six I tried it, its two main functions appeared to be to <ul><li>Seek out and render inoperable any copies of Windows hanging around and <li>Itself fail to install properly.</ul>When operating systems are something about which you have never had cause to think in your pre-Linux career, and when you find yourself staring at a blank screen where a desktop should be, reading in an old school font the words "Missing Operating System", and when you do not know what the hell those words mean, then I must tell you that you tend to go pretty sour, pretty quickly, on the people who put you up to installing the fucking thing in the first place.  So it was with me and Linux.  If you knew me during the Linux period, and if you gave me some advice on how to deal with my computer then know this; the only reason I didn't threaten to sue you, call you a useless shit-heel and send you the very nastiest virus I could find, is that with my computer completely fer-zucked by Linux, I was unable to get in touch with you to do so.  I don't know anybody who knows a fucking thing about computers (the reason for this is that I am not working class).  I am not prepared to shell out money for someone to mend my fucking computer; that's what warranties are for.  I chucked away the warranty card for my computer the moment I opened the box.  Cut off the web connection of my one and only computer, and I am truly and utterly on my own.  So that's when I started buying books.
<p>
Books are one thing I will buy, because I am a bit of an old sap for the feel of the pages between my fingers and the wonderfully brainy weight of a briefcase full of paperbacks on esoteric subjects.  On the other hand, I must confess to having developed a burgeoning resentment of the false advertising of "Free Software" and a growing sympathy for the transparently propagandistic Microsoft concept of "Total Concept of Ownership" when faced with the following calculation:

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Microsoft Windows:
<dd>
&bull; Cost of operating system: $0 (came with the computer)<br>
&bull; Cost of applications: $299 (proper copy of Office, couple of games)<br>
&bull; Money spent on books relating to Microsoft Windows: $0 (the very idea of buying one would have seemed weird to me)<br>&bull; Time spent reading books: 2hrs/year (occasionally looking up how to write macros in the manual)

<dt>Linux:
<dd>
&bull; Cost of operating system: $3.95 (the magazine was fucking useless except for the CD)<br>&bull; Cost of applications: $0 <br>
&bull; Money spent on books: $200 (vast numbers of them seemed to need to be bought to understand what the hell was going on and no one book explained anything properly)<br>&bull;Cost of sitting around drinking nasty coffee in dingy internet cafes trying to work out how the fuck I was going to get my modem to work again:  $40<br>&bull; Cost of <b>entire new fucking computer</b> after I found out that I wasn't going to be able to, because fucking Linux doesn't support it:  $500<br>
&bull; Time spent reading books: all my free time for a fucking week.  <p>You see how the cost mounts up.  And that was just to get my computer fucking working again.  Christ knows how much time and expense I'm going to be put through if I ever decide to do anything with it.
</dl>
</blockquote> <p>

In any case, I find it necessary to mention at this point the people who helped me get my computer back into action.  These are a group of people to whom I feel a degree of gratitude, because they helped to rescue me from the peculiar hell which is the Mandrake installer with handy tips like "yes, the default size of partition is 2Mb for root and 0.5Mb for /usr, no, nobody knows why".  But only a degree, because they refrained from giving me the best piece of advice possible, which would have been "don't fucking bother".  This merry bunch of pranksters go by the name in the online community of "Linux advocates".  The word "advocate" comes from the Scottish term for a lawyer charged with the hopeless task of defending an obviously guilty suspect, and is common parlance among computer types (see the Jargon File) for a mindless zealot who has mistaken the market share of his preferred computer operating system for the girth of his penis, and who believes it to be vitally important that "his" (no, never her) operating system is marketed as efficiently as possible by word of mouth to ludicrously inappropriate consumers.  <p>

However, in the case of Linux, it is inappropriate to call the zealots "OS advocates", as the vast majority of their time is not spent on comparing the features of Linux with those of other operating systems, but rather on making up excuses for the shortcomings of Linux on the desktop, and boasting about the stability and speed of Linux installations (usually webservers) utterly incomparable from the one they are recommending you install.  You may think I am making this up; I wish I were.  I have lost count of the number of times a Linux zealot has seen fit to bring up the subject of the hosting of Slashdot (<i>"and numerous big companies like IBM!"</i>) in the context of a conversation about why I can't read my fucking documents any more.  It is for this reason that I have coined the following truism:<blockquote><b>

Windows and MacOS have "advocates"; Linux has "apologists".</blockquote></b>

Conversations with Linux apologists tend to have three distinct phases:<ol><li>Very erudite-sounding discussion of your problem in terms of software projects which are either pre-alpha vaporware or, more likely, entirely theoretical ideas once floated on Slashdot. ("Yes, what would solve your problem would be the integration of Samba into the kernel with the correct RFS extensions.  I think that this is a problem that Alan Cox is working on in the unstable release of Debian 4.9.01a")
<li>Grudging acceptance that there is no very good or workable solution to your problem under Linux, coupled with castigation of the iniquities of the software industry. ("Well, of course the real trouble is that HP won't open the driver source specifications so the project has to be carried out on the island of Nauru.  Damn that DMCA!  I heard Bruce Perens talking about a secret data repository under the sea like in this Neal Stephenson novel ...."
<li>Banging on for hours and hours about how fucking wonderful Apache is, if you let them.  ("... and even Microsoft runs it for 83% of their intranet servers according to recent Gartner surveys and it really shows that Free Software works in the business environment and it was just put together by this bunch of guys and it just goes to prove ...."</ol>

The important concept to bear in mind when discussing software issues with Linux apologists is the "Linux Fault Threshold".  Clever use of this concept helps you to avoid losing your temper with someone who might actually be able to render practical help, while ensuring that you give the correct dose of venom (60cc of scorpion juice, administered <i>per anem</i> with a rusty syringe) to the vast crowd of mindless apologists who just want you to use their pet operating system because it makes them feel good and gives them something to boast about on Slashdot.  I provide this as a service to all the blind, alcoholic, incontinent grandmothers out there who appear to be installing Linux without any trouble if the Slashdot comments on any article remotely related to user interface design are to be believed.<p>

The Linux Fault Threshold is the point in any conversation about Linux at which your interlocutor <b>stops</b> talking about how your problem might be solved under Linux and <b>starts</b> talking about how it isn't Linux's fault that your problem cannot be solved under Linux.  Half the time, the LFT is reached because there is genuinely no solution (or no solution has been developed yet), while half the time, the LFT is reached because your apologist has floundered way out of his depth in offering to help you and is bullshitting far beyond his actual knowledge base.  In either case, a conversation which has reached the LFT has precisely zero chance of ever generating useful advice for you; it is safe at this point to start calling the person offering the advice a fucking moron, and basically take it from there.  Here's an example taken from IRC logs to help you understand the concept.<blockquote>

&lt;jsm&gt;  Why won't my fucking Linux computer print?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt;  what printer r u using?<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  I don't know.  It's a Hewlett Packard desktop inkjet number<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; hewlett r lamers.  they dont open source drivers     <b>&lt;------LFT closely approached!</b><br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; but we reverse engineered them lol.  check the web.  or ask hewlett for linux suuport??<b>&lt;------ but avoided, he's still talking about the problem</b><br>
&lt;jsm&gt; Thanks.  I already did that.  But I can't install the drivers on my fucking computer.  I've got a floppy disk from HP, but my floppy drive is a USB drive and Linux doesn't have fucking USB support.<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; linux DOES have USB support!!!!!!<br>
&lt;jsm&gt; yeh for fucking infrared mice, and for about a thousand makes of webcam it does.  Get real here.  For my fucking floppy disk drive, I am telling you through bitter experience it does not.  Even if someone has written the drivers in the last week<br>
&lt;jsm&gt; which I sincerely doubt, how the hell am I going to install them given that my floppy drive doesnt work?????<br>
&lt;jsm&gt; this ought to be in the kernel.  what good is a fucking operating system that doesnt operate?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; Imacs dont have floppy drives at all  <b>&lt;----- useless point, but not LFT.  All apologists make pointless jabs at other OSs</b><br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; so you ought to be greateful that Linux does.  drivers like that shouldn't be bundled in the kernel<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; makes it into fucking M$ bloatware. bleh<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; download drivers from the web!!!!  apt-get is your friend<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  So everyone keeps telling me.  Unfortunately the fucking modem doesn't work under Linux either, and since the Linux installation destroyed Windows, that leaves me kind of fucked.<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt;  Linux doesnt destroy windows<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;mandrake installer does.  It "resized" my Windows partition and now the fucker won't work<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt;  you shuold have defragmented.  windows scatters data all over your hard drive so the installer cant just find a clean chunk to install into.  it isn't linux fault     <b>&lt;---- distinct signs of LFT being approached</b><br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; that windoze disk management blows<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  so why doesn't my fucking modem work?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; what computer hav u got<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  A Sony Vaio PCG<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt;  that doesn't have a modem<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  I assure you it fucking does.  I used to use it to check my email back in the days when Windows worked.<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; its got a winmodem.  thats not a modem  <b>&lt;----- nitpicking over technical terms is a sign of impending LFT</b><br>
&lt;jsm&gt; what do you mean?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; a winmodem isnt a proper modem.  it just uses proprietary windoze apis. doesnt do the work of a modem at all.<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  Very interesting.  Now how do I get the fucker to work with Linux?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; well the trouble is that micro$oft won't open up the drivers they just keep it proprietary and becos theyr a monopoly all the lameass manufacturers fall into line<p>
<B>LFT REACHED !!!!!</b><p>
&lt;jsm&gt;  So in other words, my fucking modem is never going to work with Linux at all?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; no no no. in the first place you never had a modem you had a winmodem.  in the second place its M$ fault that the drivers are closed and you can go to jail for trying to reverse engineer them like this guy dimitri skylab and the DMCA.  its nothing to do with linux that M$ fills the world with its proprietary crap<br>
&lt;jsm&gt; But in terms of actually getting my computer to work with Linux, I get the impression that it won't?<br>
&lt;linuxbabe&gt; M$ should have to open up the drivers have you read CatB?  and vaio sucks because they won't open up their standards either.<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;  Congratulations on wasting half an hour of my life, you fucking loser.  And stop pretending to be a fucking woman.  Your advice is useless.  You, and the other hundred members of the so called fucking Linux community for which you stand, have broken my computer, wasted my time, patronised me senseless, revealed your lack of real knowledge, patronised me again and you *still* can't get something as simple as a fucking laptop computer to fucking work.  Your so called free fucking software, like your <br>
&lt;jsm&gt;
 so called fucking free advice, is still too fucking expensive.  I cannot believe that you have so little fucking self-respect that in order to find the attention you clearly crave, you have to spend your life lying about the usability of a fucking computer operating system, purely for the joy of creating problems which you can then pretend to solve.  You are worse than a fucking fireman who sets buildings on fire.  I have had enough of your fucking Munchausen-by-proxy version of tech support.  Now get off<br>
&lt;jsm&gt;   this fucking channel, hunt down someone who knows what they're fucking doing and bring them here or I will never, repeat never, use your fucking system ag ....<p>---DISCONNECT ---
<p>
That's basically what it's like.  Don't ever, ever believe anyone who tells you that you can get technical support from "the community".  Because "the community" with whom a computer journalist, website operator or Open Source loudmouth interacts, is not the same community that is open to you.

Saying that Apache is bloated is an understatement; it simply boggles the mind -- personally, I have no idea what they did to accomplish this.

Horrible is not the word for it.

If you want to write, say, a 3D shooter in Perl, you could certainly do it.  However, it would be slower than molasses on a cold day, since it wasn't designed with 3D graphics in mind.  If you really want to write a decent 3D shooter, you would use C++ or possibly C, because, although it would take longer, they are designed to handle that kind of task and therefore, the benefits would outweigh the costs.
<BR><BR>
Now, look at Apache.  Of course it's a bloated pile of shit, it is designed to do everything but slice bread.  If you want to use dynamic web pages using, say, Scoop and mod_perl, you can do that easy, and the facilities are already built in.  Similarly, you can handle things such as authentication, directory attributes, and other things, including SSL.  If you've ever looked at the documentation, there are more or less a million and one different options that you could play around with in the configuration if you really wanted to.  
<BR><BR>
If you want to get a small, fast web server for static pages, go with something like Tux.  If you want to get something designed to specifically run Perl or PHP, you should probably look at proprietary servers, although I'm not really familiar with those so you'd probably have to do some research.
<BR><BR>
Honestly, the only other open source software package that can even come close to the Apache kitchen sink approach is Emacs, which contains, among other things, its own web browser, news reader and elisp interpreter, which I think we can all agree is totally overboard for a goddamn text editor.
<BR><BR>
<i>If you think Apache is bad, take a look at BIND.</i><BR><BR>
You are right, of course.  BIND <b>really</b> sucks.  Personally, I prefer the clean, standards-compliant Windows 2000 DNS services, as they make things easier when managing enterprise-class networks, as any competant network administrator will tell you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Why spend so much on books when all the HOWTOs can be found at linux.com or linux.org
<BR>

<BR>
OEM Windows is NOT free.  The manufacturers pay licesing fees to MS which they pass on to the customer.
<BR>

<BR>
Resizing a partition is just that.  Is "squishes everything into unused space.  Resising a partition using a utility included with Linux distro is the same as with PArtition Magic.
<BR>

<BR>
I gather from the article that you are someone who want to point and click your way around an OS and if you can't it's a piece of shit.  Linux is not for you.
<BR>

<BR>
Is Linux ready for the desktop?  Yes and No.  If you are looking for a multimedia OS then NO it's not.
<BR>

<BR>
MOST Linux distros DO support USB.  Just like Windows it is supported through DRIVERS.  Hewlett-Packard offers very nice support for Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
This belief that driver support and this driver and that driver should be BUILT INTO the kernel is rediculous.  Believing that "well it is in Windows" is too.  Many people mistakenly believe that the Windows OS and the Windows kernel are the same thing.  NTKERNEL does not have a built in GUI, drivers, etc.  It is what it is.  A KERNEL.  A kernel, plus a GUI, software libraries, and everything else makes up the OS.  Linux is a kernel.  Red Hat Linux, Linux Mandrake, Open Linux, etc. are OSes (aka distros).  Same goes with WINDOWS.  If everything was built into the kernel, the program would be HUGE.  There would also be no control over which services to install because everything would need to be loaded.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Linus Torvalds lives in Santa Clara, California, USA.  He moved here from Helsinki, Finland.
<BR>

<BR>
He currently works for Transmeta.
<BR>

<BR>
Linus doesn't sit around in his house JUST hacking the linux kernel.
<BR>

<BR>
For those of you who absolutely MUST jump on the word HACK or CRACK, hacking the kernel is in no way a reference to hacking or cracking a network.
<BR>

<BR>
There are also good hackers, bad hackers, and in-betweens.  They are known as WHITE HATS, GREY HATS, and BLACK HATS.
<BR>

<BR>
White Hats &gt;&gt;  Think of them as the GOOD GUYS.  They are typically hired by companies to test and monitor network security.
<BR>

<BR>
Black Hats &gt;&gt;  The BAD GUYS.  They typically hack systems and walk a fine line between hacking and cracking, while sometimes crossing it.
<BR>

<BR>
Grey Hats &gt;&gt;  White hats that use unconventional means of flushing out the bad guys.
<BR>

<BR>
Along these lines there are a few other, like BLUE HATS, GREEN HATS, etc.  These are mostly bullshit in an attempt for teenage wannabe hackers to make a name for themselves.  There the guys who find daddy had written down his password to a porn site.  They believe this SOMEHOW makes them hackers.  Sometimes they are also used for those who hack other OS kernels.
<BR>

<BR>
Along the lines of WHITE and GREY hats the term Red Hat was created for those who hack the Linux kernel.  At least this is the rumor of where the name Red Hat originated.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Take for instance your typical linux apologist: He's been working for MONTHS on just getting his operating system installed and his computer somewhat working again.  He's spend HUNDREDS of dollars and WEEKS of reading books trying to figure out how to perform the various tasks required to run linux. (As you mentioned)
<BR>

<BR>
Now this guy.. is he going to have the guts to look back on the last six months of his life and say "God, what a fucking waste of time.  Now where'd I put my Windows 2000 install disc?"
<BR>

<BR>
Nope.  He's going to say "That was time well spent.  Now I'm going to try to learn how to use Emacs/vi/XWindows/etc" then proceed to waste the next sixth months doing something he could have done in six minutes on Windows or Macintosh.
<BR>

<BR>
People have a hard time criticizing themselves.. telling themselves they made a mistake and wasted time.  So instead they convince themselves that they in fact are right and to reassure themselves of their rightness they go around and tell everyone else how great it is.  Yet, in fact, they fucked up.
<BR>

<BR>
So, Linux apologists, isn't it about time you be honest with yourself?

I am saying this to ward off the knee-jerk response of accusing me of being die-hard "Linux apologist".  I use both Linux and Windows 2000 at home.  I think they are both great operating systems and both have their merits.  This discussion pertains to Linux, so I'll just stick to it.<br>
<br>
I admit, I've spent an inordinate amount of time famliarizing myself with the Linux operating system.  To most people, the time I've spent would not be worth it in the least.  However, computers are my hobby.  I enjoy learning about them and Linux provides a great way to do that. As those of you who have tried it out have learned, Linux does not have a glossy user-friendly interface for all it's functions.  You actually have to learn about the protocols being used and the commands being issued.  This is the main reason why I say Linux is not for the average consumer. However, for me, this is perfect.  This is the type of thing I am interested in.  The kind of thing I would like to know about.  Microsoft products do not provide an oppurtunity like this.  Linux does.<br>
<br>
The average consumer does not want to spend time learning the ins and out of their computer system.  It's damn near a requirement to do that to really familiarize yourself with the Linux operating environment.  The average consumer shouldn't touch Linux becuase it really wasn't made with them in mind.<br>

From there I explored the various dirs and started "man"ing every filename I saw in /bin, etc. My goal was basic unix-like literacy.
<BR><BR>
Sure, its more complicated now, there are so many more devices to support, etc, but Linux just installs nicer nowadays too. Redhat basically installed during a lapse of attention of mine when I was pondering how hard Redhat was going to be to install, and I looked back and the computer started doing all kind of crazy stuff, like giving me a KDE desktop, etc. But that doesn't mean you don't have to do a bit of research. For all the other wannabes reading, heres a heads up on the basic "compatibility list" for a Linux installation; if you don't have the needed resources (compatible hardware, suitable distro, reading ability, brain) then do like the other fellow said, just buy the t-shirt.
<BR><BR>
24 months? sheesh, I have a feeling thats not all that has been wasted here :-D Please guy, have mercy on yourself, hug your Windows CD.

<BR>
No, it wasn't totally wasted. I did learn Berkely Sockets (and how WinSock is just ever-so-slightly different). I learned a lot about Unix in general. I learned to love no-nonsense programming editors and command-line compiler utilities.
<BR>

<BR>
I also learned there are just some areas where Linux will probably NEVER compete with paid-license software. I spent 24 months waiting for a professional-level audio editing/mixing/MIDI sequencing package. That time was definitely wasted, but it was my fault, not "The Linux Community's" fault.
<BR>

<BR>
There are just some packages that are insanely difficult or boring to code. Audio software falls into this category. There is not enough ROI to bother writing this software for a small community that will probably "warez" it the first chance they get. I certainly wouldn't do it, so I was a fool to think someone else would.

Could I have gotten something to work with a regular Soundblaster? Of course, but the sound quality would be completely unacceptable. I'd just as soon record with my son's Fisher Price cassette tape deck.
<BR>

<BR>
Beyond that, the last time I checked (several months ago) there were two different sound driver models still in use (OSS and kernel mods, IIRC). Alan Cox had been leading the kernel-level efforts to support sound/MIDI but he apparently either got bored or frustrated and simply stopped. I even went as far as getting some of his old kernel patch code and tweaking it to run on a newer kernel. The new OSS system didn't support any of my (not uncommon) hardware at all. I could buy an OSS-supported card, but it would mean taking a hit in audio quality. I didn't spend good money on quality AD converters and shielded electronics just to downgrade to a sound card meant for bitchin' Quake explosions.
<BR>

<BR>
And this, more than anything else, demonstrated to me that the open source model has some significant weaknesses. Namely, developers who simply stop work because they lose interest and redundant incompatible systems that do the same thing (*cough* *KDE/Gnome* *cough*).

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hmm- interesting. I'm also involved in video editing, and there's an interesting point here, which relates quite closely to the earlier comments on audio editing (which I also hear a  fair bit about- the other director of my company is an audio engineer). 
<BR>

<BR>
As far as I'm concerned, there are two schools of video software. School 1 is the "HUUUGE app of editing doom" school, complete with 5000 different functions, insane flexibility and the general ability to do all the things that would, pre-computer, either have been impossible or required literally millions of dollars' worth of equipment. I'm thinking Premiere (or SpeedRazor, or the Avid apps), AfterEffects (or Combustion, or Flame, or Aura) and that ilk. The audio equivalent would be SoundForge, Cubase or whatever. 
<BR>

<BR>
There are no usable School 1 video editing packages available free, to the best of my knowledge, that even come close to the non-free equivalents. I would love to be proved wrong on this, BTW- do post if you know!
<BR>

<BR>
School 2, on the other hand, are little utils, generally created to perform one or two major functions that the big packages are, well, crap at. File conversion. File compression. Specific editing tricks. Here's where all the OS programs come in: VirtualDub, DivX (the codec o'God) and so on. There's a lot of very useful Open-Source or Free packages here, many of them better than anything commercially producesd (DivX, for example- VirtualDub is still in a war with NewTek's Vidget for me, but they both do things the other doesn't). 
<BR>

<BR>
Interesting, huh? Also pretty obvious. The place where free software slips up is on the massive commercial apps, particularly those that require very complex GUIs and a lot of WYSIWYG functionality, and particularly in more niche markets (which is why there's no free SoundForge equivalent, and not a lot of free 3D modelling packages). 
<BR>

<BR>
Why? Because, in short, such packages are beyond the reach of all but the absolutely most exceptional volunteer team. We're talking about things that require literally man-decades of work. And so, it's likely that very few will be produced, as it really is an area where the only way that the software will be produced is if the resources are available to pay the programmers, and currently business models for OpenSource development of wide-scale commercial apps are a little thin on the ground. 
<BR>

<BR>
IMO. 
<BR>

<BR>
As a postscript, with the rise of Linux as a video editing and 3D platform in the major production houses, it's likely we'll see those houses developing more software for Linux, and probably releasing it as OpenSource. However, because these houses are already working with existing commercial software, it's unlikely that any of that software will be a wide-scale replacement for the popular commercial apps- instead, we'll likely see even more really useful, free niche applications for the one or two jobs the big companies didn't feel were done properly by any of the major commercial applications. 
<BR>

<BR>
Which is still kinda cool.

Seriously, this is possibly the finest critique of the Linux experience I have ever read. Unlike you I am fairly well versed in computing and still I ran into many of the same problems you did. I chucked Linux for plain vanilla FreeBSD servers and use my Macs for desktop stuff. I find the BSDs to be better than Linux for server stuff and I find a stick and a clear patch of dirt better than Linux for desktop stuff. I agree wholeheartedly that 'being cool' is the only valid reason for installing Linux.

In the Lunix communtity however, "supported" means "it's theoretically possible to construct an arbitrarily long string of ones and zeros that would allow you to do this."
<BR><BR>From the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/support/resources/faqs/rhl_general_faq/s1-hardware.html">Red Hat FAQ</a>:
<BR><BR><b>Question:</b>
      <BR><BR>	How can I get my WinModem(TM) to work with Linux?
      <BR><BR>	<b>Answer:</b>
      <BR><BR>	Unfortunately, WinModems(TM) are completely incompatible with Red Hat
	Linux version 6.0 and earlier. There is no work-around for this issue at
	this time. The problem is that WinModems(TM) and similar type modems use
	the CPU to emulate various hardware that is removed to save on
	costs. These hardware parts that are removed would have to be "emulated"
	by the Linux kernel and would require the hardware maker of the modem to
	write such drivers.
      <BR><BR>	There are a few (very few) winmodem chipsets that are compatible with
	the 6.x versions of Red Hat Linux. The best place to go for more
	information on these versions is the <a href="http://www.linmodems.org">www.linmodems.org</a> and <a href="http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html">http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html</a>.
	Both have links to information and drivers for various WinModems(TM).
      <BR><BR>	For Red Hat 7, there is, unfortunately, even less support.  This is
	because many of the drivers available (such as the popular ltmodem
	driver) are compiled for versions of the Linux kernel that are old by
	today's standard.  Red Hat 7 ships with the 2.2.16-22 kernel which has
	shown some trouble with some of the drivers.  The ltmodem driver, which
	was compiled for kernel 2.2.12-20 seems to become unstable at 2.2.14-12
	(the errata release kernel for Red Hat 6.2) though it seems to be
	usable.
      <BR><BR>	We have no direct knowledge of other modem drivers, however, and welcome
	more information (see the contact information at the top of this document).

<BR><BR>
In reality, its because of the Microsoft monopoly, you have folks who literally would be out of luck if it weren't for Linux. There are things that Linux can do that are simply unavailable or price prohibitive in a Microsoft solution. Mac's are out, because you'd have to buy their hardware to run their systems, which seems pretty silly to me.
<BR><BR>
Because of the monopoly, the hardware folks _have_ to focus on Microsoft, rather than any hardware standard. Now some folks will say that Microsoft _is_ the hardware standard, and there is some validity here (look at all the "build for Windows" type things), but that can also lend some insight to just how lopsided the desktop/server market is at this point.
<BR><BR>
Ultimately, unless Microsoft can manage to make free software illegal (don't kid yourselves folks, they have a real good shot at doing this), Linux, BSD, and other open source solutions will affect the market place sufficiently enough to bring some sanity back. Sadly, for the everyday joe-user like the author, Linux isn't there yet, but for folks with some computer experience, Linux is an amazing tool.

That said, Linux is a marvelous piece of work, given the lock Microsoft has on the market. Truly revealing that some users are so dissatisfied with Microsofts products that they can write its replacement for free. Imagine how great Linux would be had Linus had some funding behind him? I really just continue to be amazed at how Linux can really whip Microsofts ass in some areas where being a monopoly doesn't help.

This is utter bullshit.  You don't realize what it is you're talking about.  The situation is clearly explained on the front page of <a href="http://www.linmodems.org">linmodems.org</a>.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is possible to write drivers for winmodems.  The manufacturers of winmodems do Microsoft a favor and distribute them with Windows drivers.  Plese note that this has nothing to do with Window's being more "advanced" or with the competency of Windows developers.  This is due to Microsofts dominancy in the desktop OS market.  If a manufacter were to release a modem which implements most of it's functionality via software without support for Windows, they're automatically cutting off the majority of the market for their product.<br>
<br>
Linux developers must develop the drivers for winmodems (and lots of other various hardware) themselves.  Most of the time this is without any assistance from the manufacturers of the hardware.  <b>This is in no way a level playing field.</b><br>
<br>
Microsoft has all the work done for them by the manufacturers.  Linux developers must reverse engineer the hardware and drivers in order to create the equivalent in Linux.  Because of the situation, Linux hardware support cannot help but lag behind that of Windows.  Once again, this has nothing to do with incompetency or laziness of Linux developers.  It's just the reality of the marketplace.<br>

I was not trying to whine.  I was just trying to inform the person accusing Linux developers of being "lazy" or "incompetent" of the situation they face.  You cannot deny the fact that Microsoft has an advantage in the hardware support situation.  It's a bit crazy when the most hyped "competition" for the Intel compatible desktop market is only used by about 2% of userbase.<br>
<blockquote>...the geeks start whining.</blockquote>
Once again, before your proceed with the "you're a dirty geek" "argument", I am not a Linux fanatic.  Yes, I use it.  I use it alongside Windows 2000.  They both have their merits. Etc. etc. I've gone over this in earlier posts<br>

The difference between a controller-less modem (or "winmodem") is that some tasks done in hardware on a traditional modem (such as command interpretation, error detection and data compression) is done by the driver and not by a microcontroller in the modem. A controllerless modem basically just does de/modulation and A/D, D/A conversion. This hardware is not Windows-specific, but it does require much more feature-rich drivers than a traditional modem.
<BR><BR>
It's perfectly feasible to write such drivers for Linux too (<a href="http://linmodems.org/">some try</a>), but after several years of their existence, Linux support still sucks...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Following my failed attempt to install Linux, I have now installed <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> on my trusty old 486. The OpenBSD installation went very smoothly, although the disk partitioning wasn't as simple as it could have been. Although OpenBSD still doesn't run my Windows software, it is very similar to Solaris which I am already familiar with (probably because the BSDs are based on a Solaris "code fork") and I am already able to do many tasks with my new software. OpenBSD is also very secure by default - in fact, it is renowned for its security.<BR><BR>
But the thing I liked most about OpenBSD is that it sends you a nice little email when you first log in, giving you a step-by-step guide to setting up the system. Truly, both Linux and Microsoft could learn a lot from OpenBSD. In my opinion, OpenBSD is well worth the cost of an official CD and it is one open source project that is worthy of support.<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

I should have told them that it isn't worth the work to port <a href="http://www.apache.org">a patchy server</a> to win32...

But of course, the best performance is gained by running a site on <a href="http://www.amiga.com">AmigaOS</a> with Miami. The win32 environment uses a very slow message passing system between different tasks. The AmigaOS just passes a pointer to a message in memory to the task who requested it. Thus it is far more superior!!! Even to Linux! And even more superior to this microkernel crap like <a href="http://www.qnx.com">QNX</a> and <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/">The Hurd</a>!

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'd have to agree with you on this point, as I am in sort of the opposite predicimate of the article's author.  You see, I am running Windows right now, but I want to start developing some apps for a Linux machine connected to the network at school.  Since I have a hell of a lot more free time at home than I do at school, I figured that it would be all around better to just install Linux on this machine and get cracking.  
<BR><BR>
Well, lo and behold, it seems that not one of the decent distros that I have tried in the (recent) past has any idea about how to make a stable install program.  Since there's no way that I'm going to pay for Linux, I decided to get the floppy images and download the distro via FTP.  Bad idea.  I try SuSE first.  OK, it boots up and gets me to the main menu.  However, when I try to insert the module for my network card, the fucker dumps core.  <b>DUMPS CORE!</b>.  So, although it had the option of installing via FTP, there was no way it was going to happen. 
<BR><BR>
Next, I downloaded the Mandrake images from their site and wrote them to floppies.  I boot it up, and it turns out that you are required to have their fucking CDs to install the fucking distro.  Why is it that FreeBSD can do this but the so-called "newbie" Linux distro can't?  Blech.
<BR><BR>
So, despite the fact that I would love to be using Linux right now to play around with socket programming and other stuff in C, there is no way that is going to happen unless I find time to steal the SuSE 7.2 CDs from the system administrator's office sometime soon.

<i>Now, since when is giving the end-user the power to modify packets insecure? It gives the user more power, I don't see how the two relate.</i>

Indeed.  It gives the end user more power <b>FOR HACKING!</b> The two relate like this: whenever you give the user more power, you give them the responsibility to use the power in a proper way.  Would you give seven year old a Glock to bring to school and help himself in playground fights?  It's the same idea.  Tools like Nmap shouldn't just be handed out like candy.  Tools like this should require a licence <i>at least</i>, and possibly should be banned altogether.

<BR><BR>
Just <i>pretty legitimate</i>, hua?  Is that a little grey area I detect there?  Just like "Back Orifice" is a "System administration tool" that just happens to allow you to <b>FUCK WITH SOMEONE'S COMPUTER ILLEGALLY</b>? Sounds like Nmap is a destructive weapon of "hackers".

<i>"Windows, which is must more secure than Linux, does not allow you to run such an insecure program which can only be used to "hack" other peoples' systems. "</i> <br><br>
I was arguing that it's not insecure to Linux, in fact it makes Linux far more powerful that it's TCP/IP stack isn't crippled like window's is. Secondly, your glock analogy doesn't hold up since nmap isn't destructive on it's own. It is simply a centralized way to bring together a lot of information that is obtainable by perfectly legitimate and allowed methods. If you make nmap illegal (or ban it, roughly the same thing), then only the outlaws will have it. This won't stop anyone with skill in terms of security, as nmap doesn't do anything unique. Furthermore you'ld be taking it out of the hands of people that use it legitimately to analyze problems in their own networks (and if you are familiar with the field, you'ld know that there are many, many administrators that use it this way). The only gray area you detected was in the way that I worded it, and for that I apologize. It has as much gray area as any other tool, as most tools can be applied in either negative or positive ways, depending on the person using them. The difference between back orifice and nmap is that back orifice was designed with the intention of being stealthy and open to anyone that wishes to connect, and this is a malicious design. Nmap was not designed for malicious use, though as I've already stated it can be applied that way much like any other tool. Therefore the two don't compare. And finally the only thing that I admitted was that it can be used maliciously, but this doesn't make it special and I never denied that. It is a good tool, it is neither 'right' or 'wrong'. To think so is foolish. <br><br>So in conclusion, shouldn't you be out petitioning to ban sharp objects simply because they can be used dangerously instead of wasting precious time posting on here? <br>

How about hardware tools that can be used for destructive purposes?  Why should software be singled out?  Since we can take a fully loaded and fuled piece of hardware from Boeing and destroy a 110 story building and thousands of lives, I guess we better be adding airplanes to the list of banned things.

Think about it for a moment. The vast majority of air travel is business related. Businessmen travel around often on the flimsiest pretexts in order to rack up their 'frequent flyer' miles. On the other hand we have the tourists flying to foreign lands on vacation.<BR><BR>
The first group of people simply do not need to fly any more. With netmeeting, it is possible to have a face to face meeting with anyone anywhere in the world, without shelling out $$$$s for an overpriced 'business class' airline seat.<BR><BR>
The tourists simply spend their US dollars elsewhere, contributing to the GDP of other countries.<BR><BR>
So there you have it. Pointless travel everywhere we look. It seems reasonable to me to ban airline traffic except for where it is needed on grounds of national security (say moving troops for example), as a temporary measure, until we have clearly and cleanly defeated the Muslims and put an end to terrorism.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

But let's examine one of the protcols you metioned.  This particular protocol IS in WINDOWS.  Ping.
<BR>

<BR>
Ping:
<BR>
Short for Packet Internet Groper, a utility to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible. It works by sending a packet to the specified address and waiting for a reply. PING is used primarily to troubleshoot Internet connections. There are many freeware and shareware PING utilities available for personal computers.
<BR>

Ping is therefore NECESSARY.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

For instance, it took me years to grok standard operations like cutting and pasting from a clipboard (being an emacs fool, I tried to teach people how to "yank back the line from the kill-ring", usually resulting in blank stares).
<BR><BR>
I struggled for years to learn how to use the "mouse" and "gui", but to no avail. I've realized now, that I am forever stuck with substandard tools like emacs, pine, and lynx; while my non-educated friends are much more productive with industry-strength solutions such as Outlook, Word, and IE.

Yes, I'm a Linux apologist. A very, very bitter Linux apologist.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<br>
That warning especially applies to laptops.  Laptops provide a trickier hurdle to the prospective Linux user.  Since a lot of the components of a laptop are customized and/or proprietary, you should double check to see if the hardware is supported.<br>
<br>
This generally isn't a problem for Windows users, since a requirement for releasing any PC hardware in today's market is insuring Windows compatibility.  That's just one of the luxuries of having a majority of the consumer OS market.<br>
<br>
While Linux doesn't support every piece of hardware on the market, I find it amazing it supports as much as it does.  It is truly the most flexible OS on the market now.  No OS can boast the ability to run on everything from x86 to Power PC to SPARCs to Alphas to S/390s and more (For those less technically savvy, those are all different hardware platforms, most home computer users use either x86 (Intel, AMD) or Power PC (Apple)).<br>

Linux's marketing has been telling us for years that linux works on more computers than windows, but the factual evidence we see again and again that is that linux does not even properly support the computers that windows runs on. I can only assume that in order to claim that you got linux running on a particular computer, you need only get the machine to boot once, without doing any decent work. This may be enough for your g**k penis measuring contests, but it does not provide the functionality that is needed in the real world.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Do me a favor.  Open the terminal in a Linux distro and type MAN [command].  Here's an example:

<BR>
man ls
<BR>

<BR>
This will give the necessary information for various commands.  MAN short for MANUAL.  It works kinda like /? in Windows.  As far as paper manuals, do you think you're gonna get them if you download a distro? NOOOOOOOO.  Did you get a paper manual when you downloaded Windows XP RC2?  NOOOOOOO!

It's a hobbyist's OS. If you want an operating system that doesn't crash and doesn't require a reading level over the 6th grade, get BeOS or, at the very least, MacOS. These are easy to use for those of you who have to have to have "everything pretty or it doesn't work right." I've been using linux for two years and BeOS for a year and a half; both are stable (I have been using WinXP for two weeks, and it has crashed on me more times than linux and Be together have in the past 2 years.) and motherfucking powerful.
<br><br>
So, if you don't like how the documentation treats you in linux, DON'T USE IT, or write something better. At any rate don't complain about shit you don't understand. (That's gonna get some response.) Documentation is <b>not</b> the reason that Windows will be a dominate OS in the coming years. There are many reasons for that; none of which have anything to do with support or documentation.

I could tell you sad tales of trying to _reinstall_ windows 2000 on a (previously) working computer because it was acting a bit strange that left me with no computer for weeks.  And About the winModem that refused to work with windows 2000 (even though it said it would on the box) which, when I called tech support, they asked me which version or 2000 I had (I'm skipping the part where I had to open the machine and remove the modem card and then put it back in, twice) and said finally "Oh--it needs the full version, not the upgrade."  I pointed out that the WinModem box didn't say anything about that.  They felt my pain.  They assured me I would be able to get my money back.
<BR>

<BR>
But the point (and I DO have one) is that once you start messing with your OS & hardware, you're looking for trouble--be it with Linux or with Microsoft.  You just happened to have YOUR trouble with Linux, but that's partly a coincidence.

<BR>

<BR>
From support.microsoft.com:
<BR>
"Back up all critical data on your hard disk. Although it is unlikely that you will encounter a serious problem when you install Windows 98, it is always a good idea to perform a complete system backup before you install a new operating system. When you upgrade your computer's operating system, an error might occur (such as a problem that is the result of incompatible hardware or a power failure) that could temporarily or permanently prevent you from gaining access to the data on your hard disk."
<BR>

<BR>
from www.linux-mandrake.com:
<BR>
"In case you decide on a classic install and have never installed GNU/Linux before, DrakX will have to resize your Windows partition (if any). This operation can be harmful to your data, therefore you must perform the following steps before proceeding: 
<BR>
you must run scandisk on your Windows partition; the resizing program can detect some obvious errors, but scandisk is better suited for this task;
<BR>
for maximum data security, you should also run defrag on your partition. This further reduces the risk of data loss; this is not mandatory, but is highly recommended and doing it will make resizing much faster and easier;
<BR>
the ultimate insurance against problems is to always back up your data!
<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
Even the Beast tells you that there might be problems with their holy software so it is your own fault for not making backups.
<BR>

<BR>
The Mandrake installation does not "illegally" modify your MBR, it ASKS you where you would like to install the bootloader. Have you EVER seen a Windows install ask you where to put the bootloader?

<BR>

<BR>
Really, well then why don't you just fdisk the parition (by the way fdisk.com is DOS).
<BR>

<BR>
How do you fix the boot block?"  I think you are referring to the Master Boot Record (MBR).  Try this:
<BR>

<BR>
FDISK/MBR
<BR>

<BR>
Then you can completely reinstall Windows.  These commands are good if you have a dual boot (Linux/Windows or Windows 9x/Windows 2K).  I repeat this is NOT some Linux hacker thing.  FDISK is a DOS command (you can also find it in the /dosutils directory of most linux distros, packaging this is NOT illegal, so shut up).  It can however, only recognize Windows partitions but can easy FDISK the MBR.  You will need delpart or the OS parition utility (included with NT OSes like W2K) to remove Linux partitions.
<BR>

<BR>
The fact that you did not know this makes me question your computing knowledge.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So maybe the proper graphic would be a paper doll in  terrifyingly un-sexy underwear, together with some leather clothes and some tie-dye and some crap industrial band T-shirts and some "sports sandals" and a fucking purple cloak, and then we could have some role-playing game manuals and comic books and hair dye and computer parts strewn about for good measure.
<BR>

<BR>
These days, the guys who look like the gent in that graphic that you dislike are all playing in shit bands trying to be Weezer, but since they are doing this in an attempt to get laid, it would be inaccurate to call them geeks.

Steve Jobs was one of the original founder of Apple.  He is currently the CEO.  Obviously if you don't know who Steve Jobs is then you should really not attempt in any way to come into any discussion about computer history in an attempt to  sound intelligent.
<BR>

<BR>
You probably hang out with those guys that think that UNIX is a backwards engineered DOS.  Kinda hard to backwards engineer something that hadn't been written yet.  If you don't know history don't attempt to make people think you do.

It was used as an example of people who have their heads up their ass and don't have a CLUE what the hell they're talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
It amazes me that the INadequacy-family likes to argue "we are not technical people, quit talking about geek stuff" yet wants to argue technical points.
<BR>

<BR>
The best example are the idiots running around screaming how TELNET is nothing but a Linux hacker thing and how it's not in Windows.  I love the quote some editor made that they will be talking to their lawyers, because some people used telnet or the GET command to find out what OS was running on Adequacy.org's Web Servers.
<BR>

<BR>
Not in Windows:
<BR>

<BR>
Sart &gt;  RUN &gt; telent
<BR>
or
<BR>
net start tlntsvr from the command prompt

<BR>
I made that mistake one time too often too. Just think about it, which linux guru has time to hang out on irc? Real linux guru's hang out on newsgroups, or on mailing lists, irc is completely braindead as a linux aid. But, actually, the whole of the internet is braindead as a linux aid.
<BR>
Your best bet to get help installing linux is to take your computer to the closest linux users group. I did that with my laptop. All unsupported hardware (or so I thought). Turned out it was perfectly possible to install linux on it and get every single piece of hardware attached to it working. All I needed was someone with a lot of linux experience.
<BR>

<BR>
In general, linux distro's suck though. I can install ANY distro and immediately point out at least 5 major flaws that I could personally fix. And I'm no guru.
<BR>

<BR>
In my experience, the best distro to run is debian, since it's made by volunteers, who actually try to build something they would be proud of, not something that's ready by the next deadline. The dumb things about debian is that the default install dates from the dinosaur era, and that the installation software is absolute horror. Where the other distro's installs do a lot of stuff automatically (and screw it up), debian's install doesn't do anything automatically, forcing you to design your own partition layout, and to choose your own kernel modules to load. It sucks. Majorly. But luckily you only have to do it once, and after that it'll run forever.
<BR>

<BR>
But if you have a reasonably fast desktop machine, stay away from linux. Linux isn't ready to replace windows as a desktop OS yet. Give it a year or two. Server usage, sure, programmer's workstation, well, maybe, but desktop, no way. Ofcourse, I use it as my desktop OS, but then it took me a long while to get there. It's just that my drive to get away from MS was so strong that it overcame the barriers thrown up by linux to reach enlightenment :)

Yes, the hardware is obsolete.  Yes, it's hardly used.  But Linux provides you a way to use it, instead of resorting to throwing it in the trash because it won't run Windows XP and the latest version of Office.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Or perhaps Linux users being honest and saying "Linux is easy only if time means nothing to you because you're sure going to need plenty of it to ever get this fucking OS to work..."</blockquote>
Linux isn't easy.  Especially if all you've ever used is Windows.  It was built using an entirely different OS framework and does almost everything differently than Windows.  Don't let yourself be blinded by hype; when you install Linux, you're trying out something totally different than what you're used to.  Expecting a completely smooth transition is foolish.  You have to educate yourself about the OS you're trying to use.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>I'll stick with the inferior (i.e. usable) Windows. Sure, I won't be using it as a firewall but at least I'll be able to use it for things that actually matter in the real world.
</blockquote>
Linux is usable.  You just have to learn how to use it.  I apologize if you were given the impression that that task wouldn't take any effort.  You can do "things that matter in the real world" on Linux too.  Email, chat, web browsing, word processing, graphics manipulation, programming, web developing are all tasks that are easily done in Linux.<br>
<br>
Contrary to what it seemed you were implying, firewalling is a task that matters in the real world too.  Unprotected computers on any sort of internet connection (especially always-on broadband connections) need to be secure from crackers, virii and such.  This seems to be something that most adequacy.org are aware of, seeing as how they are (too) quick to point fingers at "hackers".  People's who's computers have been compromised risk data and productivity loss.  Especially for the average consumer, having to reinstall your OS becuase of a virus infection is a pain.<br>
<br>
Another bit to think about.  Give the average consumer a computer with an unpartitioned hard drive, a Windows CD and a boot disk and tell them to install Windows.  The average computer user wouldn't know what to do without consulting documentation (and would still run into problems they don't know how to solve, just ask anybody who does tech support for a living).  That's the task that every prospective Linux user faces.  If you plan on repartitioning your hard drive and installing a foreign OS, you need to back up your data and take the time to educate yourself on what it is you're about to do.<br>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">WARNING to all readers (especially linux, FSF, Open Source devotees):  Read the mission statement, faq, etc. of this site b4 spending another second here.  The editors and regs at this site are very firm in their anti-GNU/GPL, anti-linux beliefs.  There is not a great deal of open-minded attitude in the comments I have been reading.  I just read a comment that claimed that the Open Source objective was to destroy large software companies!  Sorry, but I work for a large software company and think Open Source is the only way to go.  Why wait for someone else to fix your problems when you can dig in and do it yourself. Arguing is fun when done between open-minded individuals, there is no gaurentee's that anybody here is even listening.  There are some hidden adgenda's here that we are unaware of.
<BR>

<BR>
I am not a FSF-OSource-linux apologist, nor a Bill Gates crusader (as it appears 90% of the other's involved in the discussion fall into one or the other).  I am a software engineer who has has no tech religion (can you believe we actually use that in my company's culture statement).  What is the best tool for the problem at hand, that is the question that should be asked before deciding on a solution.  I surfed into this ridiculous thread of wasted time by accident.  A linux help site had a link to it, informing everyone how bad Mr. iat's review was. 
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is a great tool for engineers and hobbyists who need (or desire) to get behind the scenes of the OS and get their hands dirty.  Most of my co-workers use it daily in order to solve the problems our job presents us. It is a tool that can be altered to do (theoretically) WHATEVER you want, it just takes a variable amount of time and knowledge.
<BR>

<BR>
However, linux is NOT easy to use, any one who claims it is must have some substantial computer experience.  Remembering the config/source files that occampany the app you are trying to fix/use is a hassle.  Trying to surf the web with the common version of Netscape shipped with many distro's is painful.  I know, I know, go get Opera, or some other browser but do I want to put the time in just for a browser?  Maybe some, but not all.
<BR>

<BR>
Windows is a tool more suited to the casual user, a great tool for presentations and pretty pictures. Compatibility is of little concern, most people have a Windows PC available to open your MS Word docs. After getting some new hardware, it is much easier to use the packaged driver disk for Win than try to track down the correct Linux drivers on the net. 
<BR>

<BR>
Don't get me wrong though, windows still sucks! It is made by a huge company that must have a $5 QA budget.  It is no secret that their first concern is "time to market" and not "reliability & robustness".  They popularized the terms "service pack & patch".  They go by the sell now, fix later philosophy and they can get away with it because corporations can't make bundles of dough without their software.  It crashes randomly (NT less than 9* & ME, I haven't tried XP yet) and is the most fault intolerant OS I have ever used.  If you try to address it without the proper salutation you get the blue screen of death.  Windows gave the term "3 finger salute" a meaning.  A week ago I had a faulty floppy ribbon and Windows would boot into a BSoDeath after a few seconds, while Linux booted normally under the same conditions, politely explaning that fd0 has failed. Now would the average user understand what the hell fd0 is?  Probably not.  They are better off with the good ole BSoD so they can take the machine to the local techie.  
<BR>

<BR>
I guess the point I am trying to make is stop arguing about which OS is better, by nature Operating Systems suck.  They are made by imperfect people and each has many faults.  Be open minded when someone claims that there may be an alternative solution.  It is useless to argue about the better tool in general because there are too many cases where your argument will FAIL (just like your respective piece of shit OS's!)   
<BR>

<BR>
Instead let's discuss how slick it was for adequacy to drum up so much attention and interest in the last few days.  They managed to get a whole legion of linux lovers to come to their site.  It is a buzz in the many discussion forums.  Marketing genius!  If iat had written about how easy Mandrake was to install half of us would still think adequacy was something we strive for in bed, now we know it is actually a website!  IAT must have invented the term devil's advocate.  Anyone want to bet he installed Mandrake in about 30 minutes about 2 years ago?  I have tried to be rational in reading the comments here, but it seems their are far too many Microsoft stock holders nervous about the possibility of some competition.  Here's a tip: buy some long term puts!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Quite to the contrary.  If you had even bothered to read the rest of this site, or even a small portion of it, you would realize that this is one of the most open-minded, and therefore controversial, sites on the internet.  Nowhere else will you find such radical opinions being posed in an open forum, followed by clear, well thought out comments.  Perhaps you were thinking about <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">that other site</a> where they make claims of openmindedness, but in reality have a huge slant in favor of whatever happens to fatten the wallets and stock options of the editors.  
<BR><BR>
This site, my anonymous troll friend, is a labor of love by the editors and administrators.  Please withhold your rude and ill informed judgement until after you are actually aware of the facts.  Anymore trolling on your part will be met with severe sanctions at this site, as we have a strict no-trolling policy.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Don't make any points <i>as a g**k!</i>  Instead, just make your point as a human being, who knows some things, doesn't know other things, and has the ability to reason, within bounds.
<BR><BR>
The most obnoxious g**k characteristic is a mildly autistic trait:  lacking something called "theory of mind."  "Theory of mind" is the awareness that what is in the minds of others and what is in one's own mind can be, and usually are, two different things.  What you know and what others know are not the same.  What you like, and what they like, are not the same.  The fact that your experiences do not correlate exactly with others' is <i>normal</i>, and not a reason to think they must be "idiots" and "morons" (perhaps the two most frequently used words in the g**k vocabulary).  It all boils down to this:  yes, you like Linux, and don't find it useless.  Very nice.  Most of rest of the human race has as much use for it as a football bat.  That doesn't make <i>them</i> stupid.  So, if you insist on making your point from a g**k perspective, thinking the way g**ks think, then make your post on slashdot or some place like that, where that sort of thing is considered an asset.  Here, it is nothing but a big "kick me" sign waving from your butt.
<BR><BR>
Look out now, because the clues are coming straight at you, hard and fast, and I ain't gonna say this twice.
<BR><BR>
This lack of "theory of mind" also cripples g**ks with their most hilarious weakness:  they can't tell when someone is lying to them.  So while our semi-autistic friends will fumble around with blinders on, clinging to some absurd faith in a particular computer platform or language or protocol simply because they get their friends that way, and these sad sacks <i>cannot</i> be reasoned with under any circumstances, they can be made the object of endless fun by certain less than scrupulous individuals.
<BR><BR>
Now I'm not saying it's right to play these kinds of games, and I would never do it myself.  In fact, the <a href="../index.html">best web logs</a> actively prevent this kind of cruel teasing.  However, when one realizes that since our g**k friends habitually take everything they don't understand and label it "moronic" or "retarded" and then easily step from there to deciding that since they don't understand the majority of human society, it must be full of "idiots", and <i>therefore</i> everything ought to be forcibly redesigned to g**k specifications (the Right Thing), and that <i>all of that</i> is basically Nazism by any other name, well, then who can blame those who want to have a bit of fun at the expense of our visiting autistic fascist nerd Lunix apologists?
<BR><BR>And while Adequacy is not at present a "gated community" it is not entirely open to just anyone.  If it were, then posts would not be deleted, nor accounts shut down, nor IP addresses blocked.  Clearly, this web log is intended to be open only within certain well-reasoned and appropriate limits set by the owners.  I don't know them very well, but I can tell you they aren't 100% normal people, okay?  The sometimes creep me out a little bit, to tell the truth.  So don't have too unrealistic a set of expectations as to how free and open the discussion is on this board.
<BR><BR>
Now.  Since you're going to stick around, apparently, I've been meaning to ask you something.  Is your real name in fact actually Charles K. Lee <i>Junior?</i>  You're not a king or a pope, so why would you need Raman numerals after your name to keep track of which one you are?  Just wondering, that's all.

The two are fairly reconcilable, especially since true facism never shows its face until it has assumed absolute dominance. Eric Raymond and Richard Stallman are two of the most insidious crypto-fascist marxists I have ever seen.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

6 month ago I bought a brand newish HP Brio computer. I installed Win2k - it did NOT recognized correctly (or at all) the following
<BR>

<BR>
my printer (HP930C USB)
<BR>
my ISDN card (PCI)
<BR>
my monitor (Sony)
<BR>
my CD writer (HP USB again)
<BR>
my ZIP drive
<BR>

<BR>
Yeah, download it from the web. Without connection...
<BR>

<BR>
Then I installed Mandrake Linux8 - went without a hitch, recognised ALL hardware, so I could download my win2k drivers, 30 megs total.
<BR>

<BR>
BTW installin win2k AFTER Linux destroys the Linux bootability - who is trashing the computer??<BR><BR></FONT></td>

TRUE.  And if you don't think so...

CHECK www.microsoft.com and run a SEARCH.  Oh wait I forgot Windoze user can't type worth a shit.  I'll they can do is point and click everything.  If it ain't got an ICON it ain't you can't do it in Windows.

PLEASE tell me this is a Joke.
<BR>

<BR>
I've been reading article after article from this site, And I believed it was just a bunch of jokes and games, but this article actually seems serious.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
And you idiots who  make comments about how linux is too hard, What the hell? do you think computers are TOYS????? Computers are supposed to be complicated.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, if you want easy to use, just to check your email and surf the web, use windows, or the mac, Linux is for the POWER user.
<BR>

<BR>
IF you have state of the art hardware and want to run state of the art cutting age software you need linux.
<BR>

<BR>
You wont find cutting edge on Windows and if you do be prepared to pay $600-800 for it.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is tough to install because its FREE. Did you buy it? Hell no, So if you didnt buy it, Then you are on your own.
<BR>

<BR>
IF you buy it, THEN you have the right to get made at Redhat or Mandrake and yell and complain and write negative articles.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
First, Before you install anything, learn to read the documentation, You would know how to resize your partition and so on, its explained in documentation and tutorials all over the web, YOU DO THIS BEFORE YOU INSTALL. Didnt you guys go to school? cant you do your homework?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Second, Linux doesnt have good hardware support, WHY? Because YOU didnt donate money to the programmers who write the drivers in their free time, want better hardware support? Donate money!!!! 
<BR>

<BR>
Windows is $200, If you paid $200 for Linux, Linux would have perfect hardware support too.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Lastly, Linux is for the power user, not the newbie, Linux is a desktop OS for the POWER USER, 
<BR>
Newbies should be using Windows98 or WindowsXP until they graduate to Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
You dont get in over your head, if you dont know how something works you dont touch it.
<BR>

<BR>
IF you cannot figure out how your computer works, how an API works, how a kernel works, how your drivers work, and so on, Then you should stick with Windows, When you learn how stuff works, Linxu is easy.
<BR>

<BR>
I've had problems installing Linux, i never complained, I LIKE LEARNING. Any power user WANTS to learn how things work and doesnt mind failing a few times before they succeed.

The fundamental question of open source:
<BR>

<BR>
Why devote time and hard-earned professional expertise to something you'll never see a dime from?
<BR>

<BR>
Answers (in order):
<BR>

<BR>
Personal need for the product 
<BR>
Interesting problem to solve
<BR>
Glory/reputation/respect
<BR>
Charity
<BR>

<BR>
If none of those factors are present, the product will NEVER be written. 
<BR>

<BR>
As far as corporate open source packages (e.g. StarOffice), those only exist as enticements to build marketshare. Funny how Microsoft giving away a browser is bad but Sun giving away an office suite isn't.

Open source people dont donate alot of money because most of them are college students who have no money.

In fact i have no money but i still manage to donate about $5 every few month.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
When open source software gets to the casual users people will donate more money because then they'll have more money.
<BR>

<BR>
Think about it, if you want games, you MUST donate money, It makes the economy run, the stock market works in a similar way, you donate money in hopes that you'll get a return.
<BR>

<BR>
A company like IBM will donate a billion dollars knowing they'll get a return, it turns the software industry into more of an stock market.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Allow me to explain a small part of the geek mindset:
<BR>

<BR>
If it's closed source, software is a good, as in a saleable product, which people are immorally requiring others to treat as such, even though software cannot possibly be property. (Property is a capitalist myth, of course.)
<BR>

<BR>
If it's open source, software is magical rain from heaven, that is free to all, and costs nothing to produce, not even effort, because the fairies and imps who make it love to work, just like the elves in the story about the cobbler. It's all about the dignity of labour.
<BR>

<BR>
But the cruel gods of capitalism demand sacrifices of money from the poor software imps in return for the mana that the imps use to eat, and build the computers that they use to make the magical open source code, which is not only perfect engineering, it is also Art, and transcends both Art and science (especially economics).
<BR>

<BR>
Even though the software imps are perfect programmers, and there are so many that all bugs are "made shallow" as they say in their quaint speech, sometimes evil hardware demons and diabolical closed source afrits summon bugs to infest the software imps' code. The imps must fight long and hard, through strange incantations on newgroups and discussion forums, by which they cast out the demons and afrits.
<BR>

<BR>
Of course, to you and me, it just looks like whining and self-deception. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

First off I doubt Pixar, and Industrial Light and Magic are just a buncha teens with no money.

<BR>
I myself am not a teen but I must tip my hat at some of the thing they are doing.  The people who are doing revolutionary thing with computers nowadays are getting younger and younger.
<BR>

<BR>
Microsft, as well as many other companies, try to recruit many of these young people right after they finish college.  Sometimes before they finish or even before they finish high school.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't believe that TEENS are doing some amazing things read this little article:

RedHat does have an install option that will destroy your windows. It does clearly state this. There are tens of thousands of users who have installed linux next to a windows partition and had no problem. Do a little research before you jump into something.
<BR>

<BR>
And for the writer of the article, it is very difficult to take seriously a writer who cannot express his feelings without using four letter words. It shows a lack of thought and creativity, which is probably what kept you from successfully installing Linux in the first place.

<BR>


<BR>
2) *BSD is difficult to install: you don't even get a real distribution. Or have you seen RedHat/NetBSD? Windows comes with a easy-to-install CD.

<br>
But now I don't. I like Mandrake. It's pretty. And useful. And tuxracer is a cool game.<br>
<br>
I now hate Macs. Why? They're easy enough to install, but then what? I can't actually <i>do</i> anything with a Mac. I'm a java programmer. Have you any idea how hard it is to get anything to work on a Mac? It's stuck back in the 1.1 api, and Apple refuse to update it. Theres no command line (read the rant; boy have I changed my tune. This was due entirely to Apple. Thank you Apple(!)), so instead of writing a five line script and pressing enter each time to compile and run, I have to click five separate buttons, one at a time, waiting for each one to finish (Can you say multitasking?).<br>
<br>
The reason I now like Linux is because I was forced to use a Mac. Don't have a Linux driver for a USB floppy drive? Write one. Don't have a Mac driver for a USB floppy drive? Tough. Don't have a Windows driver? What am I saying of course you do...<br>
<br>
Windows works because it's supported by every hardware vendore. Linux works because it's supported by everyone who uses it.
Macs don't work because they are supported by a single megalomaniacal company who want to make every computer into a toaster.<br>
<br>
No computer should be made into a toaster. Computrons are much too precious. No computer should be able to sit in an infinite loop without being able to do anything else. No computer should ever crash, for any reason other than pulling the plug (I must say that Windows 2000 does this better than any other OS I've met).<br>
<br>
Linux doesn't suck. Macs do. Linux may have apologists, but they won't be apologising forever. Apple has fanatics, who will never learn what a computer is really capable of (and are led by people who tell them they really don't want to know).<br>
<br>
If you want to hear a story about not having any OS, and being able to do nothing, read about the time Linus accidentally nuked his copy of Minix while he was working on his new Kernel (before it was released to the world as Linux). Until you could write your own kernel, don't insult those who can.<br><BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Number 1: 
<BR>

<BR>
I have a CTX Laptop... WHICH IS THE WORST KIND! 
<BR>

<BR>
However, I have installed Mandrake-linux and windows on it at the same time. No problems there 
<BR>

<BR>
Money spent: 58 Cents for a CD to copy Mandrake
<BR>

<BR>
Number 2: 
<BR>

<BR>
I got a Linux book to help before I installed. You however were stupid enough not to read first, and that is your fault for destroying windows. If you read you would have seen the thing about defrag. 
<BR>

<BR>
Price of book: $2.89 for Paper to print on My HP Deskjet FROM my Linux Laptop. $18.99 for a Black ink injector thing from walmart.
<BR>
Price of book/User guide online : FREE.... price of it in store ---&gt;$29.99
<BR>

<BR>
" Money spent on books: $200 (vast numbers of them seemed to need to be bought to understand what the hell was going on and no one book explained anything properly)"------&gt; Not a good choice.... i spent 50 cents on a book called "Programming for Linux" from a store (Bldg. 19 1/18)
<BR>

<BR>
Number 3:
<BR>

<BR>
I joined a LUG (Linux User Group) Who to this day are helping me with my problems. 
<BR>

<BR>
Number 4: 
<BR>

<BR>
ALL LINUX SOFTWARE, except for a certain few, ARE FREE. 
<BR>

<BR>
TOTAL SPENT on LINUX STUFF: @$24.00  
<BR>

<BR>
My WINDOWS EXPERIENCE: 
<BR>

<BR>
1:
<BR>

<BR>
Screwed up my laptop. ---- NEW HARDDRIVE $280.00
<BR>

<BR>
2:
<BR>

<BR>
Destroyed my Red-Hat Linux 3 Times
<BR>

<BR>
Cost of damages: $50 worth of clients and numerous hours trying to redo all of my writings 
<BR>

<BR>
3:
<BR>

<BR>
Crashed every week running windows!
<BR>

<BR>
4: 
<BR>

<BR>
Harddrive Erasures: 15 in 2 months
<BR>
    (Under linux: 0 in 6 months)
<BR>

<BR>
5:
<BR>

<BR>
Problems getting online...... Tons of money paid for MSFT stuff 
<BR>

<BR>
Rough Estimate : $200 (Office) (I got this for free with Linux as Star office)  $120 (Games) $300 (other stuff required to run my job) 
<BR>

<BR>
Total spent on Windows: @ $670 
<BR>
Total on linux: @ $24
<BR>

<BR>
In review I think you got bigtime screwed by your choice to go to linux, but that is mostly your fault for not utilizing your resources as Journalists should. However, you did get screwed big time, but Linux does have less faults than MSFT. Personnaly If I wasn't a shareholder of MSFT I'd completely give windows a bad rap.

It's pretty funny. I wonder how many years it will be till we see a whole range of NEW OS's that are cool and fun and easy to use. Which doesn't piss the average 'home' computer user off with dll's and apis and bioss and all this other shite.
<BR>
I want to use apps, not learn about the friggin OS, i don't have all year to read how the fuck they made windows so ghey and owned, i would think it would be the problem of the OS maker to look after their product and develop it so users are happy with it and find itfun and pleasureable to use. Linux and Windows are both not fun nor easy, they are however a joke. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
#1. No backup. EVERY installation instruction I have ever written/read states, numero uno, to completely backup your data before you run setup.
<BR>
You screwed up.
<BR>

<BR>
#2. System requirements. You failed the second step, make sure your system is supported. As in #1, every installation script I've written or read will list the supported systems.
<BR>

<BR>
I know, I know. I hate to read the *ing docs too, even the ones I wrote myself. But guess what? You have no one to blame if the outcome is less than you expected.
<BR>

<BR>
#3. Linux is hard. But guess what, so is Windoze. You didn't know to click Start, Programs, ... the first time you ran Windoze, but you are used to it now. You think you magically learned how to use the TaskBar? H*ll, I went to a friend of a friend's house once and when he found out I was a techie begged me to help him get his TaskBar back to the bottom of the d*mned screen. Try looking that up in the online Help. First you had better know it's called a TaskBar (or whatever the exact spelling is).
<BR>

<BR>
I would compare your experience to buying a new motorcycle, because you thought you would look b*tchin in leather, then b*tching that you have to shift the d*mned thing, unlike your chevie, and besides, you get wet when it rains! And the b*stards on rec.motorcycle.racing can't explain trailing braking without a bunch of physics mumbo-jumbo. F*ck, them f*cking, f*ckheads!

<BR>

<BR>
It's not the OS's fault if a bunch of losers flock to it and set themselves up as apologists.
<BR>

<BR>
It's true that it's important to have a sense of who's going to be able to help you and who's just a waste of your time.  It's true not only in Linux but in life.  You have to use the same skills dealing with tech support people for a commecial product as "the linux community" -- "is this person actually able and willing to help me or just full of shit?"  I speak as someone who's spent a certain amount of time on both sides of the helpline phone.
<BR>

<BR>
It's also true that people who claim Linux is *in general* as easy to use as Windows are full of shit.  Unix in general is (a) something that pays off hugely if you make a certain initial investment of learning in it -- but the initial investment can be steep, and (b) really a command-line-oriented OS; the real power and smoothness and good experience in Unix comes from using it via commandline; it's not yet and never has been as pleasant a GUI experience as MacOS or even Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
But what do you have to think of a guy who claims that he was "forced" to buy an entire new computer to replace his winmodem?  Do they not sell modems separately anymore?  Does he buy a new car when he gets a flat tire?

Second, the partition resizer, has an option to make a disk to restore you partition data if you use it and you lose data. Did you do that? NO! Did you know people start to get annoyed when you use the word fucking in a conversation 50 times? Apperantely NO! Did you know that the total price of your computer includes the cost of a Microsoft windows OEM license and that its not free? NO! Did you know all you had to do is download an ISO image and burn it to a CD to have linux? NO! Dis you do even the simplest things that morons that cant even turn on their computer do? NO you sure as hell didnt call sony tech support and ask them how to recover data even though their techs suck anyway!
