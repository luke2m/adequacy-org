      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">What do you think of when you hear the word 'hack'?  Do you think of an honest American hacking away at a freshly-felled oak?  Do you think of an old-age pensioner trying to get a hole-in-one on the 18th hole?  Do you think of a crazed axe murderer bludgeoning his neighbour's brains out with blow after sickening blow?  No, most of you think of a lank-haired, masturbation-addicted, socially-retarded greaseball, sat naked save for a pair of semen-encrusted underwear, hunched over a flickering monitor, discussing illegal activities such as 'pinging' Microsoft web-servers, or encrypting their tarballs with gzip.  <br>
I think of hacking as the woodman.  I am the woodman.  My keyboard is my axe.  The program is my log.  The splinters are the bugs in my program that must be avoided.  While I could go on a murderous rampage with my axe, slaying all before me in a bloody rampage of bodily fluids and viscera being rent asunder, I instead use my skills for good.  I use the only approved and legal version of L.I.N.U.X., the Redhat operating system, which lacks many of the dangerous tools that malicious users like, such as ping, ssh, and xemacs (used to write many a nimda worm I can tell you).  <br>
While some people will attempt to skirt the whole issue with high-falutin' talk about 'hackers and crackers', there's only one thing that matters at the end of the day: ethics.  Much like when you decide to buy a woman a drink rather than rape her, you must use your hacking skills for good and control any malicious impulses you may have.        <br><br></div>

Pinging a server simply means that you are seeing how long it takes for a packet to reach the server from your computer.  Even if it was bad only crappy servers run windows.
<BR>

<BR>
encrypting tarballs with gzip is not bad either - it's simply a way of encrypting and compressing programs (that you can download from any open source website).

Linux is not spelled L.I.N.U.X. Linux is a form of unix that is widely available.  And i can make redhat have all the "danguerous tools" like ping (which informs you of how long it takes a packet to reach an ip address), ssh (which allows remote shell and ftp connections - very useful for installing a program on your remote server, or transferring a new website onto it), xemacs (a very nice programing/debugging piece of software).  And btw, by redhat box has all of those listed programs.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Sure, "nothing wrong" as in that it doesn't harm the Microsoft mainframes shielded behind the Windows XP Firewall. However, you are still stealing that company's bandwidth and illegally accessing their logon client information, whether you choose to believe it or not.<BR><BR>
<b>the only people who use them are people who think microsoft and intel is the top of the world,</b><BR><BR>
Microsoft is the world's leading software manufacturer. Intel is the world's leading chip manufacturer. What makes that so absurd?<BR><BR>

<b>and amd and linux are made by sweatshops.</b><BR><BR>
AMD chips <a href="./2002.1.28.153048.268.html">are made in sweatshops</a>. Lunix, however, is crafted in the many poorly-lit rooms of illegal hackers across the world, collaborating their outlawed sauce code as their own personal stance against establishment.<BR><BR>
<b>Pinging a server simply means that you are seeing how long it takes for a packet to reach the server from your computer.</b><BR><BR>
Exactly. Where do you think that IP datagram packet is transcribed to? That's right, it goes right through the bandwidth of the company you are hacking. What gives you permission to access Microsoft's corporate mainframe without going through their own <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> servers? Is it suddenly tyrannical rule? Can you just illegally download the login information via your pinging utility from any vulnerable UNIX server?<BR><BR>
<b>Even if it was bad only crappy servers run windows.</b><BR><BR>
<a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> runs Microsoft IIS 5.0 on Windows 2000 servers. Surely you are not calling <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> a "crappy server" - that is an obvious trollish statement and is grounds to get you banned from this site forever.<BR><BR>
<b>encrypting tarballs with gzip is not bad either - it's simply a way of encrypting and compressing programs</b><BR><BR>
Encrypting is not inherrently bad, just like Napster's original intentions, but its abundant use of secretly scrambling the Open Sores codes that violate international laws, like <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">DeCSS</a>, overshadow its original purpose. Thus, it is at the behest of any Freedom supporting, patriotic American to make sure that encryption is expelled from the hands of the terrorists who wish to plot their own little hacker plans against the government.<BR><BR>
<b>Linux is not spelled L.I.N.U.X. Linux is a form of unix that is widely available.</b><BR><BR>
You can try to defend Lunix's hacker userbase all you want, but redefining its objective does no good to your case.<BR><BR>
<b>"danguerous tools" like ping (which informs you of how long it takes a packet to reach an ip address)</b><BR><BR>
By illegally "piggybacking" the bandwidth of the company you are hacking into. Your 'packet' returns with an IP datagram transcript of the server's login data, giving you free reign into the machine should you bypass the Windows XP Firewall.<BR><BR>
<b>ssh (which allows remote shell and ftp connections - very useful for installing a program on your remote server, or transferring a new website onto it)</b><BR><BR>
Yeah, in theory. "ssh" is merely the <i>Back Orifice</i> and <i>SubSeven</i> client of the lunix world, allowing you to spy in on your neighbor while he innocently reads his Hotmail account, replying to his elderly father who's in his deathbed in the hospital, getting his only daily joy out of the emails he receives from his son on his laptop. How dare you.<BR><BR>
<b>xemacs (a very nice programing/debugging piece of software)</b><BR><BR>
EMAX is more than a "debugging" software - with it, you can illegally reverse-engineer the secret codes of Microsoft's software, including the venerable <a href="http://office.microsoft.com">Office XP</a>. Just because the world won't adopt your communist anti-American Open Sores movement doesn't mean you must expose the highly advanced codes of the companies who represent everything we as Americans stand for in our Capitalist system. I really hope you get what's coming to you.<BR><BR>
<b>And btw, by redhat box has all of those listed programs.</b><BR><BR>
Great. The FBI will certainly be pleased with your admission of guilt as the editors of <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> turn over your IP token information. The world will soon be a better place with hacker scum like you behind iron bars.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Apparently Microsoft doesn't know too much about security then does it?  I mean why would anyone want to run a limited software firewall on a desktop operating system to protect their entire network?  You see there is no server version of WindowsXP.  They use Windows 2000.  The nest server OS from MS will be available sometime in 2003-04 and is called Server.<i>NET</i>.  One more thing.  I seriously doubt that MS is dependent on mainframes.  It's likely their running Windows on x86 systems (Intel/AMD).

<BR><BR>Pinging usually involves a few packets.  Each are usually 32 bytes.  Hardly enough to kill bandwidth.  Not to mention that if you are access a system directly connected to the outside world there's about 10mbps or more.  Anything inside that there's anywhere between 100 to 1000mbps.

<BR><BR><b>Microsoft is the world's leading software manufacturer. Intel is the world's leading chip manufacturer. What makes that so absurd?</b>

<BR><BR>Yes we've all read the article.  Great source to point out by the way.  Oh, but isn't it funny how Intel is the one with factories in the Phillipenes and not AMD?  All the equipment, even if it were huddled together, would still take up a considerable amount of space.  I wonder why no one at the Intel factories has ever seen them.  And if they have, why hasn't Intel launched an ad campaign against AMD for this?

<b>Pinging usually involves a few packets. Each are usually 32 bytes.</b><BR><BR>

Economic suicide. Nike was involved in a sweatshop scandal, but Adidas didn't come out the next day with TV commercials denouncing it. The fact is, there's no easy way for Intel to spin the sweatshops in AMD's asian factories for their own gain. Thus, they don't touch it. Smart move.<BR><BR>

That's the worst analogy I have ever heard. <i>Hello</i>, clue train calling. Your proverbial "echo" is more than that. Does it cost you money to utilize the airwaves of the Grand Canyon for your own high-pitched, squeaky hacker teenage vocal chords? No. However, does it cost the businesses whom you are robbing of bandwidth money while you illegally process their logon passwords? Yes. Get some common sense, moron.<BR><BR>

<a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> is not running on "Apache" on any platform. It runs on highly advanced Microsoft Internet Information Server 5.0 on the robust Windows 2000 platform. If you say that <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> "is slow and runs like shit," I think it's time for you to check your own Ethiopian internet connection. It's fine for me, and everyone else who flocks among us.<BR><BR>
<b>However, a simple trip to uptime.netcraft.com reveals that it's FreeBSD.</b><BR><BR>
As has been proven time and time again, Netcraft is a fraud and is used internally by the Open Sores movement to boast their own fake statistics of usage data, when in all actuality, over 82% of Fortune 500 companies run Microsoft IIS on Windows platforms.<BR><BR>
<b>Yet anyone can simply uncompress them if they wanted to. Even the FBI. I mean I could send secrets with WinZip too if I wanted.</b><BR><BR>
Yes, "anyone." Anyone, as in, anyone with high-powered IBM mainframes capable of cracking 1024-XORBIT encryption sockets. Well lookie here, Lucy, the FBI doesn't have time to decrypt the entire nation's collection of illegally WinZipped files just to search for terrorist activities. Their network of mainframes could be put to better use without scum like you bothering them.<BR><BR>
<b>Yet none of you have successfully proven illgel [sic] activities of Linux developers.</b><BR><BR>
Uh, are you ignoring everything I say? They are illegally undermining the freedom and security of our government by offering their own "hacker" operating system whose sole goal is to attack the critical infrastructure that binds this nation's economy together. If that, sir, isn't a crime, I don't know what is.<BR><BR>
<b>Oh yes not unlike Remote Desktop, Remote Assistant or Terminal Services for Windows.</b><BR><BR>
Except the very fact that unlike your "ssh" and "vnc" hacking tools, the three you mentioned are <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/17/2333207&mode=nested">explicitly permitted</a> under Microsoft's Windows license. So, take that to the bank the next time you're illegally snooping on somebody's ATM PIN code with your "ssh."<BR><BR>
<b>Do you actually think you can just take a program like Windows XP or Office XP, open it using emacs and expect to be presented with the source code?</b><BR><BR>
Why the hell else would there be such a cult fanatical following behind such a rudimentary script formatter like EMAX? We all know how easy it is for you in the Open Sores community to distribute the sauce code to the Microsoft Monster Madness games and strip them from their rightfully earned profits - fitting in with your own quasi-socialistic view of how the economy should be run. Well, listen up: it's <i>not</i> how it's run, and nothing gives you and your EMAX the right to change it. Get a job, you filthy nutbag.<BR><BR>
<b>I mean every branch of the military runs Unix/Linux as do reputable organisations like NYSE.</b><BR><BR>
You have to attack the enemy with the enemy. Imagine if the US Military was faced with an onslaught of renegade Lunix hacking computers and they had no idea what to do? Thus, they experiment with their own Lunix defenses against that type of attack. Be thankful.<BR><BR>
<b>Hell most European countries are now involved in their own antitrust cases against The Beast.</b><BR><BR>
That, my friend, is called an opportunistic lawsuit. The EU knows there's money to be had by going after a successful company like Microsoft, so why not do it? Those Euroscum communists have no place tampering with hard earned American corporations.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Your disinformation in the field of computer networking is astounding. Please, before you spread any more of your rumor-mongering, I urge you to at least familiarize yourself with the basic fundimentals of the way the Internet and its computer networking counterparts work. It's the least you can do to make yourself look less foolish than you really are, although only masking the inner lack of knowledge that you possess in the field you profess knowing so much about. By saying that the "data packet(s)" still "reach(es)" my "computer," your extolling of lies to back your point up becomes more rampant. Listen here, buddy, the Windows XP Firewall prevents the illegal datagram packets right at the source of the problem, the big backbones of the internet as your packet is rejected straight from the Cisco routers that listen in on my Windows XP Firewall and reflect your illegal P.I.N.G attacks. Rather than boasting in your own little world of how you'd like for computers to work, further proporting your own little hacker desires, perhaps you could actually stop what irrelevant drivel you are writing, take a step back, and actually think about the nonsense you claim to be true. Maybe, if you are lucky, you will see how utterly clueless you really are.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Even if it is a dedicated box that serves no other purpose, even if it is not a full-scale PC, still it is a computer. CPU, memory, network interfaces, software.
<BR><BR>
A purely hardware firewall and a discarded 486 with a boot floppy of Linux or BSD are mostly equivalent, except that the second case is usually even cheaper and can do more things.
<BR><BR>
I think the expression here should be "dedicated firewall", meaning a piece of hardware with two network interfaces, sitting between the LAN and the hostile world of the Net. Regardless what the internal construction of the hardware is, regardless if its software is in ROMs or on a floppy.

They need people with honesty, truth and the courage to stand up in the face of their Open Sores lies and Communist manifestos and tell it like it is. Thank you, kind sir, for holding out hope.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Windows command prompt is not illegal nor does it require any hacking.  It's available through the START menu or using Run and typing cmd or command (version specific).  Especially with server version of Windows it's the best way to troubleshoot a system when it won't boot to the GUI.  The recovery CD (desktop), REcovery Console and Emergency Repair Disk don't always solve the problem correctly.  Sometimes they make it worse.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm?term=telnet"><i>Telnet</i></a><br>
A terminal emulation protocol commonly used on the Internet and TCP/IP-based networks. It allows a user at a terminal or computer to log onto a remote device and run a program. Telnet was originally developed for ARPAnet and <i>is an inherent part of the TCP/IP communications protocol</i>.

<BR><BR>Although most computers on the Internet that allow Telnet access require users to have an established account and password, there are some that allow the public to run programs such as search utilities.  <a href="http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~jphb/comms/telnet.html">More on telnet</a></blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.yb?term=ping"><i>PING</i></a><br>
(<b>P</b>acket <b>IN</b>ternet <b>G</b>roper) An Internet utility used to determine whether a particular IP address is online. It is used to test and debug a network by sending out a packet and waiting for a response.  More on PING (<a href="http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/Topics/53.htm">1</a>, <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/geektalk/97/42/index3a.html?collection=backend">2</a>)</blockquote>

Why buy a network troubleshooting suite when most of the tools come free with all modern OSes?  Next you'll be trying to convince people that <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/t/traceroute.html">traceroute</a> is bad too.

<BR><BR><b>My hope is that if Windows doesn't remove these exploitable security holes, society will switch to the much less hackable Macintosh Apple.</b>

<BR><BR>Yes I would much rather use the terminal in MacOS than the command prompt in Windows.  I can use standard unix commands rather than DOS/Windows specific commands.  Hello, MacOSX uses a Unix core (Darwin) dummy.

<BR><BR><b>The other advantage of Macintosh's computers is that they don't have fans that drone on and on all day long, driving hackers to even worse states of mental fatigue and instability.</b>

<BR><BR>Apparently you've never actually used a Mac have you?  All Macs have fans.  Even the iMac has internal fans.  What the hell you think that little vent was for?  So it can double as a piggy bank?  Laptops have them too.  Most of the fans are internel as a laptop's guts are so crammed the inside of the thing heats up rather quickly.  They also require adequate ventilation.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Although, the versions of telnet that are supplied with Windows are extremely poor. Can also  be used to connect to just about any other kind of server. The only difference between using telnet and an IRC client, say, is that using telnet you have to type the raw commands yourself. They're exactly the same commands that would be sent by an IRC client, by the way. Same goes for HTTP, NNTP, POP3, SMTP, you name it.

ping: for checking whether a given server is alive and well. You'd want it if you were running your own web server.
<BR>

<BR>
ssh: see telnet, only the data channel is encrypted
<BR>

<BR>
traceroute: to discover bottlenecks in connecting to a server. This message has undoubtedly gone through many intermediate computers on its path to Adequacy, and the slow connection could be either Adequacy's own server or one of the intermediate ones. traceroute allows you to know which.
<BR>

<BR>
There's no "back door" that allows users to run these programs. Microsoft didn't try to lock them away from regular users. Why? Because they're harmless. They're all there, present and runnable, in the C:\&lt;Windows | WinNT&gt; folder, just begging to be run. All the use has to do is perform the non-malicious task of opening a command prompt and typing the command name.
<BR>

As I've said, your idea of licensing computer users and programmers is unworkable. It would create a huge drain on labour within the industry, and like as not computers would fall from grace, taking a sizeable chunk of the global economy with it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Many of the tasks were attempted - more often successfully than not - by the users in my care. With minimal training, an user on the phone can serve as a dumb (sometimes very dumb) voice-controlled terminal interface to a computer. It's much easier to dictate what to do on a commandline than on a picture-based interface.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Let's say you just got setup with a nice DSL connection (this is for example purposes only).  Three days after the tech leaves you have problems connecting to website.  What do you do?  Well in your case because you obviously know nothing you call tech for your ISP.  Here's the steps he/she will walk you through (if the person is any good).  Note:  This is a very generalized process.  You are using Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok let's find out what the problem is
<BR>

<BR>
1.  Go through various reinstallation of netwrok drivers and TCP/IP setup.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  Open command prompt
<BR>

<BR>
3.  Ping the local loopback (ping 127.0.0.1).  Basically this means you make the NIC ping itself.  This will test if TCP/IP is setup correctly.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  Ping yourself.  This means that you must use ipconfig to find out you IP address.  Ping that.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Ping a remote host on the network segment.  Only if you have more than one computer in your house for example that is connected to the network.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  Ping the default gateway
<BR>

<BR>
6.  Ping a remote system outside of your netwrk (ie www.microsoft.com or adequacy.org).  Only 4 echos will be sent with each being only 32bytes.  Hardly enough to cause problems with these sites.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok you've gotten through #5 but you can't get #6.  Using ping you have localized the problem.  The tech support guy cannot do this for you.  It must be done from your system as you have the problem.  So what is the problem?  Using ping you found that the problem is with your ISP.  If you put some thought into you can assume it's with one of their routers.
<BR>

<BR>
Free tool included with Windows can do all that.  These tools will remain in Windows.  If MS wanted to remove them they would.  It's kind of hard to "hide" them when everyone knows they're their (except you because you're stupid and paranoid).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Yes it's nothing like how they gave away Internet Explorer (even while it was infringing on another companies copyright of the name) or plan to give away .NET now is it?  Besides you do pay for them (ping, tracert, telnet) as they are included in the OS.  I mean you guys love that, they give it away argument in favor of IE.  No you pay for it.  It's included in the price.  Netscape is free and so is Opera (ad version).

<BR><BR><b>And as has been mentioned many times, a legitimate ISP would never offer the kind of hacker services you mention.</b>

 gives away free tools does not "destroy" any
 argument. The choices made by those other 
 companies hardly determines anything about Micro-Soft.
   And this is not an argument, it is 
 a lecture.
<BR><BR>
You are deeply confused about Inter Net Explorer and
 those other tools.  Explorer is not given away, 
<i>it</i> is an integrated part of the Windows
 Operating System.  It would make no sense to 
charge separately for it, since you can't have 
 Windows without Inter Net Explorer.  Anyone who is a Windows Power
 User, as I am, can appreciate that.  Perhaps you
 are not familiar enough with the advanced 
features of Windows with Inter Net Explorer to 
 realize this.  
<BR><BR>
Now with those illegal terrorism tools, you have
 it exactly backwards.  They are <i>not</i> part
 of Windows at all -- if they were, why aren't
 they on  the Start Menu?  Clearly Micro-Soft
 does not wish its customers to have them; if they 
 did, <i>why aren't they on the Start Menu where
 they would belong?</i>  Granted, removing them
 from the Start Menu turned out to be poor 
 security (I was as surprised by this as anyone, 
 by the way, so I don't blame Micro-Soft for the 
 mistake), but less-than-perfect security is not
 at all the same as an invitation.  You are like
 a rapist who uses the "mini-skirt defense".
<BR><BR>
I'm beginning to see that those who are obsessed
 with attacking this software company Micro-Soft
 for all the problems in their lives just don't
 have a very good grasp of how Windows is used.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

By the way, since when was it illegal to look at what your browser sees?  I like the term "licenced legal HTTP renderer".  That's quite funny.  Escpecially because upon inspection the phrase doesn't make any sense.
<BR>

<BR>
"licenced":  Ok, since when did you have to license software based on RFC manuals?  Give you a hint: you dont.
<BR>

<BR>
"legal": Currently the only sort of software that is deemed illegal is that which is specifically designed to circumvent security measures.  telnet does not do any circumventing.  What telnet is meant to do is connect you to a telnet server for things such as remote administration of a website after proper authorization.
<BR>

<BR>
"HTTP": yah.  a browser doesn't render HTTP.  it transports and recieves data over it.  What a browser renders is HTML, which is a language rather than a protocol.
<BR>

<BR>
"renderer": hmm? are you talking about 3d graphics?  While the term is technically valid, for documents, an interpreter usually called a viewer.

<BR>
Lastly: did you see me issuing any commands to the SMTP port other than "QUIT"?  no.  In order to send e-mail, I have to issue the following command sequence:
<BR>

<BR>
HELO server
<BR>
MAiL FROM: source@email.bla
<BR>
RCPT TO: dest@email.bla
<BR>
DATA
<BR>
[header]
<BR>

<BR>
[message]
<BR>
.
<BR>
QUIT
<BR>

<BR>
Furthermore, since I don't have an e-mail account with adequacy.org, their SMTP server is useless for spam.  External mailing is usually blocked to outsiders (I haven't bothered to check, myself), and thus I'd have to send to people @ adequacy.org.  
<BR>

<BR>
The problem there is that to open, read, and delete a piece of SPAM, you actually have to have a brain.  So far as I've found, none of the people at adequacy are so endowed.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, by the way, you think my activities are illegal?  You have my IP address.  See if you can prosecute.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Your comment reveals only that you were stupid enough to not actually look before going through the red light if you can afford to go. The red light laws aren't worth of respect. The moving cars are. When you have clear vision of enough of the road on all the sides, and there is no car there approaching, the red light is irrelevant. When there is no visibility, it becomes a worthy indicator of safe pass.
<BR><BR>
Taking laws as irrelevant and taking the Reality as a guideline set instead is the only way how to cope in today's society with too many laws. Can you name even a tenth of them? No? How can you be expected to respect and follow all of them then?

Possibly, but you have to carefully weigh risks and losses.

I don't drive myself. But I do electrical installations (which I by law don't have papers to do - which I consider irrelevant as long as I keep all the insulation distances and other parameters at least what they should be), I use radio frequencies (when there isn't anything you can interfere with within the transmitter range you can transmit as you want, similarly what harm you can do when you listen on a "forbidden" band), I play with the computers (what harm you can do when you decompile and read "forbidden" code and learn one more trick), I do many more such things for both fun and profit... As far nobody ever complained and many came for more.

Here's some more history for you. Terry Welch invented <a href="http://www.unisys.com/unisys/lzw/">a variant</a> of the Lempel-Ziv compression method to allow compression in high-speed disk controllers. AT&T used this algorithm to write the "compress" / "uncompress" commands for UNIX SVR4. These replaced the previous pack / unpack / pcat commands which simply used Huffman coding.
<br><br>
Thom Henderson took the source of "compress", came up with an archiving file format, and released his ARC program as shareware for the MS-DOS operating system.

<br><br>
Phil Katz took the source of ARC and re-wrote the compression and decompression routines in assembler. He released PKARC / PKXARC from this. Thom (trading as System Enhancement Associates) was happy about this until Phil released PKARC commercially and advertised the product with disparaging comparisons to ARC. SEA sued PKWARE for copyright infringement. They settled something or other out of court. Phil somehow commanded the respect of the BBS community, because the evil giant megacorp SEA (employees: Thom and his wife) sued the innocent plagiarist dirty-trickster alcoholic loner Katz.
<br><br>
Phil then wrote PKPAK, then PKZIP. He placed the ZIP name, file format, and compression algorithm in the public domain. Sysops converted their ARC archives to ZIP archives en-masse.
<br><br>
However, so far PKZIP only existed for MS-DOS. The Info-ZIP team formed to make a portable ZIP archiver.
<br><br>
Seeing a need to offer generalised compression to programmers, Adler and Gailly extracted the deflate/inflate routines from Info-ZIP's work, and created the infamous <a href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib/">zlib</a> library.
<br><br>
Later still, Stallman et al realised they needed a compress(1) knockoff for their GNU UNIX-replacement, but they couldn't just use compress(1) because it used the patent-encumbered LZW algorithm. Gailly offered zlib, and they came up with a <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt">simple, standard format</a> around that compression routine to produce gzip, GNU's version of compress(1).
<br><br>
So basically, there is <a href="http://www.dogma.net/DataCompression/Zip.shtml">lots of software</a>, commercial and non-commercial, that uses the public domain ZIP standards. Any "competing" they do is not in any way related to the basic ZIP file format or deflate algorithm that they rely upon, which are also the only things that link them all together.

have you ever tryed opening up a dos box in windows and type ping.  Yeah it has ping.  I work at an isp and i use ping all the time.  And its not for hacking.  It tells me if can even get out on a connection.  Yeah it helps fix things.  Stop the press on that one.  And ssh,  some of you people have no consept of what anything even is,  have you ever been to the OpenSSH webpage to find out what it is.  It is a secure telnet client to KEEP HACKERS OUT.  or maybe that blew by a few of you.  I use it so that i can remotly run all of my BSD servers at home, and we use it internally so we can (here is that keyword again) FIX THINGS.  As for xemacs i dont use it i prefer vi.  But they are text editors.  Nothing bad about that.  Do you guys freak out when someone uses notepad.  And yes IIS sucks<BR><BR></FONT></td>
