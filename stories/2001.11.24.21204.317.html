		So you say you're a little upset with Global Industrial Capitalism.  Perhaps some aspect or other of the whole thing makes you feel a bit guilty about your shiny new car.  Perhaps it has driven you off into <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/ari_home.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/">indefensible</a>
<a href="http://www.libertarian.org/">philosophical</a> <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/marx.html">cul-de-sac</a>, and you find yourself getting into too many arguments with strangers in bars.  You might even be hopping mad, and feel like you might smash up your local coffee chain-outlet at the slightest provocation.

Relax.  Help is on the way.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Here is what you need to do:  
<p>
Grin and ignore it.
<p>
Global Industrial Capitalism can't stand being ignored.  And it absolutely <i>hates</i> being ignored by a smiling person.  You may need to practice both parts of this strategy.  Many people who have trouble with Global Industrial Capitalism also have a hard time smiling.  A little practice with a mirror will be sufficient for some; see how good you look when you're smiling?  Damn!  Now Global Industrial Capitalism is being ignored by a <i>sexy</i> person.  It will be positively <i>livid</i>, I tell you!  Others may need a bit of help, so go sneak into a showing of <i>Monsters, Inc</i> or <i>Am�lie</i>.  If you don't want to sneak in, try to wheedle a ticket out of an usher, or mooch off of a wealthier friend.  It is important that you not pay for the film, because this is the other prong of the strategy; this is the active <i>ignoring</i> of Global Industrial Capitalism.
<p>
There are thousands of ways to ignore Global Industrial Capitalism.  Try starting small; skip a credit card payment, pay your rent a few days late, or steal a newspaper.  Now have a look at yourself.  Are you feeling guilty for stealing that newspaper?  Stop it.  This is exactly what Global Industrial Capitalism wants.  It also wants you to worry about your credit rating and possible eviction notices.  Cut it out.  You don't need to worry about those things.  What are you going to do with your credit rating, after all?  Buy a shiny new car?  You don't need a new car, damn it.  Look in the mirror again.  See that smile?  Happy, sexy people don't need shiny new cars.  If your old car breaks, you can be happy without one.  Happy people can be happy on the bus, or on a bicycle, or on foot.  The added exercise will help keep you happy <i>and</i> sexy.  Now stop worrying about eviction.  You can sleep on your friend's couch for a while, and then find another apartment.  Or you can just live in a tent for a while.  Your friends or parents will hold on to your stuff for the summer.
<p>
Now, you don't actually have to go and get yourself evicted or default on your debt.  What you do need to do is realize that it doesn't really matter much if these things happen.  You'll be fine.  People will take care of you, and there is plenty of exciting life to be had outside of your current routine.  However.
<p>
You may need to closely examine your current routine, and ferret out any part of it that is contributing to your difficulties with Global Industrial Capitalism.  Is your job a big part of your identity?  Trouble!  Start slacking off at work immediately.  Stop investing your sense of self-worth in the sort of drudgery that keeps Global Industrial Capitalism smug and satisfied.  This may be difficult.  You might be afraid of being fired for slacking off.  This, of course, is exactly what Global Industrial Capitalism wants you to feel.  Get over it.  You can find another job.  In fact, a change of career might be just the ticket to establishing a sense of identity entirely independent of your profession.  Don't worry about ending up with a crappier job than the one you have now.  After all, you might just as easily wind up doing much more rewarding work.  And if the next job is unpleasant, then it will be that much easier to slack off.  Let's face it: apart from a few people who dig trenches or monitor nuclear reactors, the entire "economy" is just a game, a whimsical shuffling of social position, a ploy for attention on the part of Global Industrial Capitalism.  Take stuff from work.  Show up late to meetings.  Loiter.  Start coming in at ten and leaving at four thirty.  Take an hour and a half for lunch.  Smile!  It's only a job.  You could get a couple more tomorrow if you had to.
<p>
Now you may be afraid that ignoring Global Industrial Capitalism might impair your ability to procure a spouse or potential spouse, and this particular fear is Global Industrial Capitalism's favorite thing in the whole world.  Remember:  Grin.  Grinning is sexy, and grinning is anathema to Global Industrial Capitalism.
<p>
Now.  It is time to act.
<p>
Go to your local Clean, Healthy Tavern.  Sit down at the bar.  Order a drink.  Grin.  Talk to the person next to you about the New York Yankees, Manchester United, or your cat.  Make jokes about Marxists, or talk about rocks.  Talk about anything at all, as long as you keep grinning.  Notice how people grin back?  They don't really care what you're talking about, but neither do you.  You are grinning at each other like loons only because grinning is self-reinforcing, just like Depression.  Unlike Depression, grinning is also contagious.  It is part of the way your monkey-brain is wired up.  You can't help it.  Go to your Clean, Healthy Tavern every night.  Keep talking to strangers until they become acquaintances.  When several people greet you by name and grin as you enter and sit down at the bar, you are ready to deliver the fatal blow.  Go in one night <i>without any money</i>.  Explain to everyone that you have forgotten your wallet, or are flat broke until payday.  Grin.  People will buy you drinks.  The bartender will <i>give</i> you drinks.  You will go home drunk and happy, perhaps with a grinning  potential spouse.
<p>
You have done it.  You have defeated Global Industrial Capitalism, without leaving your bar-stool.      <br><br></div>

The drug companies will become richer in the short-term, but the economy as a whole becomes poorer. If, by an arbitrary date, we take this to the extent that 99% of the population might be living off the state in this way, the only income for the pharmaceuticals will be from the government which will have got it's money from taxing them. since there are costs involved in producing the goods, and the goverment needs to keep some of its tax income for itself, this loop will involve smaller and smaller amounts of money until nothing at all in a very short time. the drugs companies will shut down US operations and concentrate on abroad.
<BR>

<BR>
this will gently lead to the majority of the population having no money (or drugs anymore) and living in a money-free ('poor') environment :) we would have to teach our children of capitalism to make sure they don't fall into the trap of working for multinational factories being built in America, when instead we can be self-supporting and happy.
<BR>

<BR>
we won't get 99% of the population to do this, but every person who does delivers a strong blow to capitalism.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Global Industrial Capitalism <i>loathes</i> <a href="http://www.simpleliving.net/web_of_simplicity/the_movement.asp">Voluntary Simplicity</a>.  Henry David Thoreau, often thought of as the "founder" of Voluntary Simplicity, said it best:  "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but are positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have even lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor."  In your strategy, the wise seem to achieve this by honing their ability to cadge drinks -- it's an elegant approach.<BR><BR>

Another powerful weapon against the GIC is living debt-free.  Even if you achieve the state of grinning bliss, GIC still has the last laugh if you're carrying credit card debt (<i>I owe, I owe -- It's off to work I go...</i>).<BR><BR>

Some folks even advocate that its our love affair with <a href="http://www.life.ca/nl/40/gatto.html"><i>machines</i></a> that has enslaved us into the service of GIC, to wit:  "It surprises me how many graduates leave college assuming they know what matters because they got straight 'A's. If we can believe advertisements, what matters to these people most is the personal ownership of machinery: blending machines, cooking machines, driving machines, picture machines, sound machines, tooth-brushing machines, computing machines, machines to kill insects, deliver intimacy, send messages through wires or the naked air, entertainment machines, shooting machines, and many more mechanical extensions of our physical self. Indirect control over even more ambitious machine seems to matter a lot, too: flying machines, bombing machines, heart and lung machines, voting machines, and a great variety of other mechanical creations.<BR><BR>

"All these devices are meant to defeat what otherwise would occur naturally if they didn't exist. They are all machines to beat human destiny and confer on human beings magical powers and the reach and longevity of gods.<BR><BR>

"Do they deliver what they promise? Is human life in a net sense better since their advent? I can't answer that for you, of course, but you can look into your heart and answer the question for yourself. Someone has apparently convinced us that what occurs naturally cannot be the way to a good life, hence these battalions of machinery. What percentage of your life is spent talking to machines? Buying them, mastering them, ministering to their needs, then betraying them with ever newer and newer machine loves?"<BR><BR>

In a follow-up <a href="http://www.life.ca/nl/41/gatto.html">article</a>, the author reaffirms with greater specificity the connection between the global economy and the machines we use: "It's easy to see how a global economy would matter to the spirit of mass-production machinery or to international banking, with all the urgencies of those twin mechanisms. But it's not clear what the point of it is for flesh and blood.<BR><BR>

"<b>What if you forgot all about the globe and concentrated instead on finding a place where you could feel at home for the rest of your life? What if you shaped your own work so that it served your spirit and the spirits of your loved ones, friends and neighbors?</b> In 1776 a full 90 percent of Americans not in slavery shaped their own work. They had independent livelihoods. And in 1840, despite the rise of industrialization, the figure was still 80 percent. It was hard then for any man to get rich on the labours of others because there wasn't much free-floating labour to be had; people worked for themselves. That -- liberty and independence, not wealth or comfort -- was the American miracle.<BR><BR>
"You know, machines can be stored anywhere, can function anywhere, and are indifferent to other machines they must associate with. But men and women have to build the meanings of their lives around a few -- a very few -- people to touch and love and care for. If you're always getting rid of people, trading them off the way you've been taught to trade off things, you can't have much of a life. And if you fail in this vital endeavor of linking up with the right people for you, it doesn't matter at all how healthy the space program is or how many machines you own. You'll still be lonely in the middle of crowds."<BR><BR>

It would seem, therefore, that in addition to turning off the idiot box, turning off  one's PC would also pose a threat to Global Industrial Capitalism's omnipresence and dominance... It's a seductive thought.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
The problem with the Neo-Puritan suburban "movement" that you call Voluntary Simplicity is that its proponents are so insufferably self-righteous.  They rank right up there with people who don't watch or own a television, and want you to be very aware of the fact.  
<BR><BR>
Television is fun.  Sitting on your sofa all day, watching television and drinking instead of going somewhere in your shiny new car and "working," can make Global Industrial Capitalism <i>very</i> nervous.  Best of all, television is the best opportunity you have to <i>laugh at</i> Global Industrial Captialism, as it compulsively airs its anxieties in the little vignettes known as "commercials" or "advertisments."
<BR><BR>
Devout neo-puritan practitioners of "Voluntary Simplicity" are functionally equivalent to Freedom Soft-Ware zealots.  These people are largely reactionary, self-hating bigots who deny themselves an easier and more pleasant way of life, and then get bitter and, paradoxically, self-congratulatory when normal people reject their painfully narrow world views, and then they blame everything on the father-totem (all due credit to elenchos, by the by).
<BR><BR>
The unclean people known as "hippies," in the course of destroying their remaining brain cells, at least break away from this sort of mindset from time to time through the ritual abuse of hallucinogens, but then they go and get all self-righteous about their drug abuse and unkempt hair.
<BR><BR>
Conversely, there's nothing self-righteous about a drunk trying to wheedle a free drink.  The drunk is pretty pathetic, and the drunk knows it.  But the drunk is happy, and the drunk is ignoring Global Industrial Capitalism.  Same effect as the Voluntary Simplicity, you see, but much better company.
<BR><BR>
The cry for debt-free living is another red herring.  Global Industrial Capitalism wants you to want to live debt free, to sweat and frown and slave away to pay off that last, stubborn bit of debt.  If you ignore the fear that Global Industrial Capitalism wants you to feel, you can have an absolute blast by building up a debt, and then you can pile on more and more until you die or someone declares you bankrupt (at which point you can just start building up more debt).  Debt is good.  Love your debt.  Brag about it, even, if you like.
<BR><BR>
Now then.
<BR><BR>
If you really think Voluntary Simplicity is the way to go, then I suggest you start looking into subsistence farming.  If you don't have the bling-bling for forty acres and a beast of burden, or if you don't have a spouse with whom you can build a large labor pool, then there are lots of subsistence-farming communities out there upon whose collective mercy you might throw yourself.  There might be a bit of Religion or Indefensible Philosophical Claptrap to be swallowed in exchange, and you may be expected to contribute to the labor pool, but if you just keep your eyes on the prize, then everything should work out fine.  
<BR><BR>
But.

Don't think Global Industrial Capitalism will give a damn.  Global Industrial Capitalism is pretty good at just ignoring subsistence farmers, and carrying on with its Oppression of the Proletariat and the like, as if the subsistence farmers didn't exist at all.<BR><BR><BR>

I'd prefer my epitaph to read as such:  "Here was a great woman; a magnificent, generous, gallant, reckless, fated fool of a woman. There was never a place for her in the ranks of the terrible, slow army of the cautious. She ran ahead, where there were no paths."  (Dorothy Parker, writing about Isadora Duncan)<BR><BR>
Be that as it may, I would suggest that there's a vast world of difference between the Gap-clad Yuppie fucks who evangelize Voluntary Simplicity from a pedestal of smugness and those who aspire instead to emulate Thoreau.  I have little doubt that Thoreau would have admired your advocacy of a "drunk trying to wheedle a free drink" as wholly in keeping with the notion of surviving by one's wits.  And perhaps he'd even consider the action as a form of <i>barter</i> which would defeat Global Industrial Capitalism simply by the fact that there's often little of value in mere <i>conversation</i> which can serve to add to its corpulence.<BR><BR>
Subsistence farming?  Not my cuppa joe, really.  Emulating the gypsy lifestyle of my ancestors would be a more plausible means of defeating Global Industrial Capitalism and would, dare I say it, turn your theoretical "drunk" into a full-blown existence without the restrictions of a limited context.<BR><BR>
Me, I just want the last check I write to bounce.  Perhaps that's not as dramatic as what you propose, but it's enough.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I'd like to propose another, possibly more subtle, way of subverting GIC. We should all buy stuff that we need and enjoy, but fix that stuff when some part of it breaks or needs replacing. Rather than throwing away those work boots, have them re-soled. This drives the GIC crazy, because they spend billions of dollars (pounds/yen/DM/etc.) per year on advertising hysterically trying to get us to buy new stuff because somehow old stuff is faulty, or can't do what the new stuff can, or is just "not cool" anymore. And, as a bonus, you can drink while you're re-soling your boots or fixing your TV - they tend to frown on that in malls and department stores.

As far as emulating Thoreau, though, I think I have to pass. Whenever he got hungry out there in the woods at Walden, he just swung over to Mom's house in Concord to get some food. Since my mother lives 500 miles away, it just ain't that easy to mooch off her anymore.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
