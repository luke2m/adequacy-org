<BR><BR>I found quite a number of links.  Some include sources like PC Magazine.  Some of the links even include pictures of the original Microsoft logo and Windows boxes.

<BR><BR><b>NOTE:</b>  Some of the sources mention Xenix.  Please do not be one of these tards who runs around posting that MS originally wrote Unix or that Unix is based on Xenix.  Here's the story on Xenix:

<blockquote><i>Based on Unix System III, Microsoft's Xenix (companies that licensed Unix from Bell Labs weren't allowed to call it Unix, so Microsoft came up with the name "Xenix") ran on the IBM PC/XT and didn't come with TCP/IP or any of the networking software we've come to expect with Unix systems. Microsoft didn't even sell to end users. Instead, it licensed Xenix to companies such as SCO, Tandy, and Intel, who turned around and sold a branded Xenix to users. Alas, by the mid-1980s, Microsoft quit the Unix business to concentrate full time on DOS and Windows. Microsoft never even released a version of Xenix for the Intel 80286 processor.</i></blockquote>

Now for the links about Windows/286 and Windows/386.  Also remember that Windows was not originally an operating system.  It was an "Operating Environment" or a software suite which ran under DOS however you want to word it.

<blockquote>"In just the two weeks since the global launch of Windows XP, Microsoft has already sold an amazing 7 million copies of Windows XP, which we are incredibly excited about," Gates said, referring to the total number of copies sold to computer makers and at retail. "We believe that Windows XP, along with exciting new technologies such as the Tablet PC, Xbox, Microsoft .NET Servers and XML Web services, will light a fire of innovation across the entire high-technology industry."</blockquote>

<b>Watch that 7 million carefully, and now watch it disappear.</b>

<blockquote>"With all the uncertainty, we weren't sure what the sales would be like, what the OEM sales would be like, what the retail sales would be like. Now, two weeks later, we have that data. Our OEM sales are far beyond any new product we've ever had. Our retail sales are more than double any version of Windows or, of course, any software product that's ever been released."</blockquote>

<b>Want more?</b>

<blockquote>"Since its retail debut Oct. 25, Microsoft Corp.'s newest operating system, Windows XP, is achieving high demand worldwide. So high that some retailers are having trouble keeping store shelves stocked with Windows XP. Growing consumer demand for Windows XP has led to sales that are exceeding initial sales of Windows 95 and Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) and keeping pace with initial sales of Windows 98." - Microsoft, 8th November 2001.</blockquote>

<b>Exceeding? Keeping pace with? But three days later didn't Bill say "more than double"?</b>

<BR><BR>Microsoft is counting the sales to PC manufacturers and retail stores.  The number of PCs pre-loaded with XP and retail boxes is much much lower.  How many of the 7 million units are still sitting on store shelves?

Windows2000 does not always work with the hardware MS claims it does (according to their HCL).  A lot of people are very please with Linux and a lot of people see it the same way as you do.
<BR>

<BR>
It's perfectly ok to voice your opinion on a product.  But simply to state the old "I'm smart so its true because I say so adequacy bullshit"  is just plain silly.
<BR>

<BR>
I myself have never had a major problem with Linux.  Well I did but it was with Linux.  I was backing up some files to a Linux system used primarily for back ups.  The WindowsXP system that was transmitting the data crapped out and everything was garbled.
<BR>

<BR>
People who are satisfied with certain software will continue to use it.  Despite what people think I am not completely biased.  If Windows works for you then you will continue to use it.  If not you find something, just as you would with any other software.  If Linux fulfills your needs you will continue to use it.
<BR>

<BR>
I usually suggest to people that want to try Linux to dual boot.  A number of them find they can do what they need in Linux, but keep Windows  for games and software which they don't like the Linux equivalent.  Some people use it, switch back and forth and such.  Others simply don't like it.
<BR>

<BR>
I know a number of people who have grown tired Windows 98.  It had collected quite a few bugs (bugs not viruses) was running slowly and they were tired of patching.  Windows 2000 or XP really would have solved their problem as they would need a pricey hardware purchase.  All they did was wor procesing, spread sheet, accounting (gnuCash).  For them Linux works well.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't have problems with Windows or Microsoft by all means continue to enjoy it.  I'm not saying everyone should switch to Linux.  It's not for everyone.  Niether is any Unix variant for that matter.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

I really find it rather disturbing that you are getting so obsessed over this.<BR><BR>
By the way, lesbians aren't generally considered attractive. Here are some simple, <i>scientific</i> facts about lesbians (this also applies to female bisexuals):<BR><BR>
<ul>
<li>Lesbians tend to be quite masculine. This is because the reason they are lesbians is an unusual excess of testosterone in their bloodstream. Contrary to popular belief, testosterone in a woman's bloodstream is a good thing, up to a point - it is the primary motivator behind the sex drive in both men and women. However, too high a level does of course tend to give a woman more masculine traits, and can even make her attracted to members of her own sex rather than the opposite! Also, by the way, testosterone in the female bloodstream is temporarily boosted by alchohol consumption - this is why many modern women have shockingly masculine appearances (dry, rough skin, excess of hair necessitating shaving, perhaps a small, but visible moustache - all hallmarks of the decadent 'party girl' used to her 50 units of alchohol a week).
<li> Lesbians are frequently mentally ill. A life spent with extreme gender confusion, rejecting the mores of society, those same mores that have kept our society together for many millenia, can create many tensions and confusions in the mind of the lesbian. Lesbians are generally schizophrenic.
<li> Lesbians are sexual gluttons (see my first point for <i>why</i>), but far worse than this, they reject the natural accompaniment to sex - <b>love</b>. We have all heard of Anthony and Cleopatra, Romeo and Juliet, and such tragic expressions of heterosexual love - where are the examples of tragic homosexual love? I do believe there are none, because lesbians are incapable of love. Indeed, I sometimes (in my more cynical moments) think that the female of the species is downright incapable of love as a man would understand it, but I can certainly be sure that lesbians are not. They are overcome by perverted basic urges, and rarely (if ever) think on a higher plane of sacrifice and spiritual, loving union with another.
</ul>
Now, please don't be too upset at me for saying this, I just thought that you should know why  men (and women!) reject you and your kind.<BR><BR>
If I were you, I would take drugs to suppress the production of testosterone in your body, read plenty of Shakespeare (to ignite selfless appreciation of others and open the way to love) and perhaps (one day) try having a real, spiritual (not in a religious sense, *wink*) union with a <b>Man</b>.<BR><BR>
Just trying to help, feel free to take or reject my advice as you see fit. Just bear in mind that I speak from experience.<BR><BR><BR>&hearts;, bc.<BR></FONT></td>

Good question.<BR><BR>
<i>What windowing system does it use?</i><BR><BR>
If you mean "does it have a graphical interface?", then the answer is "it doesn't". Everyone knows that Linux has no GUI and is run entirely from the command line.<BR><BR>
<i>What windows managers does it come with?</i><BR><BR>
Haven't you already asked this question?<BR><BR>
<i>I see the Deluxe Edition is only available through retail sale. What other versions of Executive Linux are available?</i><BR><BR>
Just the Deluxe Edition. No executive worth his salt should waste their time with anything less than finest quality deluxe versions of anything.<BR><BR>
<i>Where can I download the binaries/source?</i><BR><BR>
You can't download either. The binaries are shipped on a single compact disk in a mahogany box, and are thus not suitable for electronic delivery.<BR><BR>
<i>What boot loader is available with this distro?</i><BR><BR>
Mandrake Installer.<BR><BR>
<i>How much of this distro is under the GNU General Public License?</i><BR><BR>
None, Executive Linux (Deluxe Edition) is proprietary software, distributed exclusively by Adequacy.org.<BR><BR> 
<i>What organization develops this distro? Adequacy?</i><BR><BR>
Yes!<BR><BR>
<i>Why would I need a replacement computer?</i><BR><BR>
Adequacy.org cannot guarantee that Linux will not cause irreversible damage to your computer. Therefore, we include a free replacement computer as part of our Executive Linux (Deluxe Edition) package.<BR><BR>
<i>Executive Linux Deluxe Edition from Adequacy
The only Linux distro designed by people that don't know anything about [...] computers in general.</i><BR><BR>
And how does this make Exectuive Linux (Deluxe Edition) different to any other version of Linux?<BR><BR> 

Please send an email to any of the Adequacy staff if you are interested in purchasing a copy of Adequacy.org's Executive Linux (Deluxe Edition) or any other products from the Adequacy store, and we will arrange prompt delivery of your goods.

<BR><BR><b> If you mean "does it have a graphical interface?", then the answer is "it doesn't". Everyone knows that Linux has no GUI and is run entirely from the command line.</b>

<BR><BR>The question was what WINDOWING SYSTEM.  A more correct answer would be Xfree86.  Also Linux is a kernel.  There is no command line interface until you ad a command interpreter.  Same goes for the Windows kernels.

<BR><BR>Most executives don't know what linux is.  Executives doesn't mean they know anything about computers at all.  Also no one in there right might would ever purchase a linux distro without further information or the ability to launch a pilot program.

<BR><BR>Must not be that much of a distribution if it only comes on a single CD.  What services and software solutions does it come with?  Where's the source code?

<BR><BR><b>None, Executive Linux (Deluxe Edition) is proprietary software, distributed exclusively by Adequacy.org.</b>

<BR><BR>Two things.  I hope that it does not include any code under the GNU GPL.  Also Linus Torvalds holds the copyright on the name Linux.  You cannot legally call it linux and it cannot legal use the linux kernel nor any GPL licensed code.  Despite what you think Adequacy nor any other organization has the legal right to tranfer its copyright or license to an already copyrighted or licensed product.  Don't make make me point to one of my posts about where Adequacy has done this.  If so I will fire it off to the FBI's offices in charge of copyright infringement.

<BR><BR>Unlike Adequacy they do know a thing or two about computers.

<BR><BR><b>no one in there right might would ever purchase a linux distro</b>

<BR><BR>Yeah let's not put the entire sentence there now.  But your links are outdated and really make no sense.  VA Linux is now moving away from simply providing a home for open source developement.  Dell stop selling linux on its desktop because, at the time, linux desktops weren't as popular as they are now.  They still continued to sell server running linux.  Dell also issued a <a href="http://theregister.co.uk/content/archive/22928.html">formal</a> <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/biz/topics/linux_linuxhome.htm">apology</a> to the open source commnunity.  You can now request linux on Dell desktop systems.

<BR><BR>Eazel closed it's doors because it didn't have a solid business plan and the popularity of linux on the desktop was not there yet.  Also SuSE has been kicked around quite a bit by the popularity of Red Hat just like other linux companies.  I think that if you put that research to good use you'll find that SuSE is doing rather well now, mostly because of their new partnership programs.

<BR><BR><b>So sue me.</b>

<BR><BR>Don't worry about me.  Worry about the Free Software Foundation.  Worry about Linus Torvalds who owns the trademark for the name (Linux) and leads kernel development.  Also worry about MandrakeSoft for using the Mandrake Installer.

<BR><BR><b>Congratulations! You've just lost your valuable data! Now, don't you wish you'd installed Executive Linux (Deluxe Edition) on the nice new computer we supply free of charge with every copy?</b>

<BR><BR>First off what does a replacement computer have to do with recoversing my data?  Why couldn't I simply use the computer I already had if I wanted to install another OS?  Also I am less likely to lose data under a Linux based OS because I don't have to worry about Internet Explorer and Outlook Express exploits for example.  Not to mention that just like any network professional I would have backed everything up locally and offsite just as I would with any other OS.

<BR><BR>You still have yet to explain the need for a complete replacement computer.  How does linux screw up a system that I would need an enitrely new computer?  Data loss does justify new hardware purchases.  Many times it does not justify a complete software change either.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

<BR><BR>Maybe you loose more data with propriatory software because you use it more? Maybe because you use it less and so are not as experienced with it? Are you so arrogant as to believe that because you can install a linux distribution then configuring windows to be stable must be easy? Of course, the language and tone of your post show your complete lack of technical acumen. That you think a problem with firewalls <b>running on</b> WinXP is a serious security problem shows your inexperience in matters of computer security. WinXP is new, AFAIK MS is not telling  bussiness to move over from 2k to XP for server/gateway duties which is the only role this hole would really affect, although obviously personal firewalls products are also affected but for the most part personal firewalls really are not neccessary on home windows systems.
<BR><BR>In short I think your just full of shit. Especially on that entire thread about the GPL being tested in court. Why do big companies make out of court settlements*1 when they probably could stand a chance of steamrollering the GPL in court? PR.

It is trivial to write licenses which arent enforceable. The GPL may be one of them. Not even RMS can tell you differently until such time as it passes the test of court, an exercise the FSF has assiduously avoided. Now you may ask yourself why hasnt the FSF tested its license? After all, a postive court outcome would completely legitimize the license and erase all lingering doubts of its enforceability. But you'd have to smart to raise this question, instead of filled with false certainty for the FSF party line. (It  <i>seems</i> perfectly valid but then again, who would have thought the Court would ever appoint the United States President? Law is a funny, reactionary thing.)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If a single lawyer was to start unilaterally deciding the law without first taking things through the proper channels (e.g. the courts), I'm sure you and the rest of Linux "community" would be the first to be up in arms about it. Why is this case any different? The truth is that he doesn't know if the GPL is enforceable, <b>no-one does</b>. Until the GPL has been successfully tested in court, no-one can guarantee that it's enforceable.<BR><BR>
At least try to develop some sort of ability to analyse what you read, so that you can decided whether people are speaking the truth or not. Realise that things are rarely black and white and that <i>everyone</i> has their own agenda. Realise that the open source "community" are just as capable of lieing and deceiving as your favourite manufacturers of proprietary software.<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>It doesn't matter what camp you are from.  It's human nature.  The simple truth however, is that many a times incidents involving the GNU GPL don't go to court because many developers believe it means they will have to make the product open source.

<BR><BR>The GNU GPL is not the only copyright/license/trademark or what not to be defeated in certain cases.  The example I gave in a previous post is a good.  Microsoft feels she did wrong.  That's just stupid.  If I sell someone pirated software, but don't tell them it's pirated and they install it...should they go to jail?

<BR><BR>Adobe got caught up in this.  A software vendor was purchasing Adobe softwre bundles then selling of the indivdual pieces.  Adobe claimed he was breaking the law.  A federal judge said otherwise.

<BR><BR>Microsoft is now is disputes over a linux startup set to release a distro called Lindows (because it runs Linux software and most Windows-based software).  MS has been throwing fits for awhile now,  Does that mean their trademark, or their copyright isn't worth the paper it's printed on?  No.  It's funny, they never said anything about WinLinux2000.

<BR><BR>Basically every license, trademark, or copyright <i>can</i> be defeated under certain conditions.  It doesn't mean that the GPL or otherwise is shit.  Most companies adhere to it.  If someone violates it, they try to correct it.  Either that or they look for any tiny loophole they can exploit.

<BR><BR>In most cases it's not a violation of whatever copyright, license, or trademark.  What it comes down to is a bunch of lawyers slamming their dicks on the table to see who's bigger.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

Microsoft, as an example, is not always involved.  MS has a history of going after the wrong person.

One example (I will try to find the link) is with a woman who owned a software shop.  Her distributor had sold here illegal copies of Windows.  She was not aware of this, as they were GOOD copies.  Microsoft tried to sue her.  She on the other hand proved her case and sued MS.

Many times distributors violate copyright laws.  Sometimes their clients notice it and report them to organizations like the FBI.

<i>[The FSF] does not enforce the GNU GPL. It is more of a watchdog.</i>
<BR><BR>
For the record, the FSF encourages programmers to assign their copyright to the FSF as a legal strategy. Their thinking is that individual programmers do not have the wherewithal to protect their IP but the FSF does. We <i>already</i> know the FSF's legal protection amounts to shrill yelping instead of courtroom argument; that was posted several comments ago by at least 3 different people.

<li>Eazel shuts its doors. Why? Because there isn't a sufficient Linux user base who are willing to pay for software.<BR><BR></ol>
Make all the excuses for these <b>facts</b> that you like, you're clearly a dedicated Linux apologist and there's no way I'm ever going to convince you otherwise. But let me make this clear: Linux is not the revolution. It has had plenty of time to take the world by storm and Linux's moment has <i>always</i> been "just around the corner". If Linux was going to "happen", it surely would have done to some noticeable extent by now. Linux will never achieve mainstream acceptability.
