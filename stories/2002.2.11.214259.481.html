		<B>[editor's note, by Peter Johnson] </B>The <a href="../users/40/index.html">poets</a>,
<a href="../users/270/index.html">artists</a>,
<a href="../users/16/index.html">financiers</a> and
<a href="../users/45/index.html">philosopher kings</a> (of
<a href="../users/746/index.html">either gender</a>)
who make up the
editorial staff of <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> and comprise its
<a href="../users/510/index.html">most
valued users</a> are often accused of failing to contribute to the technical community that has
made them so very wealthy, universally respected and critically acclaimed.  Like all
of <a href="http://inadequacy.org">our detractors</a>, the individuals who make these
claims are <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">completely and utterly wrong</a>.&nbsp
We at <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> are tireless in our efforts to
enlighten and elevate the <a href="http://slashdot.org">pathetic computer geeks</a>
whose labor we have employed in gaining our present status as
<a href="../users/783/index.html">captains of industry</a>.

<p>Thus it is with great pride that we introduce our latest triumph of
<a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/">philanthropy</a>, a certification designed
to improve the lot of the
<a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/community/scrapbook/seattlemeet030201/ufie1_20.jpg">average
IT professional</a>.&nbsp; While some might argue that
this is not true philanthropy, as we will undoubtedly <a href="../../special/adequacy%20shop.html">profit
handsomely</a> from the sale of training materials and exam fees, we are
certain that once you see the benefits to be realized by obtaining this
certification you will dismiss any such arguments as being truly absurd.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><b><i>The value of technical certification is undeniable.&nbsp; </i></b>Certifications
validate your skills and areas of competency for prospective employers.
Once you've successfully completed the training you need, you must have
a way to prove your newly minted expertise.&nbsp; The
process of certification provides you with a set of credentials that are
recognized worldwide.&nbsp; Wherever you go, certifications by companies like
Microsoft, Oracle and Sun are recognized and accepted.
<p><b><i>Certifications enhance your personal economic potency.&nbsp;</i></b>
In recent years it has been widely reported that certified computer industry
professionals make 20% more on average than non-certified professionals
who possess an identical skills set.&nbsp; If you have the knowledge, capabilities
and aptitude, why not ensure that you're eligible for the highest level
of compensation possible?
<p><b><i>Record numbers of technical professionals are pursuing certification
to become more competitive in an ever-shrinking high tech job market.</i></b>
Even though the number of certified technical professionals
has grown exponentially, the demand has grown at least as fast as, if not
faster than, the number of genuinely certifiable people.
<p><b><i>Whether you are just getting started or are ready to move ahead
in the computer industry, the knowledge and skills you develop are your
most valuable assets.</i></b> Enhancing your technical expertise and skills
resources should be an ongoing component of your career plan -- think of it
as an insurance policy that will enable you to thrive regardless of
economic fluctuations that may occur.
<p>In keeping with the demand for new ways to demonstrate one's professional
growth within the IT industry, it is with great pride that <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a>
unveils a revolutionary certification tract with an astonishingly high
degree of value: <b><font size=+1>The LIFE Infrastructure Fundamentals
Engineering</font><sup>TM</sup></b> certification for technical professionals.
<p><b><i>LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> is a different kind of
professional certification.</i></b> While other certifications attempt
to enhance your expertise with regard to the technical aspects of your
job, becoming LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certified will enhance
all of your waking hours.&nbsp; Even after you leave work in the evening or if, heaven
forbid, you should actually lose your job, LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
will continue to work <i>for you</i>.&nbsp; In today's ever-changing high
tech marketplace, the versatile skills set we will impart through our comprehensive
training program will ensure that the benefits of getting a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
are truly never-ending.
<p><i><b>LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> is hard.</b></i>
Pursuing your LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification is a
serious challenge.&nbsp; The exams cover a wide range of topics that require
dedicated study and a conscious effort to develop expertise.&nbsp; The vast majority
of those who have successfully achieved other computer industry credentials
will likely experience difficulty in attaining the status of becoming LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>-certified.
Indeed, one's ability to obtain LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification often seems inversely proportional to the number of previous
certifications one has attained.&nbsp; If getting a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
were easier, the market would quickly be flooded and the certification
would become meaningless.&nbsp; In recognition of this fact, steps have been
taken to ensure that the LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
means its holder is truly knowledgeable and skilled -- that he or she is,
in fact, worthy of having a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>.
<p><i><b>LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> is worthwhile.</b></i>
The benefits of becoming LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certified
are numerous, perhaps even exponential! Your skin will begin synthesizing
vitamin D, you'll have sex more often and with more desirable partners,
you'll look better and feel better, you'll have more energy and enthusiasm, people will
stop avoiding you and may even begin to <i>seek out</i> your company for
non-work-related contact, your boss will stop calling you "Stinky, the pudgy server-monkey,"
and may even feel compelled to give you a raise!  There's no telling just what
you might achieve if you were to get a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>.
<h2>
Are <i>you</i> qualified to have a LIFE<sup><font size=+0>TM</font></sup>?</h2>
To become LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certified, you must pass
rigorous exams covering four core requirements and three additional
elective categories demonstrating enhanced specialization as outlined below.
<p><b>Core Personal Exams (two required)</b>
<br>Candidates must pass two exams relating to the care and maintenance
of one's own physical form.

LIFE Certification FAQ</h2>
<b>Q:&nbsp; </b>How do I sign up for LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification training and exams?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>Contact your <a href="mailto:chloedancer@bitchwhorulesyourworld.com">Adequacy.org
training representative</a> for course pricing and schedule information.
Serious inquiries only, please.
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; It appears that the LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification is targeted exclusively to male technology professionals;
is this an accurate perception?
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; In a word:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; While it is recognized that
there are, in fact, a select few women holding positions of professional
responsibility in the high tech industry, Adequacy.org discovered that
regular bathing, socialization capability and snazzy dressing skills are
generally displayed amongst female information technology professionals
to a sufficient degree of accomplishment.&nbsp; As a result, this adequately-skilled
population is decidedly a poor target market for LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification.&nbsp; Adequacy.org's exhaustive research of the potential
female market did reveal, however, that a separate certification tract
should be developed in the future to address the complex, varied and specific
issues faced by female professionals in the high tech marketplace.&nbsp;  Reaction to the

beta test of <b><i>Exam 21-0018:</i></b>&nbsp; <i>Designing and Implementing
a Discouragement Strategy Utilizing Pepper Spray</i> has been overwhelmingly positive
and we hope to synergistically productise this proactive strategy in a win-win scenario.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Are there self-study options available or are candidates
required to attend Adequacy.org's LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification training program?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>While attendance at Adequacy.org's training and preparation
sessions is not required in order to sit for an exam, we believe that our
dedicated, professional staff, certified training materials and patented
electro-feedback educational/disciplinary technology is the best method
of preparing for the exams.&nbsp; Additionally, while self-study is not prohibited,
potential LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> candidates should realize
that much of the material covered by the exams requires group interaction.&nbsp;
Finally, it should be noted that course materials are not now and will
<i>never</i> be made available in any virtual format.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Will I be required to go outside to get my LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>Yes, in fact leaving your apartment and/or your corporate
turf is one of the core requirements for LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
Certification.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Are you sure that's safe? After all, "Where the warg
howls, the orc prowls."
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>Perhaps LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
isn't for you.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Will moving beyond my technically-obsessed geek identity
by attaining my LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification reduce
me to being nothing more than a nerd?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>Nerds are individuals lacking in sociality.&nbsp; Geeks are
deficient in mainstream social skills.&nbsp; Nerds are less disturbed by their
inferior social qualities; they are so consumed by their own particular
subject of interest that they care not what the world thinks of them.&nbsp; Simply
put, nerds are more fanatical.&nbsp; Geeks are social with others of their own
kind and quite often would like to have use of the social skills beyond
their limited capabilities, but far too frequently find themselves unable
to do so.&nbsp; The core competencies of the LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification have been specifically designed to address these deficits,
fundamentally expanding the geek's repertoire of capabilities beyond anything
that could remotely be described as "nerdish."
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Won't LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
make me associate with lusers and lamers and other people ESR assures me
are inferior?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>Yes, but please realize that, in the grand scheme of
things, this remains infinitely preferable to associating with ESR himself.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Why is LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
of value to me as a technical professional?
<p><b>A:</b> The most important objective of LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification is to empower you to enhance certain aspects of your wetware
which may have been neglected, underutilized or inadvertently stunted during
your pursuit of a high tech career.&nbsp; Many in the geek subculture view this
prospect with dismay, erroneously equating being a non-geek with being
normal.&nbsp; Normal people watch football on Sunday.&nbsp; They have minivans full
of kids who get dragged off to soccer practice or ballet lessons with annoyingly
repetitive regularity.&nbsp; They watch stuff like <i>The Bridges of Madison
County</i> on videotape.&nbsp; However, as accomplished, driven, High-IQ individuals
(i.e., geeks), it is essential that you realize exactly how staying locked
into one narrow subculture exclusively is analogous to having an &uuml;ber-chubby
multi-processor machine and crippling it with Windows ME.&nbsp; Everyone should
be able to fit into multiple subcultures and social situations -- getting
a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> will give you the skills you need
to make that crucial evolutionary leap as an individual working in the
high tech industry.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Will my LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
ever become obsolete?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>No, however, additional electives will be developed
and offered to enhance your skills set on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; To best demonstrate
the principle of continued value enhancement in an easily understood framework,
we offer the following paradigm:
<blockquote><b>LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> CERTIFICATION ==
OPTIMIZED FAULT TOLERANCE</b></blockquote>
The benefits of a LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
are comprehensive.&nbsp; The expertise you develop during your pursuit of this
valuable credential will serve as an asset not only in regard to your employment
objectives and experience, but also after you leave your place of employment
at the end of the day and even after you've moved beyond your career in
the technology industry.&nbsp; When considered from this perspective, it can
be said that the benefits accrued while pursuing your LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>
certification are truly cumulative and enduring.
<p><b>Q:&nbsp; </b>Will LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification
help me score with 1337 chiX0rz?
<p><b>A:&nbsp; </b>No, we're afraid there's no hope for you, really.&nbsp;
However, LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification has been empirically demonstrated
to benefit persons other than you in this regard.
<p>
If you have any further questions or would like additional information about this exciting opportunity,
please contact your official <a href="mailto:chloedancer@bitchwhorulesyourworld.com">Adequacy.org
certification representative</a> or her <a href="mailto:shoeboy@adequacy.org">highly capable
personal assistant</a> (a recently-certified LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Engineer).

<p>
We are certain that, like the dozens who successfully attained
LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification during our beta period,
you will find LIFE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> certification rewarding
and valuable.&nbsp;  We've done the hard work of providing a framework for your success, but
the final step is up to you.&nbsp; Good luck and remember:

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Am I the only one who finds this article utterly offensive? I don't mind the 'socially successful' telling the rest of us about their interesting lifes, my problem is when they start proselytising and Judging.<BR><BR>
Us watchers have a place in society. I like to watch life go by, I love to watch others live their lifes and write about it, I adore the comfortable, second hand existance. As someone who is impossibly, awfully shy, I refuse to have anything to do with having a 'life' in any first hand sense. If I were forced to have a life, I would kill myself first. I do not wish for the parties, the dating, the loudmouthed bragging and emotional manipulation and dishonesty that it seems to entail. People such as myself are accutely aware that:<ul>
<li>Hell is other people. That's right, <i>other people</i> are vicious, dishonest and nasty, by and large. They are best avoided.
<li>Life is combat. Any 'decent' social life involves a constant, low intensity friction with other people, one with a diurnal rhythm, from breakfast with people you don't like to supper with horridly overfamiliar strangers. This is social 'obligation', the big prison 95% of humanity submits to for they lack the courage to go it alone. Some call this healthy, social bonding, but I prefer to think of it as a constant aria of discomfort with a drumbeat of punctual, putrid and predictable moments of extreme embarrassments and <i>faux pas</i>. You may enjoy this and find it invigorating; it scares the hell out of me, so I stay away.
</ul>
But why do these people assume that those of us who lack a 'life' (by <i>their</i> definition of life, of course) desperately want one? I do not, and many of us don't. I shun the milk of human kindness, spit it in your ugly face!<BR><BR>
The only explanation is that they somehow feel that, just possibly, defining themselves, and their self worth, by whether they have 'lifes' is flawed in some way. After all, they are defining themselves by <i>what other people think of them</i>, defining themselves by whether they have been laid in the last couple of weeks, or whether they have been to enough empty parties. Well fuck that, man, stuff your <i>Carpe Deum</i> shite if all it means is getting pissed and having a one night stand in a motel.<BR><BR>
No. I am a <b>watcher</b>. I don't want human contact, I don't need it. I like my splendid isolation, and I intend to stay isolated for the rest of my life. I do like to contemplate others having their fun (though perhaps not people who crow about having 'lifes', they are invariably empty and uninteresting), I like to consider the many fields of human social contact. I like to think of it all on a theoretical, platonic level. I like to write silly, idealistic romances that are as far from the truth as could be. I am a cynic desperately trying to be a romantic, but unable to trust himself enough to make the jump. I think the sceptic should always have the upper hand within me, and I am happy with my lot. Please don't lecture me on my need for a life.<BR><BR>

This is hardly likely. I have no interest in all that technical stuff, find it boring, really. I'm about as likely to lecture about the linux operating system as I am to lecture about the best type of refrigerator, or the best sewerage scheme for residential areas. Yawn.<BR><BR>
Although some shy people are shy because they can't understand other people very well, and prefer the solace of machines, or abstract mathematics, I think there is another class that is shy because we understand others <i>too well</i>, see the uglyness and the beauty in everyone. Combined with a sensitive disposition this can lead to defensive misanthropy and, worse, a cynical, hard bitten, bitchy exterior designed to keep others at a distance. The worthless, beautiful, fuckhead others.<BR><BR>
I myself have obtained peace by just saying 'fuck it'.  Although a desperate romantic at core, my imagination rules me and I can live vicariously through others, through books and films, through tales overheard and my fantasies written down on meditative evenings. Too untrusting to seek these things in others, torn by the contradictions of scepticism, cynicism, and the overwhelming desire for love, I best serve myself through total isolation, by living with myself and my fervent imagination, not others.<BR><BR>
I fear that any romantic entanglement with another person would be the end of me, would finish me off by exploding the contradictions. So to hell with it, I say!<BR><BR>
The only reciprocation I do is imagined, never actual, never real. I will never dirty myself with reality. And I'll never complain, I prefer things this way.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

And why on earth did you feel compelled to share your penchant for unrealistic romantic fiction with the rest of us?  If you really reject social convention, then I'd at least expect you to avoid any mention of romance on Valentine's day.

If you really believed all that stuff you wrote, then you wouldn't let anyone else see it, and you'd order it destroyed when you died.  That's what Kafka did, you know.  Disagreeing with Donne does not put you on a par with Kafka.  And speaking of Donne, let's have a look at the whole passage, so you realize exactly what you're disagreeing with:
<BR><BR>
"<i>...No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee...</i>"
<BR><BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --John Donne, 1624
<BR><BR>
That sort of reminds me of Hemmingway, for some reason.  He had a thing or two to say about your "splendid isolation," too.  Best of luck.

That's right, nobody else will see it, nobody else has ever seen it, nobody else will ever see it. That writing is about personal emotions, dreams and so on in a very specific and revealing way. I don't particularly want anybody to see it, ever. This thread is an exchange of considerably drier ideas, and although certainly of a personal nature I have no concern at this level of revelation on a distant weblog, as long as I remain thouroughly anonymous.

I wasn't talking about your romantic fantasy writing, silly.  I don't expect anyone to make that sort of stuff public.  In fact, I wish they wouldn't.

No, I was referring to the socializing that you are doing right here.  Asserting your identity, seeking validation from others in the form of agreement or debate, that sort of thing.
<BR><BR>
You can go ahead and insist that this is "dry" or "distant," but the fact of the matter is that it is unequivocally social.  If you just wanted to <i>watch</i>, then you would only <i>read</i> the site.  But the fact of the matter is that you want to assert yourself in the company of others, to engage in the very "competition" of identity that you so deride.  So you <i>post</i>.  
<BR><BR>
You want to be <i>accepted by others</i>, perhaps not for what you are (a person whose social life occurs primarily over the internet), but rather for what you want to believe you are (a pure hermit, aloof, gazing down upon others and the petty games they play).

I like to watch, too.  Even more, I like to share my insights with those I observe, and with others.  I don't mind at all if others watch me, and share their insights, too.  I actually kind of like it.

His behaviour is very similar to what couples do when fighting -- i.e. slamming the door and promising to leave forever. Of course, you know that she has no intention of really leaving -- rather, she's sitting quitely behind the door and waiting for him to start weeping.

<BR><BR>

It's sort of a power-trip in reverse -- by aggressively asserting that you don't care, you have a way of asserting control.

P.S. This is why people say that women usually fall for those men who act apethetic towards her. Same mechanism is at work here.

actually a method designed to help employers
weed out the geeks from the homosexuals.

Yes i'm dirty and inarticulate but at least i'm
not gay. And besides, i dont really care if i have
the skills to attract women. I have a better method

<i>Us watchers have a place in society.</i><BR><BR>
I don't wish to claim to be some absolute island. I certainly can't say I don't depend on others, I do or else I would starve. I am an island only in the sense that I shy from human interaction on a personal level.<BR><BR>
It can be profitable in many ways, when I have control over the course of it and my own level of involvement, and I am distanced from the proceedings. This is certainly true on this weblog forum. It is profitable to exchange ideas with others.<BR><BR>
I don't claim my way is <b>right</b>, I just think it is right for me.<BR><BR>
Anyway, I'm not a rational creature and I don't live by some rational plan. The bottom line is I feel comfortable with this level of interaction. Call it social if you will, but I don't think true friends or enemies, or lovers, are possible over the internet alone, and especially not in the rather intellectually dry discussion sites I sometimes post to. As we are talking about me and my experiences, this is really what matters. Thank you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Now you've admitted you're participating, and sort of grudgingly acknowledged that you're socializing.  Good.  
<BR><BR>
Now check this out: just about everything you've written in this thread, apart from a brief attack on "beautiful" "normal" people, who you don't spend any time with, has been about yourself.
<BR><BR>
That's fine.  There's no harm in talking about yourself.  But don't you think someone who "watches" would show a lot more interest in the people talking to him?
<BR><BR>
So let's figure out what you <i>really</i> are, OK?  You say people like yourself, which you have misnamed "watchers," have a place in society.  What place is that, do you imagine?  Do you feel people like yourself are especially fair judges of others, or something?  I'm groping in the dark here.  What, exactly, is your role in society, now that you've admitted you aren't an island?
<BR><BR>
Similarly, you say that you "profit" in "many ways" from your on-line social life.  What are they?  Does this minimal contact serve to reassure you of your intellect or capacity for compassion?  Yes?  No?  What then?  Could you list some of the "many ways" in which you "profit?"
<BR><BR>
Now then.  You keep mentioning love and beauty.  These are not things well suited to on-line social interaction; they're much easier to create and aprehend in the flesh.  After all, all you have to do is smile.  
<BR><BR>
Smiling is difficult for some people.  Some people haven't learned how many reasons there are to smile, and don't recognize many ways of smiling, so they get scared when others smile, and think the smiles are "fake."

I try to be nice, I try to help, I ask a few simple questions, and you interpret it as "aggression?"  Looks like my guess about the reading of smiles fell close to the mark!

What role do you feel you play in society?  You admit that you depend on others for food.  What else, other than the bare necessities?  I'm also interested in what you feel you contribute, or might potentially contribute, to society.  Can you give us a hint?  Try to describe these things in terms of interactions with others, rather than with labels like "watcher."
<BR><BR>
You said that there were many ways in which you "profit"** from the exchange of "ideas" with others.  Is saying that it is "useful" to have your ideas "challenged" by others just a way of rephrasing that without explaining it?  If so, then what do you mean by "useful?"  And which "ideas" did you have in mind?  If not, then what are some of the other ways in which you "profit" from the exchange of "ideas" with others?

I don't think I <i>depend</i> on anyone for anything outside the bare necessities. Certainly I am part of a huge, modern, capitalistic machine and depend, in an anonymous way, on an economic web that encompasses just about everybody in the world. But none of that is personal.<BR><BR>
On a personal level, I don't depend on anybody at all. I have no friends, no family, no obligations or indeed people obligated to me. I work in an isolated area for a government concern that means I can minimise contact with people in terms of my career as well. I contribute to society in an anonymous way, through my job (which I can't really explain for various reasons of privacy).<BR><BR>
Now, I enjoy having my ideas attacked by others because it makes them stronger. This means that they are more likely to be rigourous (though perhaps not more correct), and I can modify them when they are faulty. The ideas I am talking about can be anything, really, anything at all - any of the ideas expressed anywhere in this thread, and on various other parts of the web where I have argued about some of my interests (such as politics, for example, or fiction - some people love to argue politics, even if they don't particularly want to be part of the <i>polis</i>). I think it is hard to pin down, when 'idea' can refer to just about anything. But I'm sure you get the <i>idea</i>!<BR><BR>
I suppose it is a rather optomistic thought, that through conflict of people clashing their different, contradictory ideas a new and superior synthesis can arise, but it just requires open mindedness. To argue not for victory, but to learn.<BR><BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First note on language:  "Okay" is not a word.  It is written OK, as a brief look into its <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html">etymology</a> will show you.
<BR><BR>
Now then.
<BR><BR>
You describe written interactions with others as "profitable," insist that things shared and experienced are "ideas," and call the results "useful."  This is not the sort of language usually used to describe communication; it is, instead, the language used to describe a capitalist economy.
<BR><BR>
For the sake of argument, let us assume for a moment that your implicit economic metaphor is valid, and explore its implications.  Let us assume that there is an <i>economy of ideas</i>.
<BR><BR>
What is "profit" from an idea?  In the <i>economy of ideas</i>, profit consists of more ideas, or ideas of higher quality or value.  One then trades or invests these ideas in hopes of a favorable return.  The goal, apparently, is to amass vast quantities of valuable, high-quality ideas.
<BR><BR>
You could, of course, regard this as an end in itself.  In the fiscal economy, there are those who seek profit as an end unto itself, living like paupers while their investments mount by the million.
<BR><BR>
But these are unhappy people, marionettes jerking miserably through life, ruled utterly by the singular compulsion of hoarding money.
<BR><BR>
Rich people of greater spirit exchange their accumulated wealth for other things.  I do not speak of the fancy automobiles or other luxury goods that the bourgeois are so quick to deride (and so apt to covet).  I refer, rather, to free time spent with loved ones; to fine food and drink; to the rewards of charitable giving; to appreciation of the arts; to any experience which, while bearing a monetary price, fulfills or furthers some joyous aspect of our humanity.
<BR><BR>
Where, then, are the goods and services that the tokens of an <i>economy of ideas</i> might be exchanged for?
<BR><BR>
It is conceivable that these ideas might be used to achieve political office, or more generally, to achieve <i>social position</i>.
<BR><BR>
Other, more common rewards might be imagined: joy in giving an idea away, relief at resolution of a personal conundrum, contentment in the acceptance of others who value ideas, and so forth.  These are all <i>emotional</i> rewards.  In this respect, they are no different from the satisfactions available to a successful participant in the fiscal economy, as outlined above.
<BR><BR>
Your language has appeared, at times, to be a strained attempt to avoid any reference to emotion, but the emotional implications of the metaphor you have chosen are clear.
<BR><BR>
If you do not accept the notion of an economy of ideas, then I suggest you start using words like "fun" and "satisfaction" and "gleeful" and "pissed off" and other emotional terms to describe your motivations for written communication.  It's easier, and other people will have less trouble understanding you.
<BR><BR>
I think that you, "The Observer," can be emotional in your written social life.  Your initial post, for example, was much more emotional than your last one.  And your language is curious there, too.  In that message, you came closer to mentioning sex directly than you have anywhere else, but as soon as you did, your language shifted, first into incorrect latin (it's <i>diem</i>, not <i>deum</i>), and then into briticism (though the british would never use the word "motel").  It's as if you can not speak of sex at all in your chosen online "voice."  That's fine-- you don't have to talk about sex if you don't want to.  But it is revealing.
<BR><BR>
It is also revealing that you have registered an account.  In post #29, you take pride in the fact that you are "thouroughly [sic] anonymous."  But now you have taken a name.  It is not the name you <a href="../users/3370/index.html">wanted</a>, probably because you failed to provide a valid email address the first time around, but you nevertheless have a foundation now on which to build something that you clearly desire:  an <i>identity</i>.
<BR><BR>
As a final note on language, I've ignored your spelling so far.  I would recommend changing your posting habits for a while:  type your thoughts into software that implements an in-line spell- checker, and then cut-and-paste into your browser.  This will highlight your mistakes as you make them, thus encouraging you to type the corrections yourself (rather than selecting from a list of "suggestions"), and you will be much less likely to make the same mistakes again than you would if you used an after-th-fact, whole-document spell checker.
<BR><BR>
After using such software for a while, your spelling will improve to the point where you don't need to rely as heavily on the separate piece of software.  Microsoft Word implements this functionality; if there are any less expensive packages that do so, I am unaware of them.
<BR><BR>
I am familiar with the quote in your profile.  Fromm is excerpted in many collections of quotations, so it is possible that you are unfamiliar with the source of that particular sentence.  It is from <i>The Sane Society</i>, a book that I rather liked up until the last hundred pages or so.  In the book, Fromm makes the case that fear of isolation is used by some elements in society to control other elements, and he urges resistance to that, but ultimately, he is seeking not a society of hermits, but rather a society regulated to the greatest extent possible by pleasant interactions between people, rather than unpleasant ones.  He calls not for an end to human interaction, but rather for a change in the way that people interact.  I read the changes he advocates as a call for <i>more</i> recognition of emotion in day-to-day interaction, not less.
<BR><BR>
I want to know how you "watch" people in the real world without interacting with them.  I will give you the benefit of assuming you're not peering through binoculars at the apartment block across the street.  If you're living in a remote location, I can't think of anything other than television (satellite, most likely) that would allow you to "watch" other people without interacting with them.  What sort of stuff do you like to watch on TV?

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I do not think it is remotely valid, however. Economics is, after all, the study of scarcity - supply & demand. Ideas cannot be 'used up', and there is no shortage of them. They are not a commodity, and so any economic model falls flat. The best one can hope for is the occasional use of terms, such as 'profit' and 'loss', which are not economic in themselves, but are used in economics.<BR><BR>
Your response is also guilty of conflating intellectual curiosity with emotional responses. You seem to be trying to say that the goods and services in this 'economy of ideas' are all emotional in nature. In my opinion, this is nonsense. If I see something beautiful, I may feel emotionally moved, but it is not my emotions that inform me of its beauty. Intellectual desires may provoke secondary emotions, but they are not fundamentally emotional in themselves. Therefore, the goods and services in your posited 'economy of ideas' need not be emotional at all.<BR><BR>
You also seem to assume, in your analogy, that your 'economy of ideas' completely consumes me, rather than being a diversion entered into on the occasional newsgroup. Your economic model only covers a tiny part of my life; attempting to reach conclusions regarding my whole life based on a tiny proportion of it are rather silly.<BR><BR>
I regard myself as a very, very emotional person. I find my emotions very overpowering, and sometimes I can let them get the better of me. When I post here, I prefer to keep <i>emotional content</i> to a minimum. Emotions are good as personal rewards and punishments, but why tell other people what emotions one is feeling? Sometimes I can do so unwittingly, but why do so voluntarily?<BR><BR>
I prefer to think that the ideas are not 'exchanged', but that they do battle, and that new ideas spring forth from the battle, and new synthesis. Hegel made a lot of sense, for me.<BR><BR>
Why should I talk about sex?<BR><BR>
Also, I am British. I am also American. I had American parents at one time, and was brought up in Britain, though I now live in North America and have done for several years. This should explain any curios in my writing, I hope.<BR><BR>
This is not my real identity, and so it is still anonymous. 'The Observer' does not appear anywhere on my birth certificate. I have no problem with having an identity. A strong identity and sense of self worth is very important, and neither relies on society's judgement.<BR><BR>
As for television, I don't watch it. In fact, I don't even own a television. I just don't enjoy it. About once a month I have to go to the city to deal with certain employment obligations. I'd really rather not, because it unnerves me, and it is a long trip, but afterwards I find it has been exhilarating. On this one day of the month, after the morning when I have seen my superior in the offices, I often just wander through the parks, looking at people, and I like to sometimes get a cup of coffee, or even a McDonalds hamburger or something, and watch. These things may be normal for other people, but I find it exhilarating, romantic and mysterious. They wear me out though, and I seem to hate it at the time.

The economic metaphor was not meant to be especially extensive, so I
will not go into a critique of the notion that economics is "about
scarcity."  Your language suggested the comparison, and I attempted to
explore the ramifications.  No need to blow it up into a full theory
of the psyche.  <BR><BR>

Taking an identity is very different from the "thoroughly anonymous"
stance you adopted earlier.  I merely wished to point this out.  Now
ask yourself this: What does a "strong identity" mean, outside the
company of other people?  <BR><BR>

At any rate, you're asserting that identity here, socially, in
writing, rather than to yourself, so it is the social aspect of
Identity that is relevant to your name, "The Observer."  You seem to
have accepted, in a roundabout fashion, that your motivations for
posting here are emotional, but you still insist the activity itself
is not "really" social.  I will continue to assert that your posting
here is indeed primarily social, no matter how much you want to
believe it to be a purely "intellectual" activity.  <BR><BR>

Now let's talk about your notion of ideas "doing battle."  In a
"battle" of ideas, one or both ideas would be diminished, and, if it
were a decisive battle, some sort of territory would be won by one
idea or the other, and perhaps one idea would be annihilated.  That's a "battle." Nothing is born in a battle.
You, on the other hand, seek a situation in which different ideas come
together to produce a young new idea.  Now, what's the metaphor that
springs to mind here?  
<BR><BR>
I'll give you a hint.  <BR><BR>

The original article writer, for example. It's true that a number of computer enthusiasts are antisocial, if not by design (it's usually not). I'm one of them. It's not that I don't want to have friends, don't want to socialise and meet new people, take in some of what life has to offer - I simply can't do it. I've been incredibly shy for as long as I can remember, and constant bullying at school made me draw even further into myself long before I even *saw* a computer. This is causing me problems even now, as I'm still rather shy, and far too self-critical. Everything I do or say feels wrong, even if I KNOW it's not. I'm trying to make the effort though. I'm now at Uni, with no-one from the past 18 years of my life aroud. I'm making new friends, having new exeperiences, and it's pretty good. 
<BR>

<BR>
I also agree with the first comment in this thread. It IS nice to have some solitude, just *your own* little space in the world, to sit back and watch it all go by without having someone else around to screw it up. Either way, I'm mostly happy.

I used to be a hypercritical self-involved shy loner...now, if anything, I'm a social addict.  The key is realizing that the only constraints put on your behavior are self-imposed (with the exceptions of the ones that will get you arrested and/or killed).  Realizing that the universe doesn't give a fuck about you can be extremely liberating.  Now go take a trip and start your new life.

You are not the only one.  Another laughable one is "Hunter"'s recent diary about Indianapolis.  So much of the arrogance on this site is just emptiness (although I do enjoy the Linux Zealot comics).
<BR><BR>
<i>Life is combat. Any 'decent' social life involves a constant, low intensity friction with other people, one with a diurnal rhythm, from breakfast with people you don't like to supper with horridly overfamiliar strangers. This is social 'obligation', the big prison 95% of humanity submits to for they lack the courage to go it alone. Some call this healthy, social bonding, but I prefer to think of it as a constant aria of discomfort with a drumbeat of punctual, putrid and predictable moments of extreme embarrassments and faux pas. You may enjoy this and find it invigorating; it scares the hell out of me, so I stay away.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yeah, it makes me a little ill too.  I can fake it -- you know -- take on whatever role is necessary to fit into some social occasion and interact with people, but it is extremely emotionally exhausting.
<BR><BR>
I guess I (and you) just do not find most people very pleasant to be around -- they are like masks with no real person behind.  Or maybe like animals.  But animals don't lie. -- Most people are hypocrites and liars (especially in the IT industry).
<BR><BR>
You call it "watcher" but I call it "hermit."  Some day I will be able to live the life of a true hermit, but I have other things I must complete first.

If you swallowed your pride, put aside your own fragile sense of ego and actually talked to others, you might hear some very interesting, enlightening and life-enhancing things.
<BR>

<BR>
And don't call yourself a hermit. The real hermits isolated themselves from others in an effort to be closer to God and humbly contemplate religious ideas and nature, not because they despised other humans.

So get out there and immerse yourself in the world. You'll be a happier (and possibly better) person for it.

Some of us don't want it anyway. I like your post in that it points out the terrible hypocrisy of many of my shy brethren, many of whom are weak and wish (secretly or no) to become social butterflies as tkatchev wisely noted.<BR><BR>
I don't wish for absolute hermitage, I just wish people would stop demanding and suggesting I interact like normal people. It becomes very distracting and is irritating. The shy have been second class citizens for too long, we have had to put up with articles like this mocking us forever, and I've just about had enough of it!<BR><BR>
I will engage with other people, but only where I have to, to survive. Real life has too many emotions and I lack the tools to deal with the complexities of other people.<BR><BR>
I prefer to watch, and to dream. Dreaming for me is better than reality, and I do it well. I have a rich fantasy life and merely ask that I am not interrupted by those who crow about their 'lifes' harshly mocking me and demanding I join in, become like them, be social, and confirm.

The difference is that Katz and (eech!) ESR are saying "geeks have no social skills and that's good!  Embrace your geek pride and delve into it!
<BR><BR>
The article says quite the opposite.
<BR><BR>
Being a g**k is not like being gay, or a member of  a group of immigrants trying to balance out keeping the traditions of the old country with rubbing along with the natives.
<BR><BR>
g**ks are fascinated with things electronic, mechanical, etc., and are curious about how to make them work, and will spend hours and hours trying to make them work better, or do new things which were not in the original design plans.  This is GREAT! (I know because I do this too).  
<BR><BR>
However, this is frequently done to the exclusion of hacking on human beings, social systems, art, literature, and other "soft, non-technical" subjects.  Being socially inept, culturally incurious, and a political lout is not something you're born with.  It is not a product of your society.  It's a "lifestyle choice".  If people felt better and liberated by getting in touch with their inner geek, I'd be all for it.  (Witness gays who try to "act straight" to get social acceptance, and feel miserable).  Unfortunately, the only person who seems to feel "liberated" being a geek is ESR.  'nuff said.

<BR>
a lightbulb pop out right above your head. This test
<BR>
is obviously designed to let employers know if an
<BR>
applicant is gay.
<BR>

<BR>
Us IT people can spot these homos a mile away. A
<BR>
well dressed properly groomed man wearing cologne
<BR>
obviously doesnt belong in a server room or cube
<BR>
farm clicking away at a keyboard writing software
<BR>
or managing networks. A person of this character 
<BR>
can only be one of a few things : 
<BR>

<BR>
A sales person who is trying to make the switch from
<BR>
"Sales" to "Engineering". Yeah right, we all know
<BR>
what sales people are like. Theyre a different breed
<BR>
of slacker. It's like mixing oil and water or 
<BR>
NAACP monkeys with KKK clowns. Yup, theyve learned
<BR>
how to be prissy in order to fit in with the 
<BR>
corperate world, making speaches and presentations
<BR>
about thigs they could never hope to comprehend
<BR>
or even care about.
<BR>

<BR>
A homosexual. These people carry the exact 
<BR>
characterstics of what the LIFE certs are all about.
<BR>
They dress well and care about their appearance 
<BR>
and are god awfully happy about everything. We
<BR>
all know just exactly why they smile all the time.
<BR>

<BR>
I find it disturbing that people are trying to
<BR>
take away the one thing 99% of the worlds geeks
<BR>
can brag about with pride. We cant possibly be
<BR>
gay because we just dont dress good enough to be
<BR>
so. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you dress nice and look professional, that still
<BR>
doesnt get you the pussy. Being LIFE certified and
<BR>
still not having a girlfriend just reinforces the
<BR>
the assumption coworkers will be sure to make, and
<BR>
thats homosexuality. 
<BR>

<BR>
And in the future i'm sure we will find a solution
<BR>
to this problem, when they make a drug that can
<BR>
treat homosexuals of their perversions, but for
<BR>
now geeks are better off just staying sloppy.
<BR>

<BR>
As for female geeks, theyres not really such a 
<BR>
thing. Theyre all fake. When is the last time you
<BR>
saw a woman sketch up a network diagram or write
<BR>
a few lines of code. Cmon people, they just dont
<BR>
exist. Women just dont have what it takes to work
<BR>
in IT.
<BR>

women were designed to cook it and wash the dishes.

I don't even have to leave my family to go for an example - my own mom. Not writing long programs (which is only because of the lack of need), but enough to write complicated database queries and active use of programming languages - up to dozens lines of code. One of her former jobs was design of heavy machinery, later involvement in manufacture of semiconductors. She was controlling a mainframe when you most likely hadn't even knew that computers exist.
<BR><BR>
I seen couple more - better - examples. Very few. Enough to firmly convince me they exist. Not enough to convince me there is any chance for me to get one - too low supply/demand ratio. Females are rare in IT - but the ones that get into and stay are <b>damn</b> good.
