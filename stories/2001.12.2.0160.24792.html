Marijuana is an insideous beast. It has a tendency to insinuate its way completely into the everyday lives of its 

users. No, this doesn't happen to all users. Many many people only smoke once in awhile and never fall into the 

lifestyle of the habitual pot head, but the proclivity of marijuana to become a central part of its users 

existance is undeniable.
<P>
Some other drugs have this tendency as well, but the only ones that do so on the same level are opiates. Even 

though methamphetamine and cocaine are highly addictive they don't lend themselves to the same type of total, 

long-term personality saturation. Unlike the habitual marijuana user, you can't take equivalent amounts of speed 

or coke every day for more than a couple years without totally destroying your life. They are drugs that reinforce 

the concept of moderation, at least among users who value their lives.
<P>
Sure, we all know that guy who spends entire weeks tripping, or the chick who goes clubbing on ecstacy almost 

every night of the week. The difference is that these people are the exceptions, and they never keep at it for 

very long. Their activities are more a function of age and transitory lifestyle than of the drugs themselves.
<P>
Some would argue that alcohol fits the same lifestyle-saturation pattern as marijuana and opiates like heroin. 

Some may even suggest that cigarettes fall into this category. What sets them apart is a matter of degree. Having 

a drink to relax is fundamentally different than getting a little stoned to relax. Even a little stoned is still 

stoned, and you still have glazed eyes, a stupid grin, and an inability to carry on a decent conversation with 

non-stoned people. Yes, there are alcoholics, but they are definitely a small minority. As for cigarettes, the 

narcotic effect is so miniscule as to almost not be worth mentioning.
<P>
The tendency of other drugs to inforce moderation in their users can usually be rightfully seen as corollary to 

their potential danger to the user. In this light marijuana may seem superior in that it doesn't present such a 

health risk. However, it is that risk that keeps those other drugs in their proper place.
<P>
A drug is something that alters you and changes how you react to the world. If you engage in drug use on weekends 

or special occassions then you are essentially taking a break from life. You are on a drug-induced vacation. But 

if you take drugs damn-near every day then your use takes on a whole different meaning. You are not doing it to 

have fun anymore, you are taking medication.
<P>
Are you a habitual marijuana smoker? Do you need daily medication from life? How did you get to this point? You 

started smoking with your friends when you were out having a good time. It enhanced the fun. What changed?
<P>
The above points can be addressed with the same answer to the question of what makes marijuana worse than heroin 

and opium. Unlike those drugs, marijuana lies. Every junkie knows that they are a junkie. Every person who wastes 

away each evening in an opium den knows that they themselves are also wasting away. Every other drug out there 

reminds its users that, no matter how much enjoyment they receive, there is a price to be paid. Every one except 

marijuana.
<P>
Marijuana tells you that you are a better person for having smoked marijuana. Marijuana tells you that you are 

more creative when you smoke marijuana. Marijuana tells you that it helps you concentrate. What marijuana 

<I>doesn't</I> tell you is that you feel more creative because you have lost the ability to judge your work from 

the vantage point of someone who isn't stoned. It doesn't tell you that it replaced your critical thinking skills 

with the naive wonder of a six year old. It doesn't tell you that your present vague awareness of your 

surroundings is <I>not</I> the same thing as being relaxed and at peace. And most importantly, it doesn't tell you 

that when you become an habitual user its effects persist even when you are not longer stoned.
<P>
The similarities of former marijuana smokers' testimonials should tell you something. "After two weeks it was like 

a haze was removed from my life." "I felt like I had finally woken up." "I couldn't believe how much more alive I 

felt after a month away from it."
<P>
Any drug that takes two to four weeks of non-usage before you even realize what a mess you were is seriously evil. 

Drugs that deceive are not to be trusted. If a drug's entire purpose is not to have fun, but rather to make the 

user believe that the drug itself is harmless and has little real effect, then what point is there in taking that 

drug?

But I have seen what habitual marijuana use has done to close friends, family members and the teenagers with whom I work. 

<BR><BR>You're right--it's nearly impossible to get this message through to someone who is in the teeth of a serious marijuana habit.  Most people think that because pot isn't "physically" addictive that means it is safe and easy to stop using.  However, behaviorally and psychologically it is one of the most ensnaring drugs I've ever encountered. I've seen close friends wake up first thing in the morning and light up.  This would continue through the day, even at their jobs, and on into the night until the last thing I would hear was the sound of a one-hitter tapping against an ashtray. 

<BR><BR>It's easy to think that pot smoking isn't detrimental... it usually doesn't have the aggressive factor found in so many drugs and it has quite a few physiological benefits.  But it is an extremely <i>dumb</i> drug.  Impaired reflexes, motor skills and thought processes cannot, even in the short term, be good for you.  And when used for self medicating (as the author mentioned and as I've seen oh-so-often in the kids with whom I work) marijuana usage can cover up serious emotional and behavioral disorders, such as ADHD, anorexia/bulimia, oppositional-defiant disorder, etc. 

<BR><BR>Another thing I've seen <i>very</i> often is the tendency for depression in the marijuana user.  Certain drugs, such as opiates, ecstasy and pot, can stimulate or suppress the receptors in the brain that produce serotonin--the brain chemical that helps regulate mood and sleep.  Too much serotonin creates euphoria or panic, as seen with E.  Too little can produce serious depression, especially after long term use of the drug that is either suppressing the serotonin receptors or over stimulating them to the point where serotonin production falls off dramatically.  And those with preexisting depressive disorders who take medication such as Serzone can have sometimes serious mood affection disorders if marijuana is used while taking this medication. 

<BR><BR>So enough medical babble from me... I agree that the logic to not use pot due to the scary side of the drug is lost on many who are currently smoking, some even as we speak whilst they giggle at our pretty sentences.  But it's not bad information for those who might know someone with a marijuana "problem".  Namely, the guy next door who built furniture out of Domino's Pizza boxes. `Strue.<BR><BR><BR>Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you.  <i>Bill Hicks</i><BR></FONT></td>

Too often in my high school and college years did I see friends and acquaintances start a dalliance with the demon weed, starting with the occasional <i>puff</i> of a hand rolled bong at a party, to daily <i>toking</i> fests. Their grades and activities all dwindled into <i>scoring</i> enough smack to keep them high the next day. I would, on occasion, attempt to reach them by listening to their stoned ramblings about the movie they would make, the incredible inventions, the wonderful story, and yet the next morning they would sleep in and skip their morning classes, then play ultimate frisbee and skip their afternoon classes, eventually dropping out of school to get lives delivering furniture, or some other job where will power is not needed, just the ability to lift heavy things. What a waste, intelligent young men and women who were on their ways to becoming engineers, scientists and theologians, turning into furniture movers, burger flippers and custodians, all because they couldn't defer the pleasure of getting high to go to class.

I think it's no coincidence that marijuana use increased in the 1960's as youthful unrest also increased. Someone in a higher position realized that the quickest way to pacify and paralyze the agitating youth of America was with the kynd. I think prayer and Biblical studies would have accomplished much the same, at far less of a cost in human lives, but no one asked me.<BR><BR><BR>

Heaven and hell are nonexistant and are only there for those people who don't really care about the welfare of others, they only care about going to heaven. I do good deeds every moment of my life, not because I am striving to go to heaven or not to go to hell (since they don't exist), but because I care about every person that I come in contact with, even those I don't (come in contact with). Also, remember the meaning of christianity- love thy neighbor (even if they are not christian) and let God do the judging, not you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Is the statement:

<BR><BR><i>As always, liberalist have a termendous(sic) problem differentiating between a personal, subjective "truth", and a factual, objective "truth".</i>

<BR><BR>truth?  Does it even rank as a "subjective" truth?  Or is it merely an <i>opinion</i> formulated by you, as you are entitled?  If this is the case, and you are entitled to <i>opinion</i>, wouldn't that same entitlement be awarded to the AR?  After all, <i>subjectively</i>, we are all entitled to our <i>own</i> definition of "truth".  But that does not make <i>subjective</i> "truth" <b>true</b> for all.

<BR><BR>Perhaps SpaceGhoti was referring to your ego, pot.  This would make sense, based on your predisposition to debunk the opinions of others with arguments based merely on nothing but your <i>own</i> opinions, which you tend to restate as if they were fact.  Which is ironic.

What's worse is the fact that it is utterly impossible for you to see <b>my</b> viewpoint without reliving my life in all of its entirety; which means that rather than going into a genital-size war about whose "truth" is better, it is much more advantageous to try and see the other person's viewpoint the way he see it, instead of trying to disprove it right off the bat.

But, I wouldn't expect you to understand anything out my tirade. As a liberalist, your ideas of "tolerance" extend only to the ideas that make you comfortable. (That was my own personal "truth"; I'm explaining because liberalists usually have a long-standing conflict with reality.)

<BR><BR>Your <i>opinion</i> of liberals is fine, and is your right to express freely. However, it is also a <i>generalization</i> as you are not making allowances for those liberals who <i>do not</i> have a long-standing conflict with reality, who <i>do not</i> define tolerance subjectively, and who <i>do not</i> fall under the various generalized statements you have made on their character.

<BR><BR>As it would be impossible for you to actually know each and every liberal in the manner you are to which referring, your statements concerning the nature of liberalists are merely conjecture.  <i>Opinion</i>, yes, but far from any form of <i>truth</i>, either subjective or objective.

<BR><BR>Just so that you understand my point of view-- "liberal bashing" does not hurt my feelings, make me mad, offend me or in any other way make me emotional.  As a liberal, and having first-hand knowledge as such, there are many liberals and conservatives alike who deserve ridicule for their extremist philosophies and inability to look outside of their own individual views to consider those of the "other side".

<BR><BR>My issue, again, is your tendency to generalize.  For me to say that all conservatives are insensitive or irrational based on a few examples would be wrong.  And for me to say, "As a conservative, your ideas of 'tolerance' extend only to the ideas that make you comfortable" would also be wrong, because the fact that you are conservative does not give me allowance to make other judgments on your character.  The issue could be the type of car one drives, or where one went to school, rather than this liberalist/conservative nonsense for all that matters--assuming the character of another based on a few facts is still disrespectful, invalid and doesn't make for productive discussion.  I hope you see my point.

<BR><BR><i>But, I wouldn't expect you to understand anything out my tirade.</i>

<BR><BR>Oh, I think I <i>have</i> understood quite a few things "out your tirade", as you say.  Don't sell yourself short, tkatchev old pal.  Occasionally you are quite understandable, and would make an interesting person to discuss various issues with, if only you would get over that pesky habit of restating old claims rather than moving off onto exciting new discourse territory.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It goes without saying that this is an editorial piece.  Regardless, I feel the need to assert that it is not based on factual information or even, apparently, any kind of anecdotal evidence.
<br><br>
Your claim is made up front: "<strong>Marijuana is an insideous beast.</strong>"  The rest of your ramblings do little to further your case and are little more than a repetitive insistence on the same theme.
<br><br>
You have a right to your opinion, of course.  You don't, however, have the right to manipulate the truth.  There is an obvious tone of distaste, if not outright resentment and loathing, towards marijuana and marijuana users from the outset of your piece.  You begin calling them "pot heads".  You then go on to make wild, unsupported claims like, "Even though methamphetamine and cocaine are highly addictive they don't lend themselves to the same type of total, long-term personality saturation."  Anyone who has known closely someone with a serious substance-abuse problem knows that this is simply not true.  There a couple of members of my extended family, one in particular, with whom I know this does not ring true.  There are still more that I have made the acquaintence of.  Your continued claims in this vein such as, "They are drugs that reinforce the concept of moderation, at least among users who value their lives," are preposterous.  People who value their lives <strong>don't do</strong> methampetamine and cocaine.  I've seen this too many times firsthand to believe otherwise and I can only assume that you lack this experience based on your claims.
<br><br>
Furthermore, your defense of socially acceptable substance abusers like alcoholics and smokers is beyond the pale.  To assert that relaxing with a drink is "<strong>fundamentally different</strong>" than smoking marijuana for reason of the supposed inability to converse while under that influence shows your total ignorance of the reality of these substances and inexperience with their typical users.  Have you ever even been to a bar?  Trying carrying on a conversation with a drunk person.  Better yet, you can try talking to my drunk aunt the next time she calls.  You couldn't stop there, though.  You had to assert that "<strong>there are alcoholics, but they are definitely a small minority</strong>."  <a href="http://www.canoe.ca/HealthReference/arf_alcohol1.html">How many people are alcoholics?</a>  About 5% of the adult population.  That's no small number, and though it is a minority in comparison to the total adult population it's no small slice when it comes to the substance abusing portion of this populous.  I can only assume that you have never actually known a junky either.  You sound so certain when you claim "Every junkie knows that they are a junkie."  I know quite a few young people who have experimented with heroin and for all of them but a couple (read: the rare exceptions) it has been true that they get quite near the brink of disaster (read: overdose) before they ever kick the habit... if they ever do.  The mode of operations is usually an extended period of relapse and recovery in a cycle that is hurtful to everyone who has to watch someone they love suffer through it, but most of all it is harmful to the person going through the morale shredding process of giving in to their addiction over and over again.  What brings them down this long path is denial: "I'm not a junky.  I'm not addicted."
<br><br>
You are, as mentioned above, entitled to your opinions.  However, if we are ever to actually deal with our country's drug problems as adults we have to <strong>stop</strong> re-iterating the same old lies and drug war mythos and start telling the truth.  I have a challenge for you.  Assuming that you are old enough, go down to your local bar for three nights in a row.  Look for the people who were there all three nights.  They are your alcoholics.  I'll bet you that they're smokers, too.  Go introduce yourself, but wait until after midnight (don't worry, they'll still be there).  Try and strike up a conversation and see what you get.  Then try going back a week later and see if they can even remember you.  We need to stop pointing the finger, as you have, <strong>at the drug</strong>, or "insideous beast", and come together in the realization that substance abuse is a problem.  It's a very valid problem that quite a few people have.  
<br><br>
People who abuse themselves in this way have deeper personal issues that need to be addressed and they do not get the recognition and help that they need in our system.  They are criminalized and demoralized.  In California you can receive SSI, a social security benefit like disability, for certain mental disorders.  Usually this is granted for varying forms of depression and other types of personality disorders.  Why can these people, people with a valid mental health issue, receive money, treatment and medication when we leave people with substance abuse issues out in the cold, often for dead?  I urge you and everyone else to take the time to educate yourselves about the realities of these issues.  They are issues that we will all have to face together, and the only way we can address them adequately is with the proper information.

I must say, it didn't come across as a tired, worn out, cliche riddled pile of pablum at all. However, you would do better if you could manage to stick to the topic at hand. Here, let me reprint it for you:

We will be evaluating it solely in comparison to other narcotics and mind altering substances.</blockquote></b>

You see, we are not discussing an <a href="http://newkidhomevideo.com/AfterSchool.html">After School Special</a> or a topic on <a href="http://www.oprah.com/">Oprah</a>. I am pointing out that marijuana use has serious negative effects in comparison to other drugs, effects that habitual marijuana users are too stoned to even be aware of.

If you wish to try to defend marijuana, please do so. If you wish to embark on an addict treatment crusade, please do so somewhere else.

This is very similar to the point that the author was trying to make. People who value their lives will not use these drugs, or if they do it will only be once or twice. They will, however, do marijuana, despite the fact that it is just as harmful in its long-term effects.
<blockquote>What brings them down this long path is denial: "I'm not a junky. I'm not addicted." </blockquote>
Giving up a drug has nothing to do with admitting you have a problem. Addiction is often a physical thing, and people trying to give up a drug will experience violent withdrawal symptoms. What brings them down this long path is their addiction to the substance, combined with the saturation of pro-drug messages such as your own in our culture(<cite>lies and drug war mythos</cite>)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I'm a fairly successful senior programmer/sysadmin for a fairly successful business  and I love what I do, and have no problems working to achieve my goals while under the influence of marijuana. I routinely smoke $50-100 worth of marijuana a day, yet I have retained all of my mental faculties. There have been many occasions that I have smoked rather massive amounts of marijuana  (2-4 ounces) in rather short periods of time (1-2 hours) and gone to work and performed admirably.  I have designed and implemented a VPN for a fortune 500 company WHILE STONED. I have written essays which were apparently worthy of A's while stoned. The list goes on and on. To say that marijuana somehow impedes creativity or that marijuana makes the user "feel that the drug has little real effect" is nonsense. I feel the effect right now, a wonderful physiological state which
<BR>
 cannot be achieved by any other means.  Perhaps you haven't gotten your hands on any decent pot? 
<BR>

<BR>
$15 dollar 1/4 ounces don't give you a good impression about the effects of marijuana.

<BR><BR>Let's see how many articles on the front page have anything all to do with hating "*nix":

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.2.0160.24792.html">"Why marijuana is the worst drug"</a><br>
Nope.  Not that one.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.26.124138.29.html">"My inlaws are not fertile"</a><br>
Hmmm.  That one doesn't either.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.11.10.231853.12.html">The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, terrorism, and decolonisation"</a><br>
Well, so far it would seem you are hallucinating.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.24.234338.26.html">"Review: Saint Luke's Christmas Eve Candlelight Service"</a><br>
Looks like a pattern is developing.  Absolutely fucking nothing about hating "*nix"

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.24.22448.252.html">"Happy Birthday Christ!"</a><br>
An article about Christ and His love for us on his birthday.  Nothing at all about "*nix" in there.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.19.21302.725.html">"Security, Microsoft, and You"</a><br>
I don't know why this should "piss off" users of "*nix".  It has nothing to do with "*nix".

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.7.21410.1108.html">"Uncle OSM's Guide to Covert Dating: Episode II"</a><br>
My very own article giving dating tips to those of our readers unlucky in love.  Nary a mention of anything even remotely computer related.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.21.195051.13.html">"Linux Zealot learns a valuable lesson."</a><br>
Well, I guess this would qualify, even though it's true.

<BR><BR>So, let's see, out of EIGHT articles on the front page, only ONE could even be remotely viewed as anti-"*nix".

The fact that I enjoy smoking pot and using open source software is just a reflection of my aversion towards the brand of corporate welfare our society seems to be heading towards. It's about knowing that you can sit in your own home, that you paid for with money that you worked for, and smoke marijuana with your friends. It's about knowing that you can give one of the aforementioned friends a copy of your favorite operating system without worrying about violating several international treaties and going to hell for your efforts. It's about pride, and it's most certainly not about paying more than $30 for an operating system that rarely does what you tell it to do. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

   You seem like an intelligent enough person which is probably why you have been able to compensate for the drugs negative effects. But think, if you can be this productive with it, imagine  how well you'd do without it. Now I'm not saying to quit cold turkey but to try using it more recreationally. Use it to spice up that concert, or that trippy movie you were planning on seeing. Life's mundande tasks are meant to be just that: mundane. When you are stoned all the time you get to a point where feeling sober is more alien than feeling inebriated. When you save pot for occasional use it becomes that much more exciting and enjoyable.

   While this site does seem to exist primarily to upset /. geeks, that doesn't make this article any less true.

For those gentle readers who don't have the benefit of my decades of experience in the software industry, let me explain.
<BR><BR>
Programming and system administrating have two completely different skill sets, with little overlap between the two (hacking out shell scripts and Perl scripts is hardly programming). Furthermore, a competent senior programmer makes 3 times a competent sys admin. These facts make me question the veracity of your statements.
<BR><BR>
What competent business manager would have a senior programmer doing the scutwork of system adminstration? Do you see Kurt Warner selling hot dogs in the football stadium when the defense is on the field? Do you ever hear of head chef/busboys? I suspect this whole fairly successful business where you are a senior programmer/sys admin is little more than a <i>pipe</i> dream, if you catch my drift. <BR><BR><BR>

<blockquote>
Back in highschool it was just fun. We would just take a couple of joints in the morning to feel good. But then it came to skipping class in order to get stoned, spending money on weed and table soccer in the local coffeeshop until well after noon. Then it got bad. <BR><BR>
I lost my non-smoking friends. Finished school, got a job in IT. Work late, play hard. The weed helped me blow off steam. Or so I thought. I'd smoke myself in a coma watching tv and wake up late for work. After six months I was fired. Shortly thereafter my girlfriend left me. She just couldn't get in touch with me anymore, she said. I don't blame her.<BR><BR>
Now I'm on welfare and smoking 2 grammes a day. Sometimes I don't have enough money left to buy weed at the end of the month. I kill the time by doing the dishes or washing some clothes when that happens. Or sometimes the girl nextdoor helps me out. <BR><BR>
I tried to stop. But after two or three days I got horrible dreams and started sweating like a pig. Another time I got panic attacks that were so bad I almost couldn't leave the house to get some weed. Meanwhile they are threatening to cut my welfare, and the bills are piling up. I've stopped opening them. The last time I opened one I felt such a terrible rush of anxiety that I thought I was having a heart attack.<BR><BR>
What's really exasperating, though, is how nobody takes us pot victims seriously. Heroin addicts have their meth, the coke addicts -- well, everyone knows how dangerous coke is. But when you have a pot problem there is nobody there to help. Pot rehabilitation programs are virtually non-existant, and those that do exist are woefully ineffective. What pot addicts need is counseling by trained specialists, but who can afford that? It would be the least the government could do, seeing how they're the ones making this stuff so easy to get your hands on in the first place [note: the author is from the Netherlands]. <BR><BR>
So frankly I don't know where to go from here. I wish they'd all just leave me alone.<BR><BR>

Peace,<br>

<BR>
    I know what you mean.  I had a similar experience.  I smoked pot on occation in school, hung out with mostly stoner-types and AP students.  Finished school and got a job in IT.  Then it all went downhill from there.
<BR>
    I used to smoke only when offerred.  Then I started smoking out with my IT friends every weekend, and soon every day after work.  Then it got real bad.  Smoking 2 or 3 bowls with my roommate as soon as I got home every day.  Going in to work late.  I must have changed jobs 6 times since I started working.  And doubled my salery 3 times.
<BR>
    I got this extremely paranoid feeling and started researching everything I could find about our government and mary jane and the taliban, etc.  Long before Sep. 11th.  I discoverred the media conspiracy stories, etc.  But when Sep. 11th struck I knew I would be falling into a drug induced coma while this whole net ecnomy was going to topple down around me.
<BR>
    I'm still making 6 figures, going in to work after 10, 11, sometimes noon.  Smoking an O a month.  Most of my friends have left the state due to the ecnomic problems so I'm smoking most of that O myself now.  Hundreds of thousands, if not, millions of people lost their jobs.  I'm still watching people get laid off left and right.  Hell, I've asked to be laid off myself, but they "need" me or something.  Heh, whatever.
<BR>
    And you know what?  I saw all this coming months before everyone else.  I told everyone I could.  I complain, I bitch and whine and attempt to educate.  Then I sit back and smoke a phat bowl and let Americans fuck up their country one vote at a time, play my games, smoke another bowl, and forget.  Forget, forget, forget.  You'll never be able to remember it all anyway.  Besides why remember it when you can always look it up?
<BR>
    You know what?  Weed does make me less social.  It does (partially) hinder my ability to think creatively or function at my best.  My best?  I've NEVER functioned at my best.  Why?  Why should I function at my best when its so fucking easy to make LOTS of MONEY with all these stupid freakin Americans around.  Why when its so fucking easy to outperform my coworkings, even while being stoned off my ass, not that I work while being stoned, just as a comparison.  You want to know what my best is?  If I performed at my best I could have been another rocket scientist, quite literally.  I'm a mathematician and a physicist at heart.  But I also would enjoy the complexities and simplicities of computer algorhythms.  As it sits now I enjoy learning how to program, but I don't take a scientific approach to it, or anything for that matter.  Science doesn't matter to me.  No matter how smart I am I'm still just another stupid human.  I'll never know the truth about anything with so much misdirection by government and society.  You could be the smartest person on earth, able to recite everything you ever read in school, and still be working at taco bell.  The goal for most Americans is to make a lot of money and I've already obtained THAT goal.  My goal would be to learn everything I can in life and apply that knowledge, but WHY?  I'm having fun learning everything over and over and over again.  I could spend the rest of my life learning this way, or forgetting...  I can't remember.  But its all in good fun.
<BR>
    And Why should I not smoke just because you want someone to talk to?  I don't want to talk to you.  Have you ever thought about that?  Perhaps the reason I smoke so much is because you or your friends don't read enough.  But you sure as hell vote.  I'd perform at my best, and stop smoking weed, when you decide that money is not the goal in life, but instead knowledge and self improvement.
<BR>
    So in conclusion.  I'll quit when society pulls its head out of its proverbial ass.  Besides, I get such a kick out of outperforming people while I'm on drugs.  It really makes me happy to think that it takes a few bowls just to bring me down to your level.  ;)

<BR><BR>You claim

<BR><BR><i>&nbsp;...Unlike those drugs, marijuana lies...</i>

<BR><BR>I dispute that first of all.  It's a customary trick to conjure up a debate opponent and discredit his argument on the ground that he, (whom <i>you</i> have puffed up out of thin air), is either <i>deranged</i> or simply <i>mindless</i>.  Elenchos elegantly performs the former evolution above; the core of your argument is the latter one.  That the typical chronic smoker is <i>fooled</i> by the chemical where he <i>isn't aware</i> that <i>something has gone wrong</i>.

<BR><BR>"<i>Isn't aware</i>" first.  Tee hee, potheads are like so <i>zoned out mannn</i> that they <i>don't dig what's happening mannn</i>.  Cue up sitar music.  Cut to a commercial.  No.  On the contrary, I think you grossly underestimate the intelligence of human beings (that is, other human beings beside yourself, a selected some of your friends, and another handful of famous people whom you respect), really I do.  People in general do know what they are doing.  Jurisprudence assumes this implicitly, demonstrated best by its rare and extraordinary exception, the "defense by insanity," codified in the U.S. as the M'Naughton rule.  

<BR><BR>Rather than being <i>deluded</i> by a chemical which "lies," if I wanted to anthropomorphize, I'd say "the chronic marijuana smoker consciously and deliberately <i>makes a bargain</i> with marijuana."  My next point being, however, that I <i>don't</i> want to anthropomorphize.  You can't make a bargain with marijuana nor can it lie to you, it is inanimate.

<BR><BR>Finally, "something has gone wrong." If as I assert the chronic marijuana smoker freely and knowingly prefers his internal sensation of being affected by marijuana to not being so, what exactly do you object to?  Provided, of course, that some <i>fiend</i> is not <i>holding you down</i> and <i>forcing</i> <b>you</b> to submit to that <i>lying</i> drug that is.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First, thank you so much, zikzak, for providing me this golden opportunity to respond to this truly fascinating forum of capable minds and hot-button, brain exercising issues.  Having been a daily pot-smoker for the last 14-15 years of my life I see my destiny of opposition in your words.
<BR><BR>
My first task would be to utterly obliterate your perception of the typical potsmoker vs. a supposedly normal, "not-addicted-to-anything" (bullshit) human being. I can tell you of several 4.0 students I've known who go to class high.  I can also share with you the testimony of many successful bussiness owners who spark up daily (I fall into this catgory).  Nevermind several artists and musicians (another group of my peers) whom I'm sure you've heard of drawing inspiration from beyond the confines of the capitalist machine we all endure as a matter of survival.  
<BR><BR>
Self-medicated?  Yes, I am.  An addict?  Yep, and this is the point that needs to be made clearly:  by experience I have found this to be a very minor liability in my own existence.  My introduction to weed and it's subsequent saturation of my life is absolutely nothing like the perception you, your supporters, and everyone else in the world who have formed thier opinon of ganga users from watching those afterschool specials, and fearing social repercussions of alternative thought processes.
<BR><BR>
It's a given that folks are easily troubled in thier teens. For reasons not worth going into, I may have been on the extreme side of troubled. A good friend of mine turned me on to grass when I was 16.  After three utterly tortuous years of being placed on a variety of that era's "antidepressants" which included wonderful side effects such as reduced appetite, nervousness, sleeplessness, and impotence (NOT good for your average middle-teenage boy).  In my situation at the time these doctor prescribed, manufactured substances were the WORST drugs I could be ingesting, and I can look way back and still classify them as EVIL.  I was quite grateful to have found an answer to my wishes to finally feel something like "normal".
<BR><BR>
I'm enjoying my life now, much more than when I made the very concious decision to avoid those in my past who have chosen alcohol, meth and heroin (my musician experience introduced me to most every flavor of vice).  Of course I gave these diversons a shot, and found out very quickly they weren't for me.  I don't suppose you've ever had to sit with anyone all night trying to keep them sitting upright so they don't choke on thier own puke, have you?
<BR><BR>
Some folks on the other side of this issue may find it of interest that I do not have dreadlocks, I bathe every morning by 7am, and my vehicle is not a VW microbus - It's a Volvo station wagon.
<BR><BR>
The most obvious example of a potsmoker to anyone who would be reading this would be the dirty, dumb, broke and unmotivated loser.  I suppose that you have to take my word that I don't fall into this category.  You'll also have to take my word that due to my experience I can strongly suggest that you, zikzak, should not ever consider backing off your position.  I know that probably won't happen, but in reading your commentary I can't help but think that there is a specific individual in your life that is sufficient inspiration for your stance. If you're looking at this person (or persons, there may be a group you're writing about) with utter distaste at the waste of life they have become, chances are it would have happened regardless of the existense of the great green goddess they got on the wrong side of.  And it could happen to you, so stay away from my weed!
<BR><BR>
Many, many folks do not respond to the benefits as I have because, simply, they are not me.  The classifcations of "Evil" and "Worst Drug" seemed to be based on those situations where INDIVIDUALS lack the ability to put their existence in this life in perspective.  Speaking of perspective, my work is constantly judged by a wide variety of folks who may or may not be under the influence of anything other than life itself. It really does seem like my work passes muster quite well, thank you very much.
<BR><BR>
For me, and a few of my closest friends, it has a pervasive prescense in our lives because we find it beneficial to US.  We are not moving furniture and doing dishes anymore.  We are programming cell phones, publishing menus for succesful restaurants and designing webpages. All of these are tasks that require concentration, intellect and perseverance.
<BR><BR>
In regards the the "naive wonder of a six year old", what is so wrong about keeping in touch with that inner child?  I suppose that's another subject for sober grown-ups...     <BR><BR></FONT></td>

A person who began smoking marijuana to deal with the problems of a teenager. A person who, 15 years later, is apparently still trying to deal with the same problems, ones that the vast majority of us had outgrown by our early 20's.
<BR><BR>
Well you've certainly convinced me! I only wish I had possessed the wisdom to continue hitting the bong well after my teen angst had subsided. Why, instead of shrugging off the inconvenience of puberty, I could still be carrying that baggage around with me! Who knew?
<BR><BR>
You are truly a great person, peeps. Most everyone else I know managed to leave their insignificant pathos behind them once they grew up, but you've kept it close to your heart all these years. And you have the lies of marijuana to thank for never feeling the need to move on to something else.

I'm not posting here to inspire anything other than awareness of individuality (someone here actually accused me of being a communist, I'd like to sternly correct them), and the FACT that I know what works for ME and my PEEPS.  Angst is born of feeling misrepresented, which happens.  Time has taught me how to exist on my own terms, and among dickheads like you who wouldn't guess after an hour with me that I was the target of your angst towards a plant.

Identity politics are dead. I have to assume that you are still carrying around the opinions you picked up at college. Perhaps it is your long term use of the vile weed that has kept you in a state of suspended animation. Perhaps it is too difficult for you to keep up with the pressing issues of the day, while hitting the bong every other hour.
<BR>

<BR>
The modern media does not misrepresent people. It is simply not profitable to sell people an image which does not reflect their ideals. Observe the ease with which the media has fed rave culture to the young. (You'll like that, of course. Ravers are drug fiends, just like you.) The media has learned a thing or two since you dropped out. 
<BR>

<BR>
You have no excuse for feeling misrepresented. If you can't make the small effort to be a part of society, why should society slow down and make a place for you? Society hasn't excluded you. You've excluded yourself.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Let's just go ahead and call what I feel anger.  You, sir, are much more a product of modern media than I will ever be.

Programmed individuals like yourself happen to be the only bain of my existence. I expect nothing more and nothing less from the vast amount of media I ingest than to be made aware of what's going on in the world, and the opinions of those that I agree and disagree with. This matters to me, and the evidence is here in my posts.

Other than the proliferation of bland techno music, I've seen no other facet of media feeding rave "culture" (likened to mold) to our youngsters. Most of them can look at the hard facts of the damaging effects of MDMA, a much more serious problem than the vile weed.

<BR><BR>How about posting completely offtopic comments.  How about posting inflamatory comments, profuse with unacceptable language? 

<BR><BR>The topic at hand is MARIJUANA, which you admitted to using.  Not my medical situation, which is being treated by a LICENSED PHYSICIAN.  You dare compare your marijuana abuse with a medical therapy admistered by a person who has successfully completed medical school?  You people kill me.

<BR><BR>If you wanted to post comments about my condition, your opportunity was presented when I published those diary entries.  This is not the time or place.  This is an article about MARIJUANA and its effects.  I DO NOT USE MARIJUANA.

<BR><BR><i>So sincerly sorry about that, are you a site admin?</i>

<BR><BR>Yes, I am an editor here and have the ability to delete your nonsensical ramblings forever.  The only reason I haven't is because I have already received several emails from people laughing at you.  I decided the entertainment value was worth the waste of bandwidth.

<BR><BR><i>if not, sounds like it's time to go crying to daddy.</i>

<BR><BR>I am your daddy, bitch.

<BR><BR><i>...you've never met before of being a drug dealer, a communist, a pedophile and a "self-doubting, paranoid, lazy idiot"</i>

<BR><BR>You admitted to all of that yourself, buddy.  Maybe you should go back and read your comments.  Looks like your short-term memory is shot.

<BR><BR>Now, back to your little problem.  It is a well-known fact that marijuana spikes the levels of trinitrotoluene in the brain, causing severe violent reactions such as those exhibited by yourself on this very message board.  The only thing you are proving here is the medical fac that marijuana is a dangerous mind-altering substance that lures its victims into a false sense of security.  But as the trinitrotolouene levels continue to be unnaturally altered, even that false sense of security vanishes, giving way to even more violent outbursts, paranoia, anxiety, hallucinations and, ultimately, schizophrenia.

<BR><BR>I can't believe your little stoner buddy who is studying (para)psychology hasn't told you this.  Must be short-term memory loss?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

FYI, many Europeans take four or five languages for granted; for that matter, I have never met an ethnically Chinese Malaysian without at least four languages.  A good friend of mine, who is Dutch, speaks Dutch, German, English, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and has Greek and Latin as well - at 24.<BR><BR>Fundamentalism has a rather more specific meaning than you think.  With regard to Christianity, it means accepting the literal truth of every word of the Bible.  You may quibble with this, but that is the origin of the term.  I don't believe in this, so I am not a fundamentalist.  Nor are many members of this site, although we do have some valued contributors of that stripe; regardless, your use of the term is ill-taken.<BR><BR>I don't know where you're getting this nonsense about having a right to exist as you choose on God's green earth.  Maybe if no-one's actions affected anyone else, there existed unlimited free resources, and society had no need to educate its youth, your position would be sensible.  As it is, no-one is anything like completely free, and there's no end to that in sight.<BR><BR>What I was getting at about supremacy is quite germane to the topic at hand.  You may recall that, according to Jaspers, the goal of every Athenian was to establish himself as "the best among the best" (I think it was <i>aristei ten aristein,</i> or some such, but I haven't any Greek yet.)  The author's article talks about the ambition-blunting effects of marijuana, and I noted in my post that you give no evidence of the agonic drive whatsoever.  I don't know; maybe you see yourself as somehow working at becoming a great scientist, poet, adventurer, or soldier.  "Human interaction" sounded promising until I realised that you didn't mean through rhetoric or persuasive writing, you meant having a good time with your pals and chumming around.

Someone here has successfully put me in ultra-defensive mode, sorry about the name-calling.<BR><BR>Actually, I've long believed I can learn and do whatever I need to when opportunities and neccesities arise.  I'm heading back to class this summer to pursue a degree in engineering, and I suppose the languages of technology have been more of a focus of mine lately leaving those written and spoken ones by the wayside.  I write my own prescriptions for learning as well, with priorities placed on what sort of knowledge will be useful to me immediately.<BR><BR>For instance, in my late teens and early twenties I cooked in a variety of kitchens in which it was beneficial to learn Spainish, and I learned what I could to communicate with my co-workers handily. That friend of yours probably has practical applications for the languages he's learned, and I'd have to say I envy that. I suppose if I were better traveled and/or had a healthier interest in languages other than English, I'd pick them up.<BR><BR>So, on Fundamentalism, indeed a quibble or two.  I placed that definition of the term as a generalization noting the emphasis on intolerance, please accept apologies and as breif as possible explanation.  In a spiritual sense a lot of folks these days like to explore a variety of religons and draw from them what will be useful to better their existence and thier interaction with other humans. Fundamentalism as a concept does not allow for this exploration.  I would hope for the sake of any and all Christians reading this that they don't lay exclusive claim to this inflexible mindset, as the term "fundamentalism" is readily applied to certain factions I'm sure that we are all aware of that apply every word of the Quaran to thier death monger activities.  Alas...we're off topic again.  How all of this relates is the inherent dangers of intolerance of the actions and beliefs of others that don't share your views or perspectives.<BR><BR>And, of course I realize that my rights as a free-thinking, free-acting human being disappear as soon as I have a detrimental effect on the happiness and well being of my fellow humans. My decision to spark up in the comfort of my home at the end of the day doesn't even have potential to hurt anyone but me.  This brings us back to the issue of intolerance, and the danger that many "in the right" would disagree that I have that right threatens all sorts of personal freedoms that make life worthwhile, not just the topic at hand.<BR><BR>You'll have to forgive my using a literal definition of "agonic" drive rather than the context of Greek mythology (and I'm sure you can tell that I am woefully lacking in that feild of study as well) that you were actually refering to.  Agonic in an English translation equates to "having no angle" (ref: American Heritage Dictionary) which I translated for this context to mean neutrality. I then related that to my personal goal to remain as understanding as possible of the views of ALL of the many people I interact with every day.<BR><BR>In order to further justify my position that pot is not neccesarily the cause of demotivation among it's users, but rather that user's reaction to it...my repeated posts to this board against bitter and spiteful opposition should stand for something.  What matters more than that is the fact that human interaction should still sound promising to you, that's the only way issues like this get dealt with.  If I need to define what is driving me, then there you go.  My life is saturated with the nature and value of TRUE communication, which must include listening, speaking, reading and writing to as many folks with as many views as possible to try to find some common ground.  If any of those four factors are ignored or made light of, communication fails and our hopes of understanding each other are empty.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Nietzsche called the classical drive to be supreme the "agonic drive," and he claimed that competition - the destructive kind as well as the constructive kind, by the way - was the engine that powered the Greeks to greatness.  One famous example was the drama competitions leading to Greek drama becoming one of the greatest literatures in the world.  (Compare it with Roman drama to understand the total superiority of the Greek sort.)  Personally, I've always taken great inspiration from the eternal youth of Greek civilization.

That said, however, my own instinct tells me that the less potentially hazardous stuff I mix with conception, the lower the odds of having problems during and after pregnancy. This is the same instinct that, when I do get pregnant (be patient with me, Mr. Rightmann), will keep me from smoking, drinking alcohol, taking cold medicine, getting a perm or eating too much red dye #2.

As for marijuana as an 'actuator' of your mental health, I'd be interested to see how that works. My own mental health has been greatly enhanced by moving beyond my adolescent 'traumas' and accepting (embracing?) the responsibilities of adulthood. Those responsibilities can actually be quite enjoyable, and help me toward becoming the fully realized human being I'm striving to be.

I contrast this question with a radical under-statement: Alcohol was a factor in at least 100,000 American deaths last year. The office of drug control policy released statistics that 52,000 deaths were related to drugs, but this number includes "all drug-related deaths, including suicide, homicide, motor vehicle injury, HIV, pneumonia, hepatitis, endocarditis, and infant deaths, as well as overdoses" (&lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/corrections.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and, as you can tell, marijuana was the cause in only a fraction, if that, of those deaths
<BR>

<BR>
Based on these statistics alone, I feel it is impossible to call marijuana the WORST drug. To do so would be to overlook the other most commonly used and abused drugs in American society: nicotine, caffeine, alcohol. People suffering from nicotine addiction are prone to violent mood swings and irritation, not to mention the horrible withdrawal symptoms of trying to quit. Ever get in the way of a person who NEEDS a cigarrette RIGHT NOW? Other people feel they just "don't function right" if they don't get their dose of coffee in the morning. Alcohol speaks for itself: drunk driving murderers get off clean, alcholic husbands beat alcoholic wives who are really doing their best to raise their soon-to-be alcoholic children. (This may or may-not be an exaggeration, but I think I'm making my point) One must ask themselves "Why is marijuana illegal?" It's easy for you zikzak, because your drug has been made legal, however the fundamental difference you speak of is the same foundation for a drug abuse. At one time alcohol WAS illegal, right here in the United States, but that law was ratified because OUR VERY OWN COUNTRY was full of "hopeless drunks" (&lt;a href="./2001.12.2.0160.24792.html#13">

<BR>
The reason for bringing up three other drugs, is because they are the most common and most used by YOU, ME, and (just about) EVERYONE. And every one of those drugs is taxed by the government. Everything is simply a matter of: "Can the government make money from it?" (I guess I'm off on my 'pothead anti-government' kick, but really... think about it) The rainforest's would be saved if Hemp were turned into the cash crop it should be. The government tried to do away with alcohol, but realized they could make a fortune from it and people would be happy and buzzed, so it sacrifices 100,000 of its citizens each year and reap the benefits of dollars in the bank. It's only a matter of time before the government decides marijuana should be legal because its effects aren't 'that bad', then all of our pulp production problems will be solved, and nobody will die from marijuana related car crashes, just like they don't now.
<BR>

<BR>
People are high all over the place, all the damn time, doing an innumerable number of things to get that way. Some people, like you zikzak, are high on life, looking at whiskers on kittens and thinking about how warm their gloves are. Other people are high on life about going to church and praising Christ (which is somehow univerally accepted on this network as that which is RIGHT, and TRUE), lots of other people are hopped up on caffeine driving their car too damn fast on the way to work, and others are high and floating in a pool of alcohol waiting to drown in their own vomit tonight. &lt;/p&gt;

"Drugs that deceive are not to be trusted." Who, precisely, trusts in any drug, and what drug does not deceive? Rhetorical questions: Do people start smoking thinking "I trust this drug, so I am going to make a lifelong habit of this and die of lung cancer?" Do people start drinking thinking "I trust this drug, so I am going to get drunk and drive my car into oncoming traffic killing people?" No. Drugs are not to be trusted, but don't confuse what drugs are. Drugs are drugs, and we're addicted.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>How many people did Marijuana's illegal use kill last year? I contrast this... [blah blah blah]</i>

I don't know and I don't care. Relative danger was only mentioned tangentially in the article in order to make a totally different point. You aren't arguing on topic, you're spewing the same tired rubbish as everyone else.

<BR>
I'll answer in order:
<BR>

<BR>
Your thesis, in all reality, was very unclear. It was made perfectly clear that you didn't want to talk about "the morality of the drug war, 'gateway drugs', legalization, glaucoma or hemp", and that you clearly believe marijuana is the WORST drug, but your thesis does not exist in any traditional form. You went out of your way to stand behind other drugs, saying "[Drug user's] activities are more a function of age and transitory lifestyle than of the drugs themselves." As for the difference between holding a semi-reasonable conversation with a pothead, I believe it was made clear by an Anonymous Reader &lt;A HREF http://www.adequacy.org/?op=comments;sid=2001/12/2/0160/24792;pid=0;cid=8#8&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
<BR>

<BR>
The relative danger was not mentioned tangentially, because essentially you tried to convey the message that alcohol is an okay drug, while marijuana is not. My reply clearly stated that all drugs should be considered just that: drugs. The reason alcohol (as well as nicotine and others) has been so widely accepted is because it is now LEGAL to purchase these drugs and ingest them. 
<BR>

<BR>
I wasn't stoned when I read your article, and I wasn't stoned while replying to it. I think you were too stoned to realize that I made a valid point against your alcohol/cocaine/meth-praising and marijuana bashing, and it has damaged your ego so you need to 'spew' slurs at me about being a pothead. The fact that you don't care about the SCIENTIFIC and ACCEPTED statistics about alcohol/nicotine related deaths per year is really quite a frightening display of a twisted personality.
<BR>

<BR>
I was quoting you when I said I was off on a 'pot-head anti-government kick', because apparently you believe that the government is NOT full of greedy, money-grubbing hypocrites. The fact that you give no thought to anyone's opinion but your own, and discredit all opposing statements as being the ravings of crazed potheads shows precious little about the intelligence you want so badly to display. "Grown-ups" aren't necessarily the smartest people, but the knowledgeable ones realize that LISTENING skills are imperative to any worthwhile conversation.
<BR>

<BR>
In this light, I think it is important for you to re-read my statement to realize that I wasn't trying to justify any use of any particular drug. I never once stated that I am a user or abuser of marijuana or any other drug. I simply stated that based on statistics alone I feel it is impossible to call marijuana the WORST drug. If you had read what I wrote you would realize that I was bashing all drugs, if I was bashing any.

I mean, do I have to draw a picture?  Well, sure, of course I have to draw a picture.  I'm addressing drug fiends, after all.  Look:  drugs ruin your mind.  Drugs make you think what is bad is good.  Drugs make you tell lies, and believe them yourself.  <i>Everyone</i> knows this is a fact.  Even pot users know this.  Don't you tell each other "Never trust a user?"  Don't you?
<BR><BR>
Nobody knows better than you pot addicts that pot addicts can't be trusted.  So who do you think you're fooling?
<BR><BR>
I just want to add that I think this weak defense of "grass" is a pure insult to man's best friend, alcohol.  In every instance where it can be shown that pot will destroy your life, alcohol enhances it.  To claim otherwise it to attack one of the greatest American institutions, the beer, wine and spirits industry, not to mention the world-famous American tradition of mixed drinks.   I get <i>choked up</i>, I mean it, when I think on the colorful calvalcade of fine American beverages that pot smokers denegrate every day:  vodka, gin, whiskey, wine like champagne or a fun little lambrusco, or the endless good times of all the lagers, pilsners and more that the rich world of beer has to offer.
<BR><BR>
Where pot makes you <i>think</i> you're cool (see foolish pot-smokers like Bart Simpson or Bill Clinton for examples), alcohol really <i>does</i> make you as cool as cool itself:  Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Neal Young and every truly great American of the last 200+ years swore by <i>alcohol</i> as his <i>true</i> freind can companion in good times and bad.
<BR><BR>
You would admit that you are ashamed of yourselves, but of course, the pot is doing the talking and so you can't but lie.  <BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

I don't even understand how you can begin to phathom and compare the two. The have no common factors. Actual effects are to distant to be considered related. Alcohol has caused more Deaths over the time span of a year than Marijuana has in all it's existence. Do you know how many people die from being hit by a drunk driver or how many people ingest alcohol to a fatal intake and suffer from alcohol poisoning? Not once, have I ever known a drug treatment center dedicated strictly to Marijuana users. I wonder why that is? Because there isn't one. Meanwhile, losers check into clinic after clinic searching for ways to minus their addiction to Alcohol. I'm sure you'll look in the back of your depleted narrow mind and search for the most obvious excuse you can comprehend. Marijuana is illegal. Yes, that's in America and that's now. Alcohol went through a time of prohibition. Did it not,statistics do not lie. It's impossible to over dose from Marijuana. Do you have any clue as to what the withdraw symptoms are? Alcohol can lead to a severe chemical dependency. Marijuana is only psychological. For instance, it takes the average user of Marijuana 72 hours to recover from all adverse effects experienced while using it one time. Do you know how long it takes the average drinker to recover from use of alcohol? Years, and years. They never fully recover. THC leaves the body within 22-43 days. alcohol lingers on as it henders digestion, liver failure, pancreas malfunctions, chemical dependencies, jaundice, and makes you gain weight. I'd rather put a joint to my mouth then go out and by hit by a drunk driver or check into the nearest meadows due to chemical dependency and liver troubles. Check your facts. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

However my friends that drink alcohol (I dont drink either) often become nasty and violent.
<BR>

<BR>
Can I just finally say that if I wasnt such a health fanatic and had to choose something nasty to put into my body (alocohol, heroin, cigarettes, etc.) then it'd be pot.
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks for listening<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It doesn't tell you that it replaced your critical thinking skills with the naive wonder of a hyperactive six year old. It doesn't tell you that your present hyperalert awareness of your surroundings is not the same thing as being attentive and awake. And most importantly, it doesn't tell you that when you become an habitual user its effects persist even when you are not longer jiffed. <br>

Any drug that takes two to four weeks of non-usage before you even realize what a mess you were is seriously evil. Drugs that deceive are not to be trusted.

<BR>

3 years ago I started smoking hash. I don�t like to be high, so it is small amounts I smoke, just to be able to sleep 7-8 hours at night. It have changed my life.
<BR>
 
<BR>
I am now able to participate in our daily life in the family. I can now do the shopping, help the children with schoolwork, play with the children (I have 4) and read books again, and not just be in the bed the most of the day.
<BR>

<BR>
I still have pain, and I am still tired, but not as much as before.

Should I not be allowed to smoke hash ?

Four Score and Twenty years Ago
<BR>
When the corn was growing high
<BR>
I was smoking pot like a slashdot moderator
<BR>
and watching the clouds roll by.
<BR>

<BR>
How many years was that again?
<BR>
I wish I could count to ten?
<BR>
The magic of pot has addled my brain.
<BR>
But, hey!
<BR>
With that magic of pot, maybe to ten, count I can!
<BR>

<BR>
They tell me pot is wrong
<BR>
but I am strong
<BR>
They tell me pot makes sweet baby jesus cry
<BR>
But hard as they try
<BR>
Take away my dignity, they can't!
<BR>

<BR>
Sweet sweet pot!
<BR>
Sweet sweet pain!
<BR>
The way I see it smoking pot is to everyone's gain

<BR>

<BR>
And for me it was really hard to see the effects of pot smoking in my life, initially. My grades DID NOT go down, I came first in both of my university degree 's (I gave up pot before exams mind you), I was maintaining meaningful relationships (or so I thought) despite having to hide the extent of my pot smoking at times. But deep down I knew that I was not reaching my full potential, I think all pot smokers know this - it still makes me a little sad to think about.
<BR>

<BR>
Over time, pot gradually eroded the true meaningful relationships I had with those close to me and most importantly, it eroded my relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
<BR>

<BR>
The day I decided to quit was truly one of the defining and great moments of my life.
<BR>

<BR>
I was a pot smoker for over 6 years. I could NOT have quit pot by myself at that stage, no way, it was too hard [1]. After a while pot smoking really embeds itself in all parts of your life. I have read about heroin addicts who have found it harder to give up their pot habit than their heroin habit!
<BR>

<BR>
The reason why pot is so dangerous and addictive is similar to the cigarette addiction - it's the dis/association game. You begin to disassociate with non pot smoking friends as your habit gets worse. You gradually associate pot with all different parts of your lifestyle (smoking after meals, after coffee, after/before sex, before watching favourite TV shows or movies, smoking as a means to catch up with "friends" etc) and before you know it you are enslaved to the drug. It truly is a "lifestyle drug" - you are dedicating your lifestyle to pot.
<BR>

<BR>
But the good news is that you can turn it all around!! The physical effects of pot (including lung damage) are nearly 100% reversible if you give up in time. I am now as fit and healthy as I have ever been. The social aspect is the real hard part - this is where I needed God's help.
<BR>

<BR>
Don't be surprised to find that you can't beat the pot addiction by yourself - I sure couldn't. But the good news is that all you have to do is honestly ask God for help. He will gladly give you the power and wisdom to remove the addiction from your life ... you just need to be sincere.
<BR>

<BR>
God bless,
<BR>

[1] Quitting was not easy -- make no illusions about it. I had the most vivid, sometimes horrible dreams for months. My body spewed out all the toxins that "hydro" had introduced, I was violently ill at times. I had to redefine my social groups. But was it worth it - YES!!!!! :)

And, well, I didn't read the whole article, but I read a few posts here, and had to respond. I already know why cannabis is good.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
First of all, to know anything about Marijuana, you MUST experience the plant while it is living. The cannabis flower must be one of the most intricate flowers that exists. Examine one with a loupe for optimal clarity and magnification.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Smell the plant. You won't have to try. Depending on the variety, you'll notice the purity and healthful nature of it's smell. Watch it, if you have the time you'll see several bugs including worms (caterpillar looking little buggers), ants and a variety or two of tiny beetles. They love this plant.  
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Okay, now that you've truly experienced the plant, you realize that it's just a plant. Most of the time this is what one receives, (cured of course) when a purchase is made. Generally there is no processing involved. 
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Now, smoke it or put it in tea or brownies. I find that many inexperienced smokers or people who 'smoked it once, but it just made me hungry and tired' heads usually were too stoned their first times to realize that they were communicating more effectively and honestly when they smoked (granted everyone's different, and if your a paranoid person, you'll have to get past that.)
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Now, marijuana is a truth serum to a certain extent. And I don't mean a lingual truth serum. I mean that it's an indicator of purity, health, and symbolic and social truths.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
For example, when you smoke, and eat or drink something truly nasty (coca cola for instance) you know that it's nasty, unnatural stuff. 
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
I'm always motivated to drink fruit juices and take my vitamins (okay I'm a health nut vegetarian anyway) and sometimes take a run.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
I think moderation is key with marijuana or any drug. If you decide to flip out about that, well, consider for a moment that recent research shows that there are receptors in our bodies that were built to receive cannabinoids. More work needs to be done, but it looks like our body actually has the ability to Produce cannabinoids.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Anyway, the point I was about to make is that everything is a drug. TV, food, prozac, coffee, jimson weed, they're all drugs.  How you use them should be your choice. Yes, I believe it is true that some people have addictive personalities, and they may learn the hard way, but on the other hand the reason most of those people try drugs in the first place is because of their taboo nature. 
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Smoke it, eat it, drink it. It's organic (hopefully), all natural and good for you.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Happy New Years, now let's get back to changing the world, kids!

<BR>
Then a year later i started again, soon returning to the every day habit. Some things mentioned in the article are true, it does decieve you. But i did have a job during those years and i did have a social life, so calling weed worse than heroin is rediculous. Heroin will kill you and drive you to steal or even kill to get money. I never committed a crime to get money. I got some debts though, but a lot of people have debts.
<BR>
Anyway, it started to get a bit expensive and i didn't feel good about myself to be dependant on a substance to feel comfortable, plus it messes with your charisma, turning you into a dull person.
<BR>
So i quit. Wasn't too hard, i got nervous and upset or about 2 weeks and then it went back to normal. Now it's been more than 6 months and i never missed it once.
<BR>

<BR>
Weed can, and in the case of every day use, will mess with your motivation, willpower and self-judgement. But calling it worse than heroin, cocaine and other hard drugs is really dumb. Those are drugs that will ruin your life, i know a guy who has smoked weed daily for over 25 years and he might be a weird man but he has a decent life.

No it isn't. In fact, you know it isn't, that's why you have no evidence to support your statement.

<i>"Even a little stoned is still stoned"</i>
This is also true of alcohol. I.e. even a little drunk is still drunk.

The same is true of drunk people.

They are a bigger minority than pot-heads. Unless you have some statistics to show otherwise.

Only if you are stupid and don't know what it's affects are. In exactly the same way that alcohol tells stupid people "oh, it'll be okay to drive" or "hey, go and chat up that ugly woman".

Have you ever noticed that nearly all people who are against marijuana have never tried it? N.B. I didn't say I wasn't against it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Well, they've dropped out of school.

Yeah, pot's harmless.  It doesn't cause brain damage.  You can probably smoke the highest quality shit on a daily basis and you still won't have to sell your ass to get your next fix.
<BR>

<BR>
But its insidiousness lies in these same facts.  You might not get brain damage from the weed, but you're not turning into a genius by sitting around and playing GameCube or whatever the latest waste of consumerist time/money is.  What pot is most guilty of though, is simply being boring.  Personally, I can't fucking stand sitting around, getting baked, and doing stoner activities.  What a bore.  Stoners always have this cliquish mindset too, like people are either "cool" or not by whether or not they get baked daily.  It's so funny to watch them flail and fail at almost everything they do, convinced that they're so suave and no one can tell when they're baked, which trust me, we ALWAYS can.
<BR>

<BR>
I smoked every day for six years.  When I stopped shortly after my 23rd b-day, I found that my life improved DRAMATICALLY (insomnia went away, got a good job/hot girlfriend, started developing myself intellectually, etc.)  All my friends who are still stoners are extremely depressed and have NOTHING going on.  They're out of shape, can't get a date to save their lives, etc.  But yet somehow when I suggest they stop toking up daily, they invariably reply that they can't do that or they'd get "depressed!"  Go figure.  
<BR>

<BR>
At least drugs like coke, E, and ketamine get boring and cost a lot, so after a month of heavy use most of us are like 'Fuck!  This is too expensive, and ain't that much fun anymore.  THink I'll go back to using this shit once every couple of months."  Whereas every pothead I know is bored off their ass with smoking weed, yet they STILL can't stop because they're just trapped in the "stoner lifestyle" and it's so readily available.  It might not lead to utter destitution like crack/heroin addiction, but for those of you who are under 25 and smoking weed every day, don't be surprised to wake up in complete loserdom in five years.  Stop now.

Of course I don't know every fucking person in the world who smokes.  But I have known several hundred, from all around the world, and am qualified enough to make generalizations about them.

You're probably eighteen years old or so.  Write back to me when you're near thirty and please give me an update on how successful your little friends are who are still toking up every day.  And while you're at it, spend some time around very successful people (and that doesn't mean people who make $60k/yr doing some Cisco networking or whatever - I'm talking about PhD's and M.D.'s.)  I'm sure you'll find just as high a concentration of weed-smokers there as you will at a Phish show.  Duh.    
<BR>

<BR>
Of COURSE there's successful people who smoke weed.  But my point is, BY AND LARGE, it's a detrimental thing.  And MOST people go through a stage where they smoke every single day, despite the fact that EVERYONE says "oh, I'll just do it on the weekends/every once in a while" when they first start doing it.  That was the whole point of the article, that MJ's "benevolence" is what leads to chronic habitual use.  
<BR>

<BR>
With that being said, if you feel like getting baked every day and playing GameCube is like, totally kick-ass, dude, go right ahead with your little lifestyle.  Just don't come complaining about how unfair the world is when you're 27.  Also, one thing I really get sick of is loser potheads who fail their drug tests and then whine about how unfair it is.  I've had a half dozen piss tests in my life, most when I was using tons of drugs.  You generally know weeks in advance if you're going to have one, and if you're unemployed and looking for a job and you can't stop, in all honesty I probably wouldn't want you in a real job anyway.  It's so funny how some potheads just choose this or that line of "work" (i.e., pizza delivery) so they can remain baked on the job.  Yeah, that's the dream lifestyle right there.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Regardless as to whether you like drugs or not, it is not your place, nor the governments, to dictate what people do to themselves.
<BR>

<BR>
Marijuana does certainly not tell you that you are a better person for smoking it (I think you've been hanging around with the wrong crowd, or reading some very strange material). In fact, if you knew anything about narcotics, you'd be able to appreciate the fact that drugs do different things to different people. That's not even mentioning the different forms of weed there are out there and the variety of affects they can have on an individual.
<BR>

<BR>
What are these quotes your refer to? They seem rather random to me and I can make stuff up too. Hell, I don't need to make anything up because I can tell you from my own experience and that of friends and family.
<BR>

<BR>
No one has ever died from smoking cannabis. Having said that, the most dangerous aspects of the plant is its cancer element (but this comes from burning any substance).
<BR>

<BR>
As for addiction, it is impossible to become physically addicted to weed (or even cocaine for that matter). The body does not become dependent on it. What can happen is a mental addiction, but anything can become a "drug" in this manner, from TV to sex.
<BR>

<BR>
So please get out of the stone age and stop refering to "typical drug posts" (you have no idea what the person behind the text is like, nor do you know if they have, are or even will smoke). If this is just an evil substance, then why are more and more countries takign a less harsh view on it?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Putting aside the argument that it isn't the government's place to tell people what they can and cannot do to themselves, even though governments do that frequently in both more and less advanced societies, let's focus on the 'what people do to themselves' part of your statement. People who smoke marijuana and other drugs are not just affecting themselves.

<i>No one has ever died from smoking cannabis.</i><BR><BR> Back at ya with the accusation of making stuff up, Skippy. Do you actually know this for a fact? A few years ago, in researching sudden cardiac death, I came across several accounts of people who'd died of cardiac arrest while smoking weed. That these people had genetic heart defects is secondary - smoking weed triggered their cardiac arrests and was thus directly responsible for their deaths. Are you going to argue that these unfortunates only make up 0.5% of the population and thus the the risk of death via weed is negligible? I wouldn't go there. Death is death, whether it's 3 people or 3 million.

What about the tobacco industry, alcohol or even the model or music industry? The crap surrounding these is incredible (the latter I have experience with, and it would shock you to know what's going on). The legal issues are created by nanny-states and their feel that their population is incapable of thinking for themselves (legalisation and slapping a tax on it would produce a nice little income and still keep prices lower than at the moment). The stuff is going to get smoked, whether you like it or not. Perhaps if the western world wasn't so obsessed on banning it to the Third World such suffering wouldn't occur. We could then grow the plant legally on our own shores and thus reducing the pressures placed on other countries.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;That these people had genetic heart defects is secondary - smoking weed triggered their cardiac arrests and was thus directly responsible for their deaths.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>

<BR>
No its not secondary. For example, WW1 wasn't caused by the assassination of the Archduke, it was a whole host of other issues boiling over. I guess for simple people they'll take the first thing that's thrown at them. Even so, if you want to blame anyone then its the people themselves for acting so stupid. If you're educated in narcotics and taught to use them responsibly they'd be no problem. Someone who has breathing problems is hardly likely to smoke (they do its their problem), or someone with an allergic reaction to a food is unlikely to comsume food. Sigh.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, I hope you don't drive or consume any electrical energy, because those are just as selfish acts. You're actions are result in untold suffering around the world.

<BR>

<BR>
I see you like to be pedantic. People die from all sorts of things, form pillows to peanuts (go and have a look around, you'd be amazed at how many weird deaths there are per year). This is no reason to ban them or moan about the risks. You show me evidence that someone has died as a direct result of cannabis (and nothing from some anti-weed group, we all no people with a mission love to make crap up). You won't find any.

Yes, I do drive and I do consume electricity. I do so with the knowledge that I am consuming resources and thus attempt to keep my consumption to a necessary minimum. And I do so knowing that energy and oil are vital to the growth and expansion of the world economy. How is the production of illegal drugs contributing to the world economy? <BR><BR>

OK, and people are going to kill people, rob people and beat people up, whether I like it or not. That doesn't make it legal, or ethical. When will drug users (including pot smokers) realize that they are doing something wrong and that they need to take responsibility for their actions? <BR><BR>

Marijuana is not hard to quit if you have the desire to do so.  Even some of the heaviest smokers will only expirience irritability, boredom, and other minor mood related side effects without the drug.  There are rare incidences where someone who really wants to quit would need rehabilitation.
<BR>

<BR>
For most people the marijuana does not effect their lives.  Despite what this article claims, small amounts of marijuana do not impair you're thought activty to a great degree, nor do you get "cashed" eyes and a clown grin.  People who are not accustomed to the drug get these sort of symptoms, but as people become accustomed to it (similar to how people who don't drink easily get to become foolish off small amounts of alcohol) no one would be the wiser.
<BR>

<BR>
It can be abused, like anything can be.  I don't think there's anything to expound upon in that matter.
<BR>

<BR>
As far as quitting and learning what the drug has done may be true to some, but the few, for sure.  I am a habitual user, and have quit for long periods, (months, and in one case, years) and I didn't feel any different whatsoever.  When I don't smoke it's typically by choice.  I just don't feel like smoking.  I don't feel a draw or longing for the drug when it's not available.  Perhaps some small dissapointment if I'm stressed, or want some for a social occasion, but definitely not anything near what someone with a physical withdrawal would have.  Not much more than a passing amount of dissapointment.
<BR>

<BR>
There is so much misconception and propoganda to this drug even to this day.  If you read the history on the drug, you'll learn that it's illegality stemmed from racial discrimination in the early part of the century.  It was not made illegal from any rigorous testing, simply racial propaganda drove the present condition regarding illegality.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope that this was at least somewhat informational and helpful to dispel some long lived misconception about marijuana.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Most of the people I know smoke pot and on the whole it is nothing compared to how many people get fucked up by tobacco and alcohol. Potheads don't fight or commit crimes other than smoking up. Crackheads and alcoholics do. Pot does not make people stupid either. I got straight As in highschool during a period when i smoked a lot of pot and i got one of the largest scholarships in my class.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is the first time i've been to this website, and my first impression was that it was full of crap.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not one of those idiots that make a statement and can't back it up, so i'm going to tell you the reasons why...
<BR>

<BR>
1. The first article I read was by someone called T Reginald Gibbons whom wrote an article called
<BR>
 "Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?". This guy was telling people that "Flash" was a hacking program, but Flash is actually a piece of software
<BR>
used on the internet to make games,cartoons and web pages, everything this person said was WRONG he is the stupidest person in the world and should be shot.
<BR>

<BR>
2. On the home page I found an article by a mother who decided not to allow any of her six children to go to college even though she had been saving up for years so she could. This decision was made mostly because her mates daughter went to MIT and turned into a goth.
<BR>
she banned her children from seeing this girl, who they'd grown up with, this is what she says
<BR>

<BR>
"The strident complaints of my three daughters told me I had made the correct decision. Already they had begun to be drawn to her attitude of teenage rebellion. It felt good to know that I had acted in time to save them. "
<BR>

<BR>
she is a fuckin stupid bitch, of course they're going to complain they've been mates with her all their lives.
<BR>

<BR>
3. The article by zikzak "Why marijuana is the worst drug"
<BR>

<BR>
This guy and some others who've posted comments seem to think that weed is worse than cigarettes, alcohol and hard drugs such as heroin and crack.
<BR>

<BR>
All of those drugs will kill you if you take too much, except weed which is the ONE OF THE SAFEST DRUGS IN THE WORLD LEGAL OR ILLEGAL.
<BR>

<BR>
All of these people are treating their personal opinions as fact, which they are not. One person even wrote a comment not only claiming alcohol is everyones best friend and giving the impression that you should drink it all the time, but he also named all the types of alcholic drinks he could remember, saying that they where all American and i'm pretty sure Vodka is Russian and whiskey is Scottish(possibly irish). I can't remember what else he said.
<BR>

<BR>
And I should know. I can smoke an ounce in less than 6 hours. 
<BR>

<BR>
PS&gt; I'm British.

Alcohol kills countless people each year, as do cigarettes. I see your point on pot, because it seems harmless is really the worst of all, but could it really be that pot seems harmless because, used in moderation, it is virtually harmless? You can't make a point on marijuana by belittling the effects of alcohol and cigarettes. Both are very dangerous drugs. Tobacco is more addictive than heroine. I don't even like tobacco, but I still smoke one every now and then because I used to smoke them and I still crave it for some reason. Pot is very different in that way. The 'addiction' of pot is purely psychological and can be easily overcome. All you have to do is WANT to quit. I guess my point is that your argument is not a valid one simply because you act as if alcohol and tobacco are not a big deal, and that pot is somehow the real menace. It's lunacy. No one has ever died from smoking pot. No one ever will. At least pot doesn't contain chemicals added by a factory to make it addictive. Your argument almost works, but you may need to rethink a thing or two.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
