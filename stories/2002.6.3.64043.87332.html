      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><b>Counter-Strike</b>
<p>
The first thing I noticed after downloading the game <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net">Counter Strike</a> was a shocking realization that it was obviously trying to feed off the September 11th tragedy. <A HREF="http://www.jackinworld.com">Players</a> pose as terrorists and are encouraged to bomb a variety of targets such as aircraft, houses and crates as well as killing hostages. The game starts with each player choosing <A HREF="http://www.circuspenis.com">real life weapons</a> from a giant armory, then <A HREF="http://www.solosex.org">players</a> are encouraged to use <A HREF="http://www.bigcocksex.com">these weapons</a> on unarmed hostages and on each other. Like <A HREF="http://goatse.cx">me</a>, you are probably thinking that doesn't sound much of a game. Any normal person would agree but the types who play "Counter Strike" are not normal.<dt>
The truth is that the average Counter-Strike <A HREF="http://www.masturbation-pictures.net">player</a> is affected by the same low self-esteem and social unpopularity that your typical geek is. They try to make up for their inadequacies and lack of real life courage by fantasizing that they are macho counter terrorists with <A HREF="http://www.universe-of-cock.com/boyswithbigdicks">big guns</a>. Another personality trait of a "Counter Strike" <A HREF="http://www.amateurmasturbation.com">player</a> is a preference to  cheat. On many of my information collecting sessions I overheard <A HREF="http://www.real.com">players</a> talking about such cheats as "aimbots", "wallhacks" and "<A HREF="http://www.johninman.com">camping</a>". In fact, I learnt that cheating is so widespread and encouraged in "Counter Strike" that the new release of the game includes a command which lets <A HREF="http://www.voyeurweb.com">players see through walls.</a><dt>
In allowing these sort of impressionable and immature people to play such violent games you are simply breeding killers. Several times I witnessed players getting excited when one of them got a "<A HREF="http://www.bukakee.com">headshot</a>", it was probably sexual excitement. I was rather surprised at the number of people who play this <A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/kd2001/vommie/vom_pics.htm">sick game online</a>. I estimate there must be about 10,000 people around the world who play this game regularly. That's 10,000 people who enjoy using <A HREF="http://www.standardfireworks.com">firearms</a> and have <A HREF="http://www.potatoerror.com">serious mental instabilities</a>. One of these people could be living on <i>your</i> street. Already, <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com/world/story/383925p-3059366c.html">one of these sickos has gone on a killing spree</a> and unless something is done, I expect there to be more such tragedies in the future. Its all very well when our <A HREF="http://whitehouse.gov">government</a> spends time and money shutting down terrorist training camps in Afghanistan, but they should also be looking closer to home and shutting down these online training camps for killers.
<p>
<p>
<b>Quake I</b>
<p>
There are actually three different games of <a href="http://www.planetquake.com">Quake</a> making up a triology. I tried "Quake 1" first and was appalled at the Satanic theme of the game. The walls in the level are often covered in blood and demonic images are abundant. So you can imagine the type of twisted people who play this game. At one point, one of the players even asked me if I wanted to join his "clan". I didn't ask what that implied but I wouldn't be surprised if they meet up in real life to perform rituals or animal sacrifices. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed and moved hastily on to "Quake 2". <dt>
<p>
<p>
<b>Quake II</b>
<p>
I was rather relieved to find that "Quake 2" had dropped the evil theme of its predecessor and had instead taken on a alien vs marine sci-fi feel. No doubt people had reacted badly to the demonic theme of "Quake 1" and it hadn't sold well. Another triumpth of the consumer over evil. But despite the new theme, I found "Quake 2" to be worrying in several other ways. An online game of "Quake 2" simply involves running around and shooting people. A normal person wouldn't consider playing such a repetitive and mindlessly violent game, but the regulars of "Quake 2" play it for hours on end. In fact I saw one server up as late as 3am!<dt>
The game simulates blood and gore with a variety of sick features such as corpses which can be blown apart. Many of the players of "Quake 2" are simply psychopaths. They don't seem to have any feelings for the killings which they are simulating. They discuss "Frakking" (killing) each other like a normal person would discuss the weather. Even so, there seems to be a level of honor in "Quake 2", often players will resort to fighting each other with the <a href="http://www.quake2.com/q2wfaq/faq_railgun.html">Rail gun</a> which is apparently a skilled weapon to use and is treated with respect. Also it is considered bad form to shoot people before they have weapons and unlike "Counter Strike" players, "Quake" players are totally against cheating. If anyone uses the "Camping" cheat (hiding somewhere so your gun is more powerful) all the players shout insults at them and even "kick" them off the server. You might have noticed that the "Quake" community has its own made up language - words like "Frakking" (explained above), "lag" (an insult they shout at each other) and "lpb" (low ping bastard).<dt>
Another positive point is that the game doesn't have realistic weapons and so unlike "Counter Strike" players, the players of "Quake 2" might get the urge to kill in real life but they wouldn't know how.<dt>
<p>
<p>
<b>Quake III</b>
<p>
I finally moved on to "Quake 3". I had to do my research on a friend's computer because mine couldn't do the graphics. I found there isn't much to talk about "Quake 3". It's exactly the same as "Quake 2" but with more realistic blood and violence. I was a bit worried to see that the satanic theme from "Quake 1" was back again. Although not as pronounced this time, it was still clearly making a comeback. I imagine the game makers are trying to sneak their demonic messages back into their games bit by bit.
<p>
<p>
<b>Red Alert</b>
<p>
Unlike "Counter Strike" and "Quake", <a href="http://www.redalert1.co.uk/Home~1.htm">Red Alert</a> isnt 3D and involves you building and commanding an army of tanks and soldiers into battle against your opponent. The game takes part during the cold war and gives the player two sides to choose from - Allies and Soviets. However, unlike a good tactical board game, "Red Alert" instead bases itself on violence and the familiar blood and gore. Dead soldiers don't simply disappear from the playing field but instead explode into a fountain of blood. I found, that unlike normal people, the players of Red Alert are devoid of human compassion and feeling. A normal person would build up a defensive position for his army and value the lives of his troops. However, "Red Alert" players simply refer to their loyal soldiers as "units" and quite often, drive large groups of them into a suicide attack. These sort of people are no different from the battlefield commanders of World War I. 
<p>
<p>
<b>Worrying Finding</b>
<p>
As I watched the players typing to each other, I saw a reference to another game called "JDoom". Wanting to learn more I downloaded "JDoom". The graphics were bad because it is such an old game but the content was even worse.
The demonic theme was stronger than ever and after 10 minutes I quit and uninstalled it. It turns out that "JDoom" is even older than "Quake" and was quite popular when it came out. It was at this point that I realized what this implied - that "JDoom" is the cause of the masses of violent games we see today. But who made "JDoom"? It turns out that a company called <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">ID software</a> made it. Now for the startling revelation. I also found out that "ID software" made "Quake" too! Coincidence? Furthermore I was told by one player that "Counter Strike" was actually made from "Quake 1" by running its engine! This is turning out to be quite a conspiracy.<dt>
More investigation revealed a name - "John Carmak". I had heard the name mentioned before while in a "Quake 3" game. Online game players seem to worship this man like a god and ive found out why! He is the programmer for "ID Software", he wrote "Quake" and "JDoom" and his work lead to "Counter Strike". No wonder all these violent people worship him in their sick way.
<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
While us normal people have always ignored online games, my findings show that we now need to take immediate action against this menace. The violent and twisted nature of these games are no doubt corrupting the minds of unsuspecting children and teenagers. I propose that we don't necessarily need to ban the games but instead should change their content to be more suitable. We should first ask John Carmak to change the content of the games he makes to be less violent. In fact we could ask him to put more educational information into games too. <dt>
I propose that "Counter Strike" could simply be redesigned into a paintballing game. Instead of bullets, players would fire paintballs at each other. When players get hit with paint they would disappear off the screen until the next round. Warning labels should be placed on the menu screen telling players that it isn't real life. The terrorist theme should also be removed. It's not good to allow players to roleplay as terrorists as that sort of thing could imprint on impressionable minds and make teenagers think that terrorism is okay. I think the same paintballing idea could be applied to "Quake" as well as removing the demonic imagery.<dt>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Of course I am no fan of electronic games, particularly for children, but there are some significant errors and overstatements in this diary entry. Children are much better off learning to set a fence post, or identify the non-poisonous varieties of wild mushrooms as opposed to fiddling around in front of a glorified television, learning no useful skills. Which brings up the following:<BR><BR>

<i>violent games you are simply breeding killers.</i><BR><BR>

There is far more to becoming a killer than playing a game. For instance, you might have to stand up and move about once in a while. Your muscles will need to be conditioned enough to actually steady a rifle at your shoulder instead of tapping away at a device meant for tapping. You'll also need to learn a bit about your chosen weapon system outside of the programmed abilities it has in an electronic world. <BR><BR>

Evidence of this can be seen in the numerous school shootings perpetrated by young people. Most of these foolish 'gamers' shoot up their school with military surplus hardball ammunition. Hardball certainly has its place, namely being resistant to the elements and its ability to penetrate, but it is not <a href="http://www.firearmstactical.com/hwfe.htm">designed to kill</a>, only maim. Had these young people chooses a <a href="http://www.snipercentral.com/223.htm">quality hunting bullet</a> their kill ratio would have been much higher. Coupled with a willing media that refers to these sorts of attacks as 'well planned', children continue to receive the impression that electronic games prepare them for battle. It certainly breeds a strong bloodlust but it certainly does little for their tactical skills.<BR><BR>

<i>each player choosing real life weapons from a giant armory</i><BR><BR>

No. This is an electronic game. No real life weapons are available. Rea life weapons are made of steel, polymers, or some other similar material. Electronic game weapons are made of small dots of light.<BR><BR>

Regardless, I agree with your assertion that all young people would do well to steer themselves clear of electronic games.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Take a trip to the gaming society, find out more about the attitudes, humor and interpretations of these games. You obviously have just been watching in-game talks. Geeks and social misfits, yes.. about 60% of them. The rest, no. They have lives, they have friends, oh yes - they can be <b>adults</b> also.
<br><br>
Oh yes, about those insults:
<br><br>
"lag" (an insult they shout at each other)
<b>ROTFLMFAO</b>! Lag is where someone has a high ping, and is having a slow response to the server they are connected too. It's a way of informing team members that they have it.
<br><br>
"Frakking" (killing)
<b>BWUHAH!</b> It's actually fragging, and it just means that you're going around killing people in-game, not an insult.
<br><br>
"lpb" (low ping bastard)
<b>*DIES*</b> This is a joke, not an insult. A low ping is good, it is a way of saying "i'm jealous", with humor.
<br><br>
You obviously have no idea what goes on in the gaming society these days, and do not know who plays them. Visit <a href="http://www.3dactionplanet.com">3DActionPlanet</a> - Then, look through all the hosted game sites. Click on forums, you'll find out a lot more about the gaming society.
<br><br>
An example would be <a href="http://www.planetwolfenstein.com">PlanetWolfenstein</a> - This game was based from the 1993 version, Wolfenstein 3d. This game is the prequel. It's setting is WW2, and in MultiPlayer, you go around doing objectives against your opposition - a team work game, like Counter Strike. Although you can't buy weapons, you get what is set in your class (Soldier, Medic, Engineer and Lieutenant). Check out the forums (General Discussion and Off-Topic), and you'll find that there are a lot more mature teenagers, and adults there than I expect you would.
<br><br>
Your review also includes many sexual references. Sad, immature. <b>Aren't</b> you an adult? Go learn some more about online gaming before you try discriminating any games or societies, this attempt has failed.<br><br><BR><BR></FONT></td>

Skulls.. eh. You could of started this thread 10 years ago, or even 20. There have been <b>hundreds</b> of games before this featuring Satanic themes, battling as a good guy against the "<i>forces of evil</i>", why bitch about it now? Because it's online?
<br><br>
So what if it features something religious? It's a game, games can be anything and are only there for playing with imagination. I don't care if you're any religion, as <b>no</b> games have any laws against them stating that they can't use any religious material. They shouldn't have to label their work either.
<br><br>
If you're so against games with violence, then don't play them. It's the same with movies, if it has a rating over Universal, don't watch it. But don't interrupt other's entertainment. And no, they won't grow up to go and kill people thinking they're a virtual marine, or what not. Too many people blame games for in-real-life violence nowadays, and they have no good excuses for it.<br><br>
The games that you talk of, Counter-Strike, Quake, all have labels on them featuring age restrictions. It's up to the Parents to make sure the kids don't get ahold of it, unless the Parents know and trust their kids.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"Hummer"'s post broke the law by reproducing PotatoError's article in its entirety. Although "fair use" allows excerpts from copyrighted material to be reproduced for certain purposes, it does not extend to allowing an entire article to be reproduced on a website in this manner. "Hummer" broke the law.<BR><BR>
Furthermore, "Hummer" didn't even have the decency to attribute the source of the article. Not that attributing the article would have made his actions any less illegal or reprehensible, but it would have been polite.<BR><BR>

Children are not supposed to be reading Adequacy.org, they are not our intended audience. Our "News for Grown-Ups" slogan should make this obvious. You have a particularly bizarre set of values if you believe that theft of copyrighted material is more acceptable than having hyperlinks to "adult" websites. If you don't like adult material, don't follow the hyperlinks!

The games have violent themes, I'll give you that one, but they don't preach violence on others; they merely encourage hand-eye coordination and problem solving skills.
