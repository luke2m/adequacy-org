      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Why can't computer hobbyists just call themselves "computer hobbyists?"  Or "programmers?"  Or, if they need a word that describes a general fix-it mindset, why not use any of the words that were around before computers were invented?  How about "handyman," "dabbler," or "inventor?"  Or the somewhat older "tinker?"  Prefixes such as "cyber-" or "compu-" could easily be attached if the old words aren't sufficiently modern.
<p>
What's wrong with the word "coder?"  Would it be too difficult to describe oneself as a "sysadmin,"
if that is what one does?  Are the terms "technician" or "repairman" too demeaning, regardless of their accuracy?  What about "geek?"  If it's the positive term that so many computer hobbyists make it out to be, then why not use it?
<p>
What's wrong with the term "IT professional?"  How about "computer expert?"  The term is good enough for countless grandmothers, so why don't their precocious progeny use it?
<p>
Who would be hurt if computer hobbyists started referring to computer criminals as "hackers?"  Would it be too difficult to explain to a layman that one's friend or associate is, e.g., a "techie," and not a misanthropic, criminal <i>hacker</i>?
<p>
Could it be that the connotation of illicit activity is actually part of what <i>attracts</i> computer hobbyists to the word "hacker?"  Do they wish to take on a roguish, independent, no-need-for-rules air, but balk at being labelled criminal?  Are computer hobbyists simply unwilling to reap what they sow?       <br><br></div>

Your right, we linux/unix users ARE too good for your standard OS, because we like a challenge, not something that will hold your dick for you.

Perhaps you are unaware but UNIX has been about for <i>neigh</i> on 30 years. Quite a long time in which to get a decent desktop environment together.<BR><BR>
Our software used to support 8 Unix variants along with Windows up untill 4 years ago when our customers switched to NT.<BR><BR>
No one wanted a UNIX build any more, they wanted the latest jazzy GUI that NT provided, and the cost of maintaining a compatible GUI, and graphics, APIs across multiple platforms was too expensive when people only wanted one variant.<BR><BR>
Our users BTW are highly skilled computer users who have a job to do. What they don't want or need is a fight with the OS.<BR><BR>
<i>Linux lets the experienced computer user really get to know their system unlike windows and aol who are for the computer illiterate.</i><BR><BR>
If by 'experienced computer user' you mean 'hide our pr0n surfing from your parents' then you may be right.<BR><BR>

Absolutely. He who controls the language, and all that. I mean, just look at Colin Powell. Now, he doesn't want you to pronounce his name, "Colin", like every other Colin on the planet. No, he has a special "Cohlen" for you. It is things like this that make him powerful. Do you think a "Kevin", or "David" could be Secretary of State? Not unless they pronounce themselves <i>key-van</i> or <i>dee-ayvihd</i>.

But of course. Geeks are not as important as hackers. They haven't reached the same level of skill, of discipline, of ethical standards of hackers. Geeks are destined to fail if they remain who they are. They must work hard to achieve entry to hackerdom. Only hackers can make our nation proud.

<BR><BR>
Don't you understand?  "Hacker" means "computer criminal" to a great many people, and not all of them are "mindless idiots," either.  Some people have understood "hacker" to mean "computer criminal" for over twenty years now.
<BR><BR>
Black folk have never changed the color of their skin to suit language, but they have, in fact, changed the language they use to describe themselves when older terms took on offensive meanings.  Do you know any black folk who still call themselves "negroes" or "colored people?"  Have you not met black folk who would prefer you call them "African American" rather than "black?"  Do you know anyone of asian descent who prefers to be called "oriental?"
<BR><BR>
Of course not.  When words describing minorities take on negative associations in society at large, and the negative associations can not be shouted down, the old language is abandoned in favor of new terms.
<BR><BR>
Why can't computer hobbyists just adopt a new, positive term?  Would it hurt anyone if you were to refer to yourself as a "techie?"
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, aren't you hurting yourself, and many other computer hobbyists, by refusing to accept an unfortunate shift in language, and move on?
<BR><BR>
In refusing to accept this battle as lost, are you not damaging the larger fight to remove the unfounded taint of criminality from innocent computer hobbyists?
<BR><BR>
What is it about the word "hacker" that is so precious that it must be retained, regardless of the consequences?  Must you sacrifice the reputations of your peers in order to retain a title that is itself no more than a frivolous neologism, one whose negative connotations go back as far as its widespread use?
<BR><BR>
Again, I have a great deal of trouble understanding this tenacity absent a perverse attraction to the very negative associations under scrutiny.<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
Too fuzzy and uncertain meaning. A "techie" can be a bored phone repairman with a voltmeter and the knowledge that doesn't go over the troubleshooting checklist, with more interest in what will be for dinner than in the technology.
<BR><BR>
<i>Why not "geek?"</i>
<BR><BR>
Similar reason.
<BR><BR>
We have a word with accurate definition. Why to change it all of sudden?
<BR><BR>
<i>Don't you understand? "Hacker" means "computer criminal" to a great many people, and not all of them are "mindless idiots," either.</i>
<BR><BR>
If anyone equals "hacker" with "criminal", s/he is an idiot.
<BR><BR>
<i>Some people have understood "hacker" to mean "computer criminal" for over twenty years now.</i>
<BR><BR>
These people apparently tend to resist closer understanding for quite long time.
<BR><BR>
<i>Why can't computer hobbyists just adopt a new, positive term? Would it hurt anyone if you were to refer to yourself as a "techie?"</i>
<BR><BR>
Because it is a cat-and-mouse game. We have the power, the raw unadulterated power of the technology, the arcane knowledge that goes beyond the understanding of the Commons. We are the witches of the modern times. Naturally we are chased and ostracized. If we will change the name, all we will get is maybe 5 years until we will have to change it again. This way we at least have a stable, well-defined term, backed with decades of history. The term respected within our rank. Nothing other matters, compromises not accepted.
<BR><BR>
<i>On the other hand, aren't you hurting yourself, and many other computer hobbyists, by refusing to accept an unfortunate shift in language, and move on?</i>
<BR><BR>
Why? And where to move on to? Only to "move on" again after a while? Bah.
<BR><BR>
<i>In refusing to accept this battle as lost, are you not damaging the larger fight to remove the unfounded taint of criminality from innocent computer hobbyists?</i>
<BR><BR>
If they don't want to be criminalized, they shouldn't tinker with anything beyond the understanding of Joe Sixpack and his opinion-shaping version Jim Journalist.
<BR><BR>
<i>What is it about the word "hacker" that is so precious that it must be retained, regardless of the consequences?</i>
<BR><BR>
Maybe not allowing Joe Sixpacks of the world to talk into our matters, including the terminology?
<BR><BR>
Without us, the technology wouldn't be by far as developed as it is now. How many of fundamental breakthroughs - including the personal computer itself - was born in the minds of hackers? Now we are expected to follow the wishes of the ones who don't know what key is the "any" key they have to press to continue?
<BR><BR>
You are barking at a wrong tree. Go complain to the media.
<BR><BR>
Blind obedience was never my strong side. I will not bow down. Regardless of the consequences.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">How on earth can you possibly claim that taking on a new term won't work until you've tried it?  Sure, black Americans have gone through quite a few labels, but their history is much more problematic than that of the computer hobbyist.
<BR><BR>
Asians and asian-americans haven't had to do much in the way of changing language since "oriental" was phased out, have they?  Why on earth do you think computer hobbyists would have a harder time of it?  And how can you possibly justify the refusal to make an honest effort?
<BR><BR>
Actually, I was most struck by this part of your comment, which I found quite revealing:
<BR><BR>  
<cite>"We have the power, the raw unadulterated power of the technology, the arcane knowledge that goes beyond the understanding of the Commons. We are the witches of the modern times. Naturally we are chased and ostracized."</cite>
<BR><BR>
This sort of rhetoric betrays exactly the sort of attraction to malicious connotations that I've been talking about.  To some degree, your use of the word "hacker" mirrors the positive use of the word "nigger" amongst black Americans, in that it suggests that the user is to be feared, confirms an oppressed status, and suggests an understanding of the world unavailable to outsiders.  
<BR><BR>
But just as the word "nigger" is also used in a negative manner amongst black Americans, so too is the word "hacker" used with a negative intent amongst computer professionals.  To pretend otherwise becomes an admission of obliviousness to the culture that one is presuming to speak for.
<BR><BR>
Your attitude toward the press, and the public at large, is interestingly contradictory.  On the one hand, you find them beneath you, but on the other hand, you care very much about the words they use to describe you.  
<BR><BR>
If this were a case exactly analagous to that of the word "nigger," I would expect you to simply wish to see the word expunged from public discourse entirely, but it would appear that our analogy breaks down here.
<BR><BR>
You want, instead, to reverse the commonly understood meaning of the word "hacker" to fit your own agenda.  It is not enough for you to use it amongst your peers in a certain way; instead, you care very much about what "Joe Sixpack" and "Jim Journalist" think, and you want them to love you, and use your special sacred word in a loving manner.  Meanwhile, you continue to attack their intelligence in the most savage, callous manner imaginable.
<BR><BR>
I do not suggest that you engage in "blind obedience" or "bow down."  I suggest instead that you offer or accept new terms in order to help others understand you, or more precisely, your innocent peers.  You, Mad Geek, have already admitted in this forum to criminal computer activity.  
<BR><BR>
This brings up a very different and more sinister motive.  You may very well want to keep the term "hacker" in flux, thereby enabling you to use the protestations of innocents as an unwitting shield to hide your disregard for the law, and more importantly, the principles behind it.  
<BR><BR>
I had not considered the possibility of this sort of despicable manipulation in my musings on the strange continuing attachment of computer hobbyists to the word "hacker," but now that I think about it, it makes all too much sense.  Innocents are too often the pawns of those who would use their innocence as a shield.

Assuming USA copyright laws, doesn't the badging of copyright on your statement implicitly allow critical review of the content of the copyrighted statement, negating your explicit restriction on annotated rebuttal commentary? Also, there seems a certain level of arguable ambiguity associated with the wording of your signature. When you specify "You may not reproduce this comment[...]" couldn't that be read to indicate that the statement of copyright only covers the copyright statement itself?

<BR><BR>Often when people hear techie the enivion someone that is trying (whether or not it's true) to sound like they have more knowledge than they do.  Besides techie is a term thrown around by people who generally like to "mess" with their computers.  Whether they know all about what they are doing is another matter.  It's a very general term that can describe someone that likes to simply upgrade their computer.  This is far from someone who designs circuit boards.

<BR><BR>As for geek, that's just silly.  It's pretty much always been a slang term used to insult someone who's nerdy, or goofy.  It's a stereotype.  There's enough problems with stereotypes on this sight alone attributed with linux users, hackers and geeks.  They are not one in the same no matter what some people might think.

<BR><BR><b>Don't you understand? "Hacker" means "computer criminal" to a great many people, and not all of them are "mindless idiots," either. Some people have understood "hacker" to mean "computer criminal" for over twenty years now.</b>

<BR><BR>Not quite twenty years.  However, it's good to see that at least one person admits that it meant something different.  For 30 years it was a positive term.  It would be just like trying to choose another word like geek or techie.  It would likely take twenty years for people to forget the origins of the owrd and accept it as something positive.  Hacker is our word and we want it back.  I don't see the problem with that.  Most people in the IT sector haven't forgotten the original meaning.  This is especially true of many engineers (software/hardware).  It's the Dopey Joe Schmo computer user that only knows how to surf the web, send email, and download porn that we need to educate.  In a way way we're kind of like (I hate to say it) Republicans.  It's a trickle down effect.  However, with the increase in OSS or just alternatives to the past more and more people are coming around.  I mean look above at your original comment.  With some real education it didn't take long for you to admit that it once meant something positive.

<BR><BR><b>Do you know any black folk who still call themselves "negroes" or "colored people?" Have you not met black folk who would prefer you call them "African American" rather than "black?" Do you know anyone of asian descent who prefers to be called "oriental?"</b>

<BR><BR>Depends.  Old black people still refer to themselves as color folk.  It's not really dependent on time.  Quite a few southern blacks still say colored and negro.  Hell, negro is still used in many parts of America.  I haven't met a black person yet that was offended being called black.  It would also depend on what part of Asia you were referring to.  Asia as in China?  I don't think people from eastern Russi would like to be called oriental.  Besides if you were to look up oriental you will notice it's actually an offensive term originally used for the Chinese.  Of course Americans are rather silly when it comes to murdering language.  Take an American Taco and throw a bunch of salsa on it and the call it a Fiesta Taco.  Gimme a break.

<BR><BR><b>Why can't computer hobbyists just adopt a new, positive term? Would it hurt anyone if you were to refer to yourself as a "techie?"</b>

<BR><BR>Already covered that

<BR><BR><b>On the other hand, aren't you hurting yourself, and many other computer hobbyists, by refusing to accept an unfortunate shift in language, and move on?</b>

<BR><BR>As I have mentioned before most people recognize an understand the difference if you take just a little time to explain it to them.  As long as you don't waste your time just before they sit down and watch pieces of shit like "Hacker" or "Max Knight: Ultra Spy" written by idiot that don't bother looking up anything in a dictionary.  I found <a href="http://www.geocities.com/shift_back/crap/ssum.html">this</a> why looking up computer movie stuff.  It makes a lot of sense.

<BR><BR><b>Must you sacrifice the reputations of your peers in order to retain a title that is itself no more than a frivolous neologism, one whose negative connotations go back as far as its widespread use?</b>

<BR><BR>Most of my peers (computer "geeks" and non) understand the difference.  However, they and even I sometimes use hacker (in the mailicious sense) just to make sure that Joe Scmo understands what we mean.  We only do this to clarify.  We also make sure to use cracker an crack more often.  Watch the news sometime like ABC World New Now.  Notcie how they use both terms.  I am not totally against someone using the word hacker when referring to someone that breaks into networks.  However, they need to make sure that they claify it.  What pisses me off is this believe that <i>all</i> hackers are criminals and only want to break the law.

<BR><BR>Hackers aren't all bad.  Just like any line of work people can use their skills for "evil"  If a gang of locksmiths were caught using their knowledge of lock picking, would you make the same claims?  Would you post [all] locksmiths=criminals?

<BR><BR>People hear words like hacker and reverse engineeing and they think all kinds of silliy stuff.  Reverse engineering isn't illegal.  Hell, MS recently praised OSS programmer who reverse engineer software to allow Xbox gamers to play online.  Microsoft's service won't be available for another year.  Reverse engineering is not bad.  It doesn't involve stealing source code and stealing files.  If you had a program and you liked how it worked but thought it had too much unnecessary, buggy, crap that hogged resources you might think you could do a better job.  You write your own version but make it work and look similar but do it the way you think it should be done.  Cracking registration codes isn't reverse engineering.  That's warez.

<BR><BR>Note:  Please do not confuse reverse engineering with the temporarily quiet battle between Apple and Microsoft.

<BR><BR><b>Again, I have a great deal of trouble understanding this tenacity absent a perverse attraction to the very negative associations under scrutiny.</b>

<BR><BR>A lot of people believe white=racist.  Why is it that no one has ever suggested we stop using that term?<BR><BR>

So "techie" and "hacker" are no different in that sense, either-- both can be abused.  Techie, however, is never used to describe computer criminals.
<BR><BR>
The earliest reference to a computer hacker in the mainstream press that I've been able to dig up was on April 13, 1983, in the Wall Street Journal.  It is reasonable to assume that the term was in use for some time before that, perhaps a year or so.  What is notable is that in that first reference to computer hackers in the mainstream press, the term had <i>already</i> taken on the meaning of "one who breaks into computer systems."  While articles <i>later</i> that year did, in fact, note the earlier, more benign meaning, no <i>earlier</i> reference can be found in which the word refers to innocent gadget enthusiasts, technical tinkerers, or backyard engineers.
<BR><BR>
There are, of course, earlier references in the mainstream press to amateurs called "hackers."  Amateur <i>golfers</i>.  Why shouldn't we restore this "original" meaning, rather than the one that computer hobbyists are so strangely attached to?  Let "hackers" be an antiquated term for amateur golfers.  Let "crackers" be an antiquated, derrogatory term for white people.  Find a new term for computer criminals.  And a new term for computer enthusiasts.
<BR><BR>
In telling me that I admit "hacker" once meant something positive, are you not yourself admitting that it now means something negative?  Why can't you start there, and move on?  How is your nostalgia for the benign electronics "hacker" of the 1950s any better than the nostalgia of a Republican for the "family values" of the same era?
<BR><BR>
You can claim that the word "hacker" is only used in a negative sense by computer enthusiasts when they wish to "clarify" something to "Joe Scmo [sic]," but I've heard it used negatively by computer professionals in other ways.  I've heard it used to describe young programmers who display little skill or forethought, and I've heard it used to refer to people who break into systems, used in the company soley of people with considerable knowledge of computers.  That these negative meanings persist even after "education" has taken place is rather telling.  The fact that you don't acknowledge this in your post is also interesting.
<BR><BR>
There is another aspect of the problem, one that will not go away no matter how much a computer enthusiast might want it to.  The fact of the matter is that people who are interested in committing computer crime, but not particularly interested in programming or otherwise devising systems, refer to themselves as hackers.  You can call them "script kiddies" until you are blue in the face, but when they are interviewed, they will invariably describe themselves as "hackers."  
<BR><BR>
If you really want to take back the term "hacker," then you will have to take it away from the criminals, not from the press.  you must convince script kiddies to call themselves script kiddies.  You must persuade the crackers to start calling themselves crackers.  Frankly, I don't think this will ever happen.  
<BR><BR>
Once criminals have a noble-sounding name for their activities, they'll never revert to a derrogatory word.  The wise course, I think, will be to let the criminals have the word "hacker," and let that word gather an ever more negative image as innocent computer enthusiasts adopt a new term for themselves, such as "techie," or "computer enthusiast," or whatever else may come.

It wasn't really a term but more of a simple description.  It was used to define licensing which allow the licensee to freely use the code.  It wasn't widely used but it was used.  Nobody really thought of it as being a term or a definition of how they were licensing it.  That's what Eric Raymond did.  He combined the term with the definition as well as further defining it.  Open source project have been around for quite some.  You do have to admit that is much easier than "licensing which allows  for access to and modification of the source code".  He further defined what it meant.  Before it was just a term that was kicked around.  Nobody really thought about it but used it.

Will they ever understand that it's free as in freedom not cost, and open source but still falls under the terms of the license agreement?<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>I cut my hands up in the dark and just sat there and bled, while the whole world fell apart inside of my head.<BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
You're saying that "open source" was used now and then before it became "official."
<BR><BR>
And the word "techie" is currently used now and then to describe computer enthusiasts, as are many other "unofficial" terms.
<BR><BR>
The old term for "open source" had problems, because it caused confusion and gave some people the wrong idea.

Open source and free software are terms that are still used despite the fact that they cause confusion among the uniformed.  The term open source is not there to replace free software.  Just because it's open source doesn't make it free (as in freedom not cost).  
<BR>

<BR>
Take Microsoft's Shared Source Program.  It makes its source code open to only a slect few developers (only after they drown them in nondisclosure forms).  However, the source code is not free to modify or use.  Hell it's not even open for peer review.  So the fact is, is that open source and free software are related terms but you cannot use one to mean the other in every instance.
<BR>

<BR>
So what if hacker has changed meanings?  Hackers will continue to use the term because those who know its meaning will understand.  If someone raises an issue with a hacker then most are happy to explain in a civilized manner.  They will explain to them the what a hacker is and how they differ from malicious hackers which they refer to as crackers.
<BR>

<BR>
You see it's the ability to figure things out for yourself.  They used to teach this in schools.  Forget prayer let's get this concept back in the calssroom.  Armed with the knowledge to figure out the difference they can know that there a hackers that benefit technology and "hackers" that use their skills for "evil".  So next time they hear a news report about hackers they will know that it's only a small group of hackers.  Hopefully, those not "in the know" will stop believing that all hackers = criminals.
<BR>

<BR>
Why should hackers change for everyone else?  We know what it means and we'll continue to use it.  If we have to explain the difference to some people along the way and explain to them we're not out to take down the internet (which we help create) that's fine.  Hopefully, they know a few things so it's a little easier.  I mean mentioned the command prompt and idiots like elenchos, osm and Yoshi throw a fit.
<BR>

<BR>
How fast after we were to pick a new name do you think it would catch on?  And how fast would the uniformed start thing [insert name here] were bad?  They likely think it was just another trendy word drummed up by the media.  There have been some attempts to change the name.  Unfortunately, they're usually products of dumbass screenwriters (or at least sound like it) or skriptkiddies.  Geeks, CodeWarriors, and TurboNerd to name a few.
<BR>

<BR>
We're fine with it.  The one real thing that pisses off hackers are obviously uneducated paranoid people that like to make bogus claims like "I am a professional, so I'm smarter than you and you're a criminal" simply because you talk about something they obviously know nothing about.  I'm sorry but it's rather difficult to believe that when you claim to be running WindowsXP on a token ring network (which W2K and XP don't support) running IIS (which isn't even included with either version of XP nor will it run) and uitilizing the XP firewall because you're afraid someone is going to 404 you by stealing you iMac address and IP tokens.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>I cut my hands up in the dark and just sat there and bled, while the whole world fell apart inside of my head.<BR></FONT></td>

With some real education you would know that once 'girl' meant 'boy', and that 'appeasement' once had no negative connotations. The truth is that, and whine as much as you like, the primary usage of 'hacker' outside of <a href="http://slashdot.org/">geekdome</a> means 'one engaged in illegal attacks on computer networks'.<BR><BR>

What is the most important ability of the hackers in comparison with the Plebs is the ability to learn new things. If there is something needed to master, and it is at least basically interesting, it will be mastered. The actual status of hackers' knowledge is ever-changing and growing.
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
Why MCSE? You know that its true meaning is "Must Call Someone Experienced"? Why are you all obsessed with certifications and paper sheets in cheap plastic frames?
<BR><BR>
<i>People who work tech support and consider themselves hackers aren't hackers of any definition. The correct term is nerd. You are a nerd.</i>
<BR><BR>
What about the hackers who serve as techsupport because of being available - who aren't primarily techsupport and only double as one because of that it is necessary at the moment? Been there, done that, currently on the way out of it.

I am strongly against the idea of limiting access to the Net.
<BR><BR>
However, I'm in favour of a scheme that would make people eligible for technical support services. A sort of elementary courses with basic certification. Making sure that its holder knows what a network cable is, and that a printer will work better when it is switched on. And that "My Internet doesn't work" isn't a proper error report.
<BR><BR>
Even without the certification, you could call techsupport. However, you will be on the mercy of the support person who then will have no other obligation to help you than their own good will. Eventually you would have to pay higher fees.

I don't think people should get free tech support whenever they buy a computer.  Well, at least not 3-5 years.  They should get it for a little while the be forced to buy [insert program] for Dummies or that Video Professor they always run commercials for.  I wonder why I have to sit on hold with tech support because they sent me the wrong system.  Here's a funny story I read recently:

<blockquote>We maintain a 24 hour, 800 number call desk for our maintenance contract customers, a very expensive undertaking. Non-contract customers can call as well, but our per-call maintenance charge is $250/hour, with a minimum of three hours. If you only call us occasionally, it's a lot cheaper than a contract, but it's clearly designed to discourage trivial calls.

<BR><BR>In 1996 a per-call customer called. "What does MSDOS stand for?" she asked. We told her. Her firm paid the $750 bill without demur.</blockquote>

Think of how many people would be forced to read a few books or take some simple course if tech support charged for every call.  Sure maybe not $250/hour but some fee.

<BR><BR>The community college only 10-15 minuted from my house offers free courses.  People can go there and take free classes on how to use Windows and MS Office.  Beyond tech support, think of how much time and money you and schools could save because they would have to spend so much time starting with the basics.

<li> Tech support is a marketing device. It exists so companies can sell computers to people who don't know how to use them. If they didn't have tech support, they would lose sales. That's why tech support's purpose is to answer "stupid" questions. <BR><BR>

<li> I don't care how you think people should learn about computers. Neither do they. Neither I nor they think they should have to take their first steps in computing without someone to help them. Your opinion of how they should learn is immaterial.<BR><BR>

<li> So-called "hackers" are just deluded nerds, who have convinced themselves that knowing a lot about computers makes them immeasurably better than their fellow man. Mechanics generally know more about cars than nerds know about computers, but mechanics have never tried to pull this elitist crap on anyone. That's why we like mechanics better, and why they are respected, while "hackers" are not.<BR><BR>

<li> You are a nerd. If you were a hacker, you'd break into computers. That's the simple truth. Even if your definition of hacker was the correct one, you'd still be a nerd. You just are.

<BR><BR> Let me explain something to you. The public has never been interested in boring programmers, no matter what you call yourselves. They were briefly interested in computer hackers, who hacked into computers. The attempt by boring programmers in the late nineties to "reclaim" the term is simply an attempt to steal what remains of the cachet surrounding the word. You are attempting to usurp the (somewhat dubious) prestige won by others, in a cynical effort to enhance your own image.

For your information a Hacker is someone who tests security defenses on a a system to see if they are breakable then tells the operator of the system that there are holes in it and shows what he did to do it. These vigilante's are Hackers (aka White-hat hackers)
<BR>

<BR>
The people who you so eledgedly call hackers are really called Crackers (or Black-Hat hackers), those are the "Cyber-terrorists" that has every Reginald Gibbons in the world hiding in churches behind a crucifix.

With all this mouthing off you do about crackers I wouldnt be surprised if one comes after YOU and YOUR family.

Hell, I built my system from scratch, I've got an AMD, and I built my mom a system with an AMD. Does that make us BOTH hackers? How about my 60 year old Grandma, and my friend's 75 year old Grandma? Are they both hackers because they chose a higher quality processor than the one you're running? NO. But you aren't going to see it this way, because you're an idiot.

You, DMG are the reason people need to pass a test to own a computer. You, and your kind, are the reason they have warning labels on everything. Warning on an iron: Do not iron clothes while wearing them. Was that you?

Next time you open your pie hole I suggest you do a little something called research. Oh, and I don't mean reading through ast garbage by T, Reginold Gibbons, because he seems to know about as much as you do. Go to a library, check out a few books on basic computer operation, and maybe the dummies guide to the internet. Then, after you have at least some idea of what you're talking about, go ahead and argue with those of us that do this stuff for a living.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

not true.
<BR>

<BR>
"while playing computer games"
<BR>
A good hobby...more worthwhile than watching sport games IMO.
<BR>

<BR>
"reading comics"
<BR>
Oh please
<BR>

<BR>
"and occasionally going to college when it suits you"
<BR>
Cuz college is shite and they cant teach anything worthwhile about computers - therefore they arent educating US so why turn up?
<BR>

<BR>
"Go on then, I challenge to "take down the world"."
<BR>
If all of us got pissed enough we would..but you 'challenging' us to do it isnt what I mean...maybe if the US government attempts to pass internet licensing or whatever weird schemes people on this site have come up with then yes, we would get pissed. Even then we arent hostile enough to want to "take down the world".

Then don't wonder when after asking what key is the "any key" you get told that it is the power button, that after the Windows rot caused your computer to crash twice per hour you get your disk formatted and all data erased (because the site policy specified in the manual said you have to backup your data daily - and it's not our worry you trashed the manual), and that your new password will be 60 characters long. And no, you will not be permitted to run [whatever third-party program] on your machine, it is against the security policies (which don't apply so strictly to ie. the secretary, but she is cuter than you and instead of bossing us around at 3 am she bribes us with cups of coffee). Oh - I'd forget - the scheduled server downtime is planned to two hours before your deadline, which you are doomed to miss.

Nervous because they are familiar with both the cluelessness of the users and the unreliability of the Modern Technology - and know who will have to clean up after the excrement will inevitably hit the fan again.

Take Mr. T. Reginold Gibbon's bit on "How To Tell If Your Son Is A Hacker". Anyone that had any shred of intelligence would be wondering if it was a joke, or if he was serious. If I need to explain why then you can include yourself with the rest of the "Intelligent" adequacy readers.

How about (My favorite) the AMD sweatshops? That one is even worse than Mr. Gibbon's story. I have to admit that I get a kick out of you guys though. Story after story, post after post, and reply after reply you people never cease to make me laugh.

You have no power whatsoever. So long as you want a paycheck you will do what you are told. Almost anyone could "master" computers, its not exactly rocket science. Indeed computer science hardly justifies being called "science" at all.<BR><BR>
Face facts, you 'hackers' are no more indispensible than the guy who refills the vending machines. OK, so I couldn't do it myself, but if he gets all uppity with ideas above his station about how "powerful" he is, he <i>will</i> be replaced in a hurry by someone who understands their position in the heirarchy.<BR><BR>

<BR>

<BR>
No tvs, shite cars, no wrist watches, no mobile phones, no hi-fi's, no credit cards, you get the idea.
<BR>

<BR>
Hospitals would suck - no life support systems, no machines such as x-ray - no advanced treatments.
<BR>

<BR>
Police - no national criminal databases, no fingerprint databases, no DNA databases, ie no databases. No CCTV networks and just 1900s communications. In fact the whole country would have just 1900s communications. No fax machines, no internet. 
<BR>

<BR>
Airports at their current size cant cope without computers. I imagine your bank also has a heavy dependancy on computers. Also supermarkets.
<BR>

<BR>
As for National Security - the military would have no decent aircraft, no smart bombs, basically anything with a microchip is out. You'd have to rely on ground troops. Nukes would never have been invented - and we know that they singlehandedly prevented world war III between the US and Soviet Union. 
<BR>

<BR>
We havent even touched on the implications involved in computer design. Buildings, Aircraft, Cars, all are designed and using computers - development in these areas would suffer if computers didnt exist.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes you could survive without all these things but the standard of living would greatly decline and many people would probably die.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes food is more important for survival and therefore you could argue that farms have a higher importance. But you could argue that farms today are a creation of technology - ie they are not the same as the old farms. Pesticides, Fertilisers, Farm machinery, all products of technology. Without techies there would not be this technology and farms would not be able to sustain the population.
<BR>

<BR>
Technology shapes and controls society and in turn society shapes and controls technology. Its a balanced cycle like nature. If someone has the power of technology they have the power to control society.

How many products, companies and protocols have gone by the wayside in spite of the best efforts of geeks to support and promote them?  If geeks had any power, where is Loki?  Whither VA Software?  Geeks are obviously not the ones calling the shots in technology.
<BR><BR>
And outside of technology, in the legislature for example, do geeks call the tune?  As far as UTICA, the DMCA, and every other tech law, they call the exact opposite of the outcome.  If geeks had any say, would Jar Jar Binks exist?  Would "Final Fantasy" have flopped?  Would they still be allowing so many low-wage Indian programmers into the US?  Name any topic you want, and if there is a geek position on that topic, then that position is invariably the loser.

You should write more on this subject, however.  I think it would be instructive to hear why you delude yourself into thinking you and your kind are so important.
