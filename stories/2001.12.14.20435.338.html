But I have a problem. You see, I am quite <a href="http://www.rockthevote.org">politically aware</a>, and I have always considered myself to be a <a href="http://www.vso.org.uk/campaign/tourism/report.htm">responsible tourist</a>.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">The obvious question to ask is "Why don't you go and ski in Europe then ? There are some pretty good flight deals at the moment <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1578000/1578128.stm">due to the Sept 11th terrorist attack</a>, and God knows our airlines could <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1588000/1588278.stm">use the business</a>".<p>
This is what a unintelligent co-worker of mine actually said to me the other day while we discussed my dilemma by the water cooler.<p>
Obviously anyone who asks a question such as this is not very well versed in politics or history but I am, which is why the vacation issue is such a sensitive one for me.<p>
I really want to go and sample the delights of Europe's top ski resorts. They are widely regarded by skiing experts as being the best in the world.  They offer vast interlinked ski areas combined with top-notch upscale European fine dining, and a vibrant night life. The Austrians can out-party even the most boisterous frat-boys, and the Germans can drink just about anyone under the table.
<p>
What I don't want to do is to support racist, fascist regimes or people. I believe my government has <a href="http://www.igc.org/solidarity/atc/92Chomsky.html">done enough of that on my behalf</a> already without me adding to the oppression. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/angryindian/pagegenocide.html">Our European forefathers committed genocide</a> in order to found our <a href="http://www.pfaw.org">great nation</a> I like to think that by being aware of racism and being very choosy about where I spend my dollers, I can do my bit to make amends for all the atrocities America has inflicted on many different races throughout the years. As a white man, I realise that I am racist by definition, but this will not prevent me from challenging my own racism on a daily basis, and trying to live responsibly, attempting to make personal reparations in whatever way I can, no matter how small or trivial it may seem to others.<p>
<p>
But enough about my personal struggle against racism, I was explaining my dilemma. The five countries I mentioned as potential ski vacation destinations all seem to have problems with racism. I am not comfortable with any of them.
Lets take each country in turn
<p><li>Austria.<br>
Austria's main claim to fame is that it was the birthplace of Herr <a href="http://www.hitler.org/">Adolf Hitler</a>. More recently however <a href="http://www.jewsweek.com/politics/005.htm">Kurt Waldheim</a> has hit the headlines for his Nazi connections and currently <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/news961111.html">Jorg Haider</a> is singing the praises of Naziism. What more can be said of the country that <a href="http://www.violetbooks.com/REVIEWS/jas-bettauer.html">welcomed Hitler with open arms</a> in 1938, managed to <a href="http://home.carolina.rr.com/wormold/austria/history-15.htm">avoid the full-scale de-Nazification program</a> which the Allies applied to Germany, and then proceeded to elect Nazis and Fascists as though there were nothing wrong with it. I think you will agree I cannot go here and keep a clear conscience.

<p><li>France<br>
Home of <a href="http://www.adl.org/international/LePen-1-introduction.html">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, <a href="http://www.kzpg.com/Lib/Broadcasts/News/I/Imm/msg00048.html">Brigit Bardot</a>, and the <a href="http://www.socialismtoday.org/37/france37.html">Front Nationale</a>. The recent death of Fran�ois Mitterand (who was once decorated  by Vichy Nazi collaborator leader Philippe Petain) does nothing to reduce the endemic racism and anti-semetism of the French nation. I cannot bring myself to vacation in this right wing racist haven.

<p><li>Switzerland<br>
Those <a href="http://www.artcult.com/banks.htm">thieving</a> profiteering scumbags who <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.com/swiss/index.cfm">stole Jewish gold and lied about it</a>. What more can be said ? The Swiss were dealing with the Nazis for a long time. Why would I want to go there and spend my American dollars which are representative of freedom and democracy, something these Nazis will never understand ? So Switzerland is out. Which is a pity, since I hear that Zermatt has some particularly good runs.
<p><li>Germany<br>
Germany the country's name will forever be synonymous with Naziism. Nothing more needs to be said. I won't forget. Nor will the history books.
<p><li>Italy<br>
Now we come to perhaps the most difficult problem. Italy was never really a Nazi state, its leader <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/mussolini-fascism.html">Mussolini</a> was a fascist true enough, but it wasn't him who initiated the holocaust. We all know whose idea that was (Hint: he was Austrian). However there are many disturbing right wing trends in modern Italy. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4265360,00.html">Silvio Berlusconi</a> has gone on the record as saying <i>"We should be conscious of the superiority of our civilisation, which consists of a value system that has given people widespread prosperity in those countries that embrace it, and guarantees respect for human rights and religion. This respect certainly does not exist in the Islamic countries"</i>. These are hardly the words of someone who respects diversity, are they ? And then there is the Nothern League led by <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1321000/1321804.stm">Umberto Bossi</a>. It seems you cannot turn a corner in modern Europe without running into a xenophobic racist neo-fascist. Which is a pity because Italy has some great skiing, and some even better food and drink.
<p><li>The European Union<br>
Let us Americans hold no illusions about the EU. What appears to us to be a friendly bunch of people who speak lots of different languages, and are prone to getting over excited at football matches is actually the nascent fourth reich.
<p> 
<a href="http://www.europeansinglecurrency.com/euro%20and%20USE.htm">The common European currency was Hitler's idea</a>, which is why <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1619000/1619645.stm">older Austrians are finding it easy to use</a>. The worrying thing for me is that the Europeans (all 300 million of them) seem to be joining together as a super-state. And that super-state is using a Nazi currency model, and appears to aspire to take over the USAs #1 nation status. And they are about the only nation on God's Earth that could pull it off. You only have to think about their <a href="http://www.porsche.de">superior</a> <a href="http://www.bmw.de">automobiles</a> and <a href="http://www.aeg-home.co.uk">domestic</a> <a href="http://www.miele.co.uk">appliances</a> to see that they are a force to be reckoned with. And let us not forget that were it not for <a href="http://www.pascal-theatre.com/pascmoonreview.htm">Werner Von Braun</a> and all the other Nazi scientists America would not be #1 nation today. It seems that fascism and Naziism are on the rise again in Europe but this time there is a thin veneer of respectability to make it all seem palatable to the masses. I do not want my vacation dollars going toward funding a fascist super-state with ambitions of world domination...<p>

<p>
Which brings me back to my problem.
Obviously now is a really good time to travel because flights are so cheap, but I don't want to give my support to any racist or neo-fascist governments. It seems I am out of luck.
<p>
I've tried looking further afield, but the only other places I have come up with are <a href="http://www.interknowledge.com/chile/portillo/portpkg.htm">Chile</a> and <a href="http://www.nevis-range.co.uk/ski.shtml">Scotland</a>. <a href="http://www.lalkar.demon.co.uk/issues/contents/mar2000/pinochet.htm">Chile</a> does not seem to have a history of racism per-se, but then Chile seems to have played host to a whole load of <a href="http://www.lakota.clara.net/derechos/victims.htm">human rights abuses</a> which ensure it will never gain a place on my skiing itinerary.<p>
Scotland looks to be OK, but the men there all seem to be slightly effeminate, <a href="http://www.campbellkilts.demon.co.uk/">wearing dresses</a> and '<a href="http://www.glenlachart.co.uk/TheStar/issue6/caber.htm">Tossing</a>' their '<a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/games/Caber.html">Cabers</a>'. Whilst I respect diversity as much as the next man, I have no wish to spend my vacation in close proximity to a bunch of <a href="http://www.crieff-highland-games.co.uk/caber.html">effeminate 'tossers'</a>. So <a href="http://www.tourism.wales.gov.uk">Scotland</a> is out of the question.<p>
Which leaves me with nowhere to go. I guess I could stay in the USA, but to tell the truth, I'm getting a bit sick of all the <a href="http://www.heyrick.co.uk/ricksworld/thoughts/20010926.html">mindless knee-jerk flag waving</a> and <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/oct2001/war-o09.shtml">gung-ho militarism</a> that characterises our nation at the moment.<p>
I need to get away from it all. All this <a href="http://www.thamus.org/News/us/real_americansattack.html">fake patriotism</a> and the strain of '<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines01/0928-04.htm">watching what I say</a>' is starting to tell on me. <p>
Do any of our more politically aware readers have any suggestions as to where I might go ? Somewhere where I can sleep easy in the knowledge that I am not supporting some nasty political regime, and preferably somewhere where I can get a cheap deal on a flight!      <br><br></div>

If you really must get out of US territory, then an expedition to Antarctica with your helicopter can be organized that ought to be just as rewarding as an Alaskan foray.

Not equipped? Perhaps more a case of women by and large not wanting to

<BR>
case of why those few women who do wish to pursue such a manly occupation
<BR>
should be precluded from doing so. It could be a case of you affirming

truly brainwashed by the American media. 
<BR>

<BR>
I do not live in the Americas, nor do I equate the United States with
<BR>
"America" as you so naively do. Your claim of Islam being a maven for
<BR>
"human dignity" is a joke, as as the the lectures of Bat Ye'or should
<BR>
adequately inform you (http://mypage.bluewin.ch/ameland/LecturesE.html) 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Women are not equipped for hard physical labor. That is a simple statement of fact.
<BR>

<BR>
You affirm the consequent in the same fashion as the original poster by
<BR>
presuming that all women are ill-equipped for "hard physical labor". Are
<BR>
they? I know of butch women. The criteria for being "equipped for hard
<BR>
physical labor" is obviously going to be based on one's muscular strength.
<BR>
The fact that the set of people with sufficient muscular strength is
<BR>
(almost) a subset of the set of men is merely one of the wide-ranging
<BR>
effects of testosterone.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Why is it that women play three sets of tennis and men play five ?
<BR>

<BR>
Do you see a lot of butch women playing tennis? Those that aren't butch,
<BR>
don't have the endurance more muscular men would have. Those women who 
<BR>
are butch, probably could.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Or do you really believe that men and women are physically equal ? 
<BR>

<BR>
Straw man. I never asserted that men and women are physically equal. I
<BR>
assert that the criteria for being "equipped for hard physical labor"
<BR>
includes muscular strength. Women are not necessarily precluded from
<BR>
having the sufficient muscular strength.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Its hardly surprising that the leader of a Catholic state would harbor
<BR>
anti-Islamic beliefs.
<BR>

<BR>
You never justified that Berlusconi's beliefs were "anti-Islamic"; a very
<BR>
strong case could be presented for lack of freedoms for certain groups in
<BR>
Islamic countries and hence his statement would be factual. While some of
<BR>
these freedoms may actually be slaveries (as you assert, and I can
<BR>
certainly see your point), some can't be waved away so simply (openbook:
<BR>
religious freedoms). 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Catholics and Christians have been amongst the main instigators of
<BR>
violence for at least the last 500 years. 
<BR>

<BR>
(Catholics are Christians -- I take it you've been swallowing too much
<BR>
fundamentalist rubbish recently?)
<BR>

<BR>
So precisely how did the entire Middle East fall to the Islamists? Islam
<BR>
has as much, if not more, blood on their hands than the Church, not to
<BR>
mention the Church has apologised for violent incursions, plus the fact
<BR>
that the incursions are sufficiently far in the past to demonstrate a
<BR>
change in attitude from the Church, as opposed to Islamic persecution
<BR>
occurring right now.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Islamic states do not 'blithly dismiss' religious freedoms.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, don't be daft with blanket comments like that. Which adequacy reader
<BR>
wouldn't be able to see past that transparent garbage?
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.domini.org/openbook/, although Google should yield many more
<BR>
hits should you be interested.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Indeed the main problem is the kufr women from the West who visit
<BR>
Islamic countries and then display they bodies in a most immodest way
<BR>
upsetting the local Muslims. 
<BR>

<BR>
I fail to see how Muslim outrage in these Islamic countries rebuts my
<BR>
charge of countries which blithely dismiss religions freedoms.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; If anything the non-believers are given too much freedom in Islamic states.
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.domini.org/openbook/sau20011003.htm
<BR>

<BR>
In any case, your charge of "the non-believers" reeks of religious
<BR>
fascism. Unlike immodest dress, religious freedom cannot be waved away as
<BR>
easily as you would like it to be.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; You may be aware that in Saudi Arabia, they even turn a blind eye
<BR>
to alcohol consumption (in the foregner's compounds).

Righ Here.  Oh, I'm sorry. That was rhetorical.<br>

dmg, I think you need to get in touch with your inner Russian. The Russians have had your vacation

Remember, the answer will probably involve suffering and drinking.

<i>After all, where would America be if we all mindlessly pursued our own happiness to the exclusion of everything else ?</i><BR><BR>

You ask, "how exactly am I hypocritical?"<BR><BR>

The fact that you still live in America is the first clue.  You are SO concerned with spending money in "bad" countries, yet fail to look in the geographical mirror.  Someone of your "intellect" should readily understand how "bad" America itself has become.  Perhaps your comment that I quoted illustrates your "prior knowledge" of this "paradox".<BR><BR>

In your quest to be a "good little boy", you choose to spend money only in countries that meet your "ethical" criteria.  How about everyone in the world act as "good" as you, sir?  Let's all spend our money at places that have never done something "bad".  That will teach everyone a lesson, right?<BR><BR>

It is indeed pompous to hold countries responsible for acts committed hundreds of years ago.  Your claim to never travel to Germany is justifiable, BUT taken in conjunction with all your other "holier than thou" posturing, one might "accidentally" assume that YOU yourself are quite prejudgemental, even racist.<BR><BR>

Perhaps the word bigot does fit you better, as you don't seem to actively persecute those in other countries - you just hold their nationality against them.  I guess that's not as bad, but it's not something for which you deserve a pat on the back.  Your economic stimuli won't be missed by those countries who aren't "good" enough for it.<BR><BR>

At least you show some signs of a "clue", again in your statement which I have quoted.  The United States of America, good old USA, we sure do know how to pursue happiness - but whatever happened to pursuing life and liberty?  I guess that part of America will "return" once our country is done "acting" like a superpower.<BR><BR>

An maybe, just maybe, people from other countries will decide to visit America, IN SPITE of all the bad things OUR country has done in the last hundred years.  I hope they aren't as ethically pure as DMG claims to be.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You make up 3 words which have zero meaning.
<BR>
Pure - what does this mean??? Are you talking racially or morally? (the US is neither - and neither is any other country).
<BR>

<BR>
Strong - again, what does this mean? are you talking military power or citizen mentality? The american people arent mentally stronger than any other people around the world.
<BR>

<BR>
Free - yes, of course the US is the ONLY country which is free (?). The kind of country where if I say "im going to kill the president" during a phone conversation id get the Feds knocking down my door within 12 hours. Your phones, your emails, they are all tapped. You have a bit of a secret police over there. So give me a break about free. Most western countries are as free as the US and seeing as you are about to introduce massive anti-terrorist/anti-freedom laws over there dont you think this was a bad point to pick?

I personally find it to be annoying at best and a virus at worst, it took a real effort to remove it from my friends computer when he downloaded it.  As for the rest of your comments, you are entirely mis-informed regarding hackers and computer's in general.  And hackers do not dress in any one style.  Saying you can identify a hacker by what they wear is like saying you can identify a jewish person by the size of their nose and bank account, its the worst form of prejudice facing the United States today, aside from the common prejudices regarding age.  I think thats enough heckling for one day, I look forward to debunking your future comments, they certainly give me a good laugh!

This is a post on a message board, who cares about spelling or grammar?  There is a time and a place for everything, and this is not the time for pulling out a dictionary to check every single word and sentence.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

were you?  I mean, give me a break, you have obviously never played the game, or so much as talked to someone who has.  I personally have never played it, but i know several people who do, and believe me, it is nothing more than a game! If you play the game "Battleship" does it mean you own a battleship of some kind and are training in the ways of piloting it so you can wage war against someone?

And about the comments you made regarding AMD, I truly hope someone from that company reads what you wrote, because if they do, I am sure the defamation of character lawsuit will be right down the road.  Where did you come up with this stuff?  Did you make it up, or was it a joke?  I truly want to know, when it was first posted on the message board I frequent I truly thought it was made up, until I clicked on the link to this website.  So please, enquiring minds want to know, was it a joke?  And if not, where did you get your information?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

We should be conscious of the superiority of our civilisation, which consists of a value system that has given people widespread prosperity in those countries that embrace it, and guarantees respect for human rights and religion. This respect certainly does not exist in the Islamic countries". </blockquote>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; You made a sweeping generalization based on race. In anyones book that is racism.
<BR>

<BR>
Try www.dictionary.com. I don't see anything about "sweeping
<BR>
generalisations" there. There's "Discrimination or prejudice", and there's
<BR>
the mistaken belief that race accounts for differences in "human character
<BR>
or ability", but there's nothing about "sweeping generalisations".
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; I made a spelling error. How is that racism ?
<BR>

<BR>
You could very well be seen to be "dissing" the race. It sounds
<BR>
implausible, but the point comes to mind after a newspaper I read
<BR>
misprinted a particular word relating to a certain native tribe's rituals. 
<BR>
All hell broke loose. While no prejudice -- and hence no racism -- was
<BR>
intended, it was certainly seen as racism by certain parties.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Nobody is oppressed by a spelling mistake, however the attitudes
<BR>
implicit in your statement about Norwegian women is highly oppressive.
<BR>

<BR>
(apart from the fact that I'm not the original AC)
<BR>

<BR>
How, specifically? Or will you just assert that this is the case?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Women of all races should not have to put up with your redneck attitude.
<BR>
Also, there is no such word as delegitimising,
<BR>

<BR>
I speak British English. I spell certain words with `ise' and not `ize'.
<BR>
Not everyone speaks American English. (now who's the redneck?)
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; but your opinions seem to be sexist and racist. I see no merit in them at all.
<BR>

<BR>
Apart from the fact that I wasn't the original poster, you made no
<BR>
attempt to answer to my points, preferring to sully me by blowing smoke
<BR>
and waving your hands about and call me a racist. As a person who has
<BR>
experienced racism repeatedly at school, I know perfectly well what racism
<BR>
is and what it isn't, thankyou very much.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt; And no, I never tire of the struggle to make the world a better place. 
<BR>

<BR>
A nifty trick. Paint yourself as upholding truth and justice, and pow, those
<BR>
whoe disagree with you are, by definition, anti-truth and anti-justice.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Even when the sexists and the racists dog my every step. Its called
<BR>
commitment to a cause. You should investigate it.
<BR>

<BR>
Thankyou for your insulting self-aggrandising rant implying how much
<BR>
better you are than us rednecks. The climb to the moral high ground never
<BR>
grows old for you, does it? <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Americans often overlook the fact that America is bigger than all of Europe combined. Of-course, we are also free of all the genocidal rage and horrible religious conflict that plagues the european people. Don't focus on the european owned liberal media that you may find in the North East. The people in the North East could never really break their ties to Europe and leave behind their horrible heritage.

You should be aware that just because a country birthed a genocidal killer or sorts doesn't mean that the whole place is damned.  That train of thought in and of itself is somewhat stereotyping...just because some one lives somewhere, they are bad?  History is history; are Americans evil since we once condoned slavery?  Not I, as all my relatives immigrated well after the slavery was abolished (my Great-Grandpa even came over to USA to fight with the Union).
<BR>

<BR>
Some people, you included, have this inability to look at both sides of the issue.  Take the German people: openly embraced the Nazis?  They were not only the victms of a massive propaganda campaign, they were out-and-out brainwashed by the gov't, although slowly (but surely).  The Nazis gave [and only showed] the people what they wanted/needed.  I am fully aware of how the defeated German people were still proud of their country, if not so much so for their leader.  My Grandpa can confirm this, as he was statoned in Germany before/after the defeat.
<BR>

<BR>
One thing about your problem with Italy.  What about the early Rennaisance Period?  Italy was a good country then...  You may say that two rights don't make up for a wrong, but I'm saying that evil shouldn't be the deciding factor when you judge a counrty [or anything for that matter].<BR><BR></FONT></td>

But, you say, <a href="http://www.etni.org.il/elections/whitehouse.htm">what about the War of 1812</a>?

Just like the situation in the United States with the War of Independence, <a href="http://www.canadiana.org/citm/acts/1867.html">ever since they left</a>, things have been much more peaceful.

In conclusion, Canada is the moral choice for the vacationing American!<br>

Your whole argument is totally flawed. What you're saying is that as white people we are to blame for the faults of our forefathers. Uh-uh, no. I'm certainly not. Here I am in 2001, sat typing this and I feel no guilt whatsoever. Why should i? I was born in 1984 not 1784, I wasn't even a twinkle in my Great, Great Grandfather's eye when Europeans were colonising and calving up the world. In my short life I haven't personally engaged in atrocities, uprooted indigenous people from their homes, or robbed a small and somewhat poor nation of their gold reserves and neither I suspect have you.
<BR>

<BR>
It is clear that you really don't know much about the European Union or for that matter, anywhere outside of the USA. You say that the E.U supports racism, and xenophobia. You're pretty misinformed. Organisations such as France's Front Nationale, the British National Party, and Germany's NDP hold very, very little power. In 1999 when Jorg Haider's right-wing Freiheitlichen Partei �sterreichs gained significant ground in elections the E.U swiftly imposed sanctions. Personally, I thought this was a little unfair as the Freedom Party was voted democratically by the Austrian people. 
<BR>

<BR>
Germany has the strictest anti-nazi legislation in the world! It's true, there is no Freedom of Speech clause for Germans. Utter anything remotely racist/anti-semitic online or offline and you're likely to find yourself in prison. So concered are they with their shady past, the German Government (which for the record is left-wing Socialist/Green) have made it illegal to deal in antiques from the Nazi era. The same goes for France; both countries have taken drastic action to filter out nazi memorabilia from such auction sites as Ebay, Yahoo! and QXL. In Germany, emergency legislation is currently being drafted through to ban the NDP altogether.
<BR>

<BR>
In Germany, once a bastion of anti-semitism and hatred, the people are particularly aware of their past. German youths are probably the most anti-racist and open-minded in the world (I'm well aware that this in itself is a stereotype). The vast majority of Germans are ashamed of their fascist past, and the last thing they need is clueless people like you waving the moralistic fingure.
<BR>

<BR>
In my opinion the good ol' USA is far more racist than the whole of Europe together. Whilst Europe was becoming more and more liberal, embracing multi-culturalism, blacks in the US were still oppressed, and treated as non-persons. 
<BR>

<BR>
You willfully label a whole continent of people, which is something I cannot understand. I presume you don't believe that black and white people are the same - human beings. America is home to the most hateful organisations. The birthplace of the K.K.K, and what's the deal with those militias?  By generalizing you are guilty of exactly the things you claim to hate. We are all individuals, each responsible for our own actions. I'm not responsible for the actions of my countrymen, only myself. 
<BR>

<BR>
As a European, I know exactly what I am talking about. Presumably, if Cuba, Russia or Vietnam could offer great skiing facilities it wouldn't be a problem. Communism has killed far more people than Fascism ever did - but that's not something that we're told too often. 
<BR>

<BR>
As for your "unintelligent co-worker" - there you go again. You are a comedian's dream. Let me guess; white, middle-class, grew up in privalidged suburbia, never met a black person, and totally naive. You are a hypocrit that's for sure. So scathing, and so judgemental of others. Your co-worker sounds pretty level-headed to me.

It's the "language of the people" argument. Whilst seeming reasonable in theory, in practice I think bad usage invariably becomes good usage if enough people choose to bend the rules. Is anyone REALLY happy about the proliferation from verbs to nouns, and the widespread acceptance of "irregardless" or "ain't"?

I will do you the service of dismantaling a few parts of your argument, hopefully this will satisfy you and cause you to depart post haste.
<blockquote>Organisations such as France's Front Nationale, the British National Party, and Germany's NDP hold very, very little power.</blockquote>
You would do well to pay attention to the news. Here in the UK the BNP had one of its most successful election results in for a long time (ever?). Admittedly not enough to get a seat in parliment, but the spectre of facism is far from dead and, some fear, may even be on the rise again.
<blockquote>Germany has the strictest anti-nazi legislation in the world! It's true, there is no Freedom of Speech clause for Germans [...] the German Government (which for the record is left-wing Socialist/Green)</blockquote>
Might I remind you that the USSR's ruling party called itself "communist" and in central Africa there exists a country called the "Democratic Republic of Congo".
<blockquote> I'm not responsible for the actions of my countrymen, only myself. </blockquote>
Here in the western world we are lucky enough to live in fairly liberal democracies. As such each and every one of us is directly responsible for the actions of our respective countrys and also for the state of the society within our nations. That you believe otherwise shows how truly naive you are.
<blockquote>Communism has killed far more people than Fascism ever did</blockquote>
Read my first point about the USSR. Heres a hint: There has <i>never</i> been a successful socialist revolution. They have all been crushed or morphed into a form of state capitalism (like in Soviet Russia).

They do more than just make you feel unwelcome - they <a href="http://www.hri.org/news/usa/voa/95-07-27_1.voa.html">firebomb your house.</a>  How about being Algerian in France?  There it's more subtle - Bardot just writes articles in nationally-published magazines about how all Muslims tolerate horrific cruelty to animals.  Meanwhile, your neighbours pass a petition against giving immigrants the vote.  It wasn't so long ago that the British spat on the 'Continentals,' but I notice some nauseating turncoats are quick to wrap themselves in the EU flag in order to claim some illusory high ground - "I can't be a racist, I'm a Noble European!"

Sure, I missed a few capital letters from such words as "Semitic" and "Nazi", and maybe two words were spelt incorrectly but it hardly signifies total illiteracy. It's much more likely to owe to sleep deprivation - a careless typo. Besides, I'm not quite sure what the ability to use a spell-checker actually shows in terms of grammatical prowess. Perhaps you can enlighten me?

You seem to be guilty of bad grammar.

If you had typed this is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> Word, it would have automatically capitalized your 'i'.

'for that matter' is a parenthetical expression, which means that it needs a comma both before and after it.

This comma is superfluous. When in doubt, leave it out.
<blockquote>anti-nazi legislation...no Freedom of Speech</blockquote>
While not a grammatical error, one can plainly see the contradiction inherent in this quote.

A sentence fragment AND a superfluous comma! You should win a prize.

  Get a grip on yourself buddy... there are many aspects of history and current events but you seem to know less than adequate.
<BR>
  Doesn't it sound weird to you that u accuse 15+ advanced countries of being fascist? Your logic is so flat and simple. So many different cultures down the toilet in the same sour.
<BR>
  U sound like all those guys that say americans are stupid. And it is funny coz eventhough u mean well and even though u try to be informed u still spit the same crap people's magazine and time and newsweek feed u.
<BR>
  U still believe in black and white and u still see that there are good israelis and bad racists. Maybe u should go to isreal and dress like an arab instead :q . 
<BR>
  My english sux so i will end this here.... needless to say that your opinion makes u more of a racist than the all those ppl u accuse.
<BR>
  xcuz my inadequate english but what the hell if I cant write in my own language and be heard i ll fuck any language in my way to make my point.

Americans are just jealous of the fact that Europe is the crucible of (Ancient and Modern) civilization.  You Americans can't stand the fact that Europeans are happier, healthier, (vastly) better-educated, and better-looking than you, so you resort to petty name-calling, flinging around outdated epithets like "fascist".<BR><BR>First off, Europeans are responsible for bringing civilization to most of the world.  If it wasn't for "imperialism", the citizens of most non-European countries would still be living in huts, relying on subsistence farming for survival, and praying to idols.  True, there were excesses (mostly by the Belgians, a notoriously dodgy nation) but as a rule, the export of European civilization through imperialism has improved the lives of billions of people: I don't see Mexicans going back to live like the ancient Aztecs, do you?<BR><BR>Now to address this fuss over "Fascism".  Again, Hitler and Mussolini obviously got way out of hand, but a couple of bad examples should not be allowed to delegitimize the idea of National Socialism.  National Socialists like Franco (Spain) and Salazar (Portugal) are still revered today as great leaders who saved their countries form Communism and established many valuable services (improved health care, full employment, etc.) for their nations.<BR><BR>In 2002, all of Europe (and hopefully Britain soon ^_^ )will be united under the banner of a common currency (the Euro).  I don't think it's unrealistic to predict that the Euro will displace the Dollar as the de facto international unit of exchange.  Perhaps then Europeans will be able to get back to the business of bringing civilization to the world, this time through commerce rather than armies.<BR><BR>As for you "dmg", if you want to ski, I suggest you "hit the slopes" at some American ski spot like Mammoth Mountain, where you and your pampered American friends can insult European civilization all you want.  You probably wouldn't be able to handle being away form an authentic McDonalds or K-Mart for too long anyway.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

The only nasty thing we have really done is steal the land and kill off our indegenious folks, which as your country has also done indicates you do not have a problem with that particular aspect.
<BR>

<BR>
We also speak English, not some wog language, so you have no worries there! Our government is also run by a right wing bunch of intellectual wasters, so it fits right in with the climate back home. We even support the wars against terrorism and drugs!
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, except for driving on the other side of the road, we are basically another US state ! Just with better food and no guns. We even have ski slopes, although they certainly are not as good as Europes. But hey, our surfing's a shit load better.
<BR>

<BR>
Come here to Aus - with your ethics you will fell right at home - and the beers not crap, unlike that watery shit that you yanks call beer!

<BR>

<BR>
You must be joking. But since a lot of people reading and posting on this site obviously do not get the joke, it is not funny. 
<BR>

<BR>
As for your arguments against visiting some European countries, well, you have a point about Austria and Italy, but otherwise you are very far off the mark (and since I'm assuming you are not serious, you know that. But it is obvious that some of your readers don't). Oh, and by the way, Scotland is a part of the EU, and they have skihills that are  very much smaller than the Norwegian MOUNTAINS. 
<BR>

<BR>
There is something about your dilemma that bothers me though. I'm afraid that I have not been a completely ethical tourist myself. This summer I visited a country (and spent a lot of money there) that do not respect some of the basic human rights. This country is actually one of the countries in the world that executes the most criminals, and I'm afraid it does so in a way that kills more people from some ethnic groups than others. They also execute children (under the age of 18 at the time of the crime) and mentally handicapped people, I think there can only be maybe two or three countries in the world that are guilty of that. And that's not all. This country is also the number one polluter of this, our shared, planet, and they don't seem to be planning to do anything about this.
<BR>
But hey, can't go around feeling bad about that now. I really enjoyed my vacation. San Francisco is a wonderful city.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't it we Americans, who, a couple generations ago, had to fly over there and knock the gas chamber remote out of your assy smelling European hands, and bust a cap in your sunken Nazi chests?

<BR>
first the bit about being snobby.  apparently you've never had the opportunity to see americans through the eyes of an "outsider".  you are undoubtedly the most arrogant, self centered people in the world and are usually almost completely ignorant about the "world around you", except of course "we saved europe, twice!" and now "the arabs don't like us!"
<BR>
now the bit about europeans "murdering themselves".  if i'm not very  much mistaken, there are far more murders per capita in the US than in europe.  i'm going to assume, therefore, that you're talking about "wars", of which europe has had its share.  i only need point to the american civil war to show you that your base is horseshit since that was, if i'm not mistaken, the bloodiest civil war in the western world, ever.  keep in mind that that wasn't even between two highly nationalistic countries, and one of those countries wasn't even france.
<BR>
as for americans being "superior" and europeans living "squalid little lives", please look around you.  you have the fattest population in the world, and it got that fat from people living sad little lives with less and less human interaction. tv has become the national past time.  americans live some of the saddest, petty, suburbanized lives in the world.  you concern yourself with little bullshit things like celebrities while shutting out all the things around you (the obvious exception being september 11th).  of course being for the most part ignorant of the rest of the world, you are no doubt unaware of this.  
<BR>
and what kind of a culture develops the idea that being smart is a bad thing?  american pop culture, that's what.  and i'd trade it for more or less any european culture any day.
<BR>

<BR>
as for world war 2, i have a few things to say.
<BR>
1) if america had the choice, it would have had no problem with letting germany have its way with europe.  "sod liberty, we're not getting our hands dirty again" was the general concensus.  i would describe britain's stand in that war as far more heroic than america's.  america would almost certainly pervail by sheer numbers alone, while britain stood alone against a foe of far greater military strength and kept fighting anyway, with no victory visible even in the fuzzy distance.
<BR>
2)  america was the only major industrialized nation to come out of that war "ahead".  without it, you might well not be hegemonic now.  you certainly wern't "superior" to europe, or even the british empire, at the beginning of the war, and it took the rest of the world getting the shit kicked out of it for you to plow ahead.
<BR>
so please, don't bitch to me about world war 2
<BR>
also please not that the gulags were in siberia, which is in asia, which is not in europe.  so you can shove that statement up your ass too, especially since the bulk of europe was on the front lines against the people throwing said loan takers (christ knows why the communists would throw someone in a gulag for having something as capitalist as an outstanding loan.  m'thinks you might be mixing your dictatorships together..).
<BR>

<BR>
and lets also not forget that much of your rise as an atomic and space-faring nation was due to said "sunken-chest nazi's" who were brought over and set to work for your own government.  i would also mention that a large portion of the US population descends from those same germans that begat the nazis.  of course you've been trained by years of schooling to be blind to this duplicity.. you seem to think americans are a "race of their own", just like the japanese think.  well welcome to the real world buddy.
<BR>

<BR>
you wonder why america has trouble "making friends".  well its because of americans like you, who are the product of a nation culturally set apart from the rest of the world too long, like the little kid at school who spent the first 10 years of his life locked up in a cellar.  you don't understand a world were there are more than just americans, and your effort at understanding is simply that those people just "want to be americans" and since they can't are simply turning "squalid" with envy.  well let me be the first to tell you: fuck you.

I think the person who wrote this is very sad and needs to realise that while sking (spelling!) is he going to wear a shirt saying "I Love Adolf" or "I respect and believe in what Switzerland did with the Gold"?  I think not.
<BR>
What he would be doing is (A) supporting his own Country's airlines, (B) helping other countries thive by spending your money there.
<BR>

<BR>
You said about your country "America has inflicted on many different races throughout the years"  then, it pussels me why you want to live in your Country if it did so much wrong? If you won't go to other Countries because of what 1 person has done, why stay in yours?
<BR>

<BR>
I personally think that this site has been created by some deprived man who still lives with his parents in their seller, who has no friends, doesn't work because his mom want to protect him from "Nasty People" and all he does is watch TV and w#nk off while thinking of his Dad!
<BR>

<BR>
This whole site has been created simply to amuse his rather odd sick fantasy that if he publicly disagrees with everybody and upsets a few people, they (like myself) will post in here and as a result he will have made a friend.
<BR>

<BR>
I must admit that I myself have been fooled into posting in here, but what we should all do is leave this poor sad little boy to his dollys and pretend that he isn't here.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and if you are reading this, my email is (vinnie@black-mesa.org) please feel free to email me with any comments, although if you do email me, that does not meen that we are friends! (Sorry to break your bubble) I would simply like to hear your view on what I have said!

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First of all, most of the people of Italy and Germany didn't have control over what their governments did. I don't think there was an initiative on the ballot that read:
<BR>

<BR>
Jews:
<BR>
    a. leave them alone
<BR>
    b. levy heavier taxes on them; they're rich
<BR>
    c. exterminate them.
<BR>

<BR>
Granted, they didn't like them, but they didn't hand-pick the fate of the Jews. But even their dislike was manufactured by someone else.
<BR>

<BR>
The same goes with Italy. I know someone whose grandfather shot off his foot so he wouldn't have to go and fight for that idiot. Is there any argument that these two governments weren't fascists? I don't think we need to whip out Webster's, biatch, to know that people don't have too much of a say in a fascist regime.
<BR>

<BR>
As far as racism being illegal in the good 'ol USA, Mr. Cleaver, it was common practice until about 50 short years ago. Surely there are restaurants that have been around that long. Especially ones in hotels. 
<BR>

<BR>
The point is that places in the South, like Atlanta, are pretty progressive. I don't think you'll find many German or Italian people around now who share the same goals their governments did in the '40s. If you don't want to visit any places/regions that practiced or condoned racism at any time, well, good luck.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, last time I checked, Hitler and the SS were human. Not great humans by any stretch of the imagination. They were sick and disgusting. But none of them were robots. The same can be said of people in the South. Know what that means? Your righteous indignation is...well, you figure it out, since your intellect is superior.

Go back to Kuro5hin with that bag of arse.

Listen, extermination of ten percent of the population is rather hard without the active complicity of a lot of people.  I hope you're not trying to peddle the tired line about how 'the evil Nazis seized Germany out from under the Germans.'  Hitler got an awful lot of votes, and <i>Mein Kampf</i> had been in print for years when that happened.  There were lots of sympathizers in every country, and more who just didn't care.<BR><BR>Italy was pretty decent about its Jews compared to, say, France.  I don't know why you've singled them out except that they were officially part of the Axis.  Italy was probably as much a hindrance as a help to the Nazis.<BR><BR>Back to the point about dislike being 'manufactured.'  Anti-Semitism wasn't a Nazi invention, it was a very popular political stance.  There are interesting reasons for this, historically, but the point is that Hitler came out of an anti-Semitic milieu.  He didn't conjure it into being.  It wasn't even novel.  Very few Germans had any kind of affection for Polish Jews in 1900, to say nothing of 1934.<BR><BR>Of course, black Americans have faced and continue to face nasty discrimination, that turned lethal revoltingly often.  It's now incumbent on you to show how slavery, as evil as it was, is the moral equivalent of the expropriation, dehumanization, and extermination of two-thirds of a nation.  Have you read Hannah Arendt on totalitarianism?  It's a bit more than discrimination.  The Holocaust was categorically different from even other genocides.<BR><BR>Nathan<BR>--<br><b>Li'l Sis:</b> Yo, that's a real grey area.  Even by my lax standards.<BR></FONT></td>

I think the people were influenced more by fear of being killed by Hitler's SS for dissent than 'hatred' for the jews. What could the citizens have done against an army at his will? Whatever the feelings were about Jews before, I don't think anyone had in mind the horrific industrialization of death that was in store for them. Are you too simple to realize that I appreciate the value of life? I don't try to be a moral hero. I just try to do the best that I can with the situations presented to me. I don't think that choosing one tourist destination over another gives me any higher moral ground than the next man, save for atrocities in the current. The author's example was South Africa during Apartheid.
<BR>

<BR>
And don't try to blow little details out of proportion-- I said that 50 years ago discrimination was commonplace. Don't think that I'm naive enough to think that it doesn't happen now. 
<BR>

<BR>
To compare slavery and death is a bit like apples and oranges. Maybe they're a little different, but they're still fruits. Any life is better than none, and I'm sure that's the last thing to go through most people's minds when they die. But slavery is no real life, I don't think you would argue against that.

Oh, so it was an accident was it ? Please. The extermination of that number of people cannot be done by a small group of people. Much like the open source operating system 'Linux' the holocaust was the work of thousands of people co-operating in a very negative way.
<BR><BR>
The German race is very much like the slashdot readership. It is groupthink minded.
If you go to a beach in Europe, you will see that they place their towels on the sunbeds the night before to ensure they have enough 'lebensraum' the next day.<BR><BR>
But the article was about the fact that even today, these countries have not learned their lessons. Naziism is proliferating throughout the EU (forth reich) and I for one will not condone it by visiting the 'pariah nations' mentioned in the article.<BR><BR>

"Not so. They were anti-semitic to begin with and Hitler used that to his advantage." 
<BR>

<BR>
the christians and jews had lived side by side for hundreds of years.  then one day the christians start killing the jews.  do you think that didn't need some form of kick starting?  i say that fear/respect (apparently a very potent combination) for the nazi's was this trigger.  the germans were among the most educated people in the world.  they weren't mindless bigots as you try to portray them.  they were embittered because of a few things they saw as unfair when they looked at their neighbors and this built up to world war 1, which led the way for world war 2.  such a series of events seems possible to imagine in any nationalistic country, not just germany.  how about the communist "witch hunts" in your own "shining pillar of freedom" or whatever your current opinion is.  
<BR>
with the right kind of propaganda, any group of people are capable of the turning a blind eye to monstrosities like those the nazi's commited.  think what would have gone unquestioned immediately after september 11th.  almost anything.  it is 12 years of education to the contrary that will make this hard for most americans to see.
<BR>
"The German race"
<BR>
oh they're a race now are they?  even though they're genetically almost identical to the rest of northern europe and a good chunk of the north american population?  please..
<BR>
as for the sun towel thing, that's true.  however i think part of that is just feeding off each other.  i've seen my parents (brits) conspire to get their towels on even before the idea crosses the germans' minds.  that and just throwing the german towels on the floor or in the pool (wind can do terrible things to an unattended towel..)
<BR>
as for "naziism is proliferating throughout the EU", i think that is certainly an overstatement.  first of all, i think you should brush up on your definition of naziism.  these groups, for the most part, are simply far right.  similar groups exist in the US.  i would also point out that said groups are unlikely to have any political power any time soon.
<BR>

<BR>
i had several relatives that were germans.  i'm not going to pretend they weren't assholes.  but they certainly weren't monsters.  germans have a different view on life from other groups, for sure, but it certainly isn't an "evil" view.  
<BR>
i'm surprised noone's talked about the japanese so far.  now there is a group of very racist people who have never had to face up to the atrocities they persecuted in world war 2.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

More recently however Kurt Waldheim has hit the headlines for his Nazi connections and currently Jorg Haider is singing the praises of Naziism. 
<BR>

<BR>
 Jerks are born everywhere; Hitler just gained power.  I don't feel it is fair to say "Austria is an evil place" simply because he was born there.  Let's look at the general populace: They are very friendly people, moreso than many other countries; even the US.  Same thing goes for Jorg.
<BR>

<BR>
  FYI, the Nazi party is not an evil, hell-bent on dominating the world, party.  They earned a bad name, but it's mainly a workers union.  Of course, we may as well look at the KKK...
<BR>

<BR>
  I wouldn't say the US is a communist country simply because there is a communist party (they hold no power, but they are there!)
<BR>

<BR>
 ) What more can be said of the country that welcomed Hitler with open arms in 1938, managed to avoid the full-scale de-Nazification program which the Allies applied to Germany, and then proceeded to elect Nazis and Fascists as though there were nothing wrong with it. 
<BR>

<BR>
  Yes, Austria is very Nazi-inclined still.  Let me think here... umm... nope, never heard any other Austrian mention it.  Actually, we are a federal republic.
<BR>

<BR>
 ) Germany's name will forever be synonymous with Naziism.
<BR>

<BR>
  For bigots like yourself.  Actually, if you look at Germany now, there are very few who talk about it.  It's like a bad memory.  But keep dwelling on the past.
<BR>

<BR>
  Are all Americans this way?
<BR>

<BR>
 ) The common European currency was Hitler's idea, which is why older Austrians are finding it easy to use. 
<BR>

<BR>
  Hitler's idea was to have ONE STATE.  Also, older Austrians have seen how many different types of currency?  Quite a few.  It's not like the US which has had one currency for over 100 years.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
 ) The rest of your comments- 
<BR>

<BR>
  How about you find one country that does not have a history of: War, human rights problems, etc?
<BR>

<BR>
  "Gasp!  The US has had a history of slavery and child labor!  It must be a terrible place!  I can not go there!"
<BR>

<BR>
  Did you forget that people change?  Well, some.  Let's not forget the people from South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana.
<BR>

<BR>
 ) I think you will agree I cannot go here and keep a clear conscience.
<BR>

<BR>
  You can't.  Your mind works in weird ways that I won't attempt to understand.  Rest assured that I won't miss not having you here.  Stay away from Austria.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You condemn Europe and the European currency because the Nazis wanted to unify Europe and its monetary system?? The nazis also skied. Do you suppose that makes skiing a racist sport? The Hitler supported environmentalism and animal rights. Therefore those are nazi values? Germany, had many top rocket scientists in the WW2 era, so rocket science must be nazi science. Space science must also be nazi science since it depends on rockets. Vegetarianism must be a form of naziism too...
<BR>

<BR>
Get off it. Go to Europe and ski. Racism and genocide are extremely evil, and should be condemned. The world would be a better place if people concentrated on correcting specific evils, rather than condemning generalized associations of ideas. "Europe" is not evil. Le Pen is. Go there and support the minorities and the liberal thinkers.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You can actually travel without overtly supporting the regimes that control them.  By definition, the ruling class of every country is to some degree unethical, and by standing on soil, you can't help but support some corrupt regime.  But the overwhelming majority of people are good, and you shouldn't limit your options because a few fucked up people build borders around their "flocks".
<BR>

<BR>
With this in mind, use the following guidelines for travel:
<BR>

<BR>
* Travel cheap.  It doesn't really cost a lot to move around in countries, especially those with opressive regimes.  Otherwise, the people wouldn't be able to move themselves.  Ok, so you may have to ride a bus with chickens, but this is part of the fun.
<BR>

<BR>
* Patronize the people.  In other words, eat the food of the people, take the transportation of the people, etc.  Don't eat at McDonald's or Le Shiek's Harem Buffet, and ride personal jets across the country.  You will then avoid supporting the regime.  You're there to get a flavor of the country instead of being shielded from it, aren't you?
<BR>

<BR>
* Respect the customs of the people.  Without stepping over your own morals, follow the customs of a people as much as possible.
<BR>

<BR>
* Treat people the same as you treat your friends back in your home country.  You can find a connection with even the most diverse cultures out there.  Not following this guideline creates the "stupid american tourist" stereotype.
<BR>

<BR>
The point of these guidlines is to be conscious, and travel with as little impact on the place of travel as possible.  These are good guidelines for day to day life as well.

"Dmg" and his cronies, should take note that it's in these nasty, naughty, bad, sickening and intolerant fascist nations that they are allowed to get away with their diatribe. I wouldn't fancy your chances in Saudi for example.

Wake up and smell the coffee. Realise what a lucky son of a bitch you are for having the comfort of knowing when your next meal is going to be. Nobody that matters gives two hoots about your phoney radicalism.

I really think this world hates you. I don't think there is any country in the world that can claim the moral high ground; I therefore suggest you leave at once to somewhere more hospitable.

I won't go into that.  but it seems to me that if you are so worried about spending your money somewhere that has a history of bad political events (ie:naziism) then that pretty much eliminates the option of spending money at all.  I'm pretty sure that if you looked into the history of any nation you would find something you could find questionable (yes that includes the usa).  so then you have the option of not spending any money, or getting over your strange mental complex and going to switzerland for a vacation.  besides,  they aren't a nazi country by any means.  it seems to me that if you bye a ticket to switzerland and go to a ski resort you aren't supporting any racist group, you are supporting a ski resort.  it seems a little imature and deffinitly ignortant to think that the ski resort doesn't deserve your business because of something someone unrelated to the ski resort did a long time ago.  actually,  it seems very stupid.
