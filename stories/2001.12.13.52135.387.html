Well, all I'm saying is that when Ian Hislop took over editing <a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk/">Private Eye</a> from Richard Ingrams, he made an important editorial change. Richard liked to publish juicy articles because they <i>seemed</i> true. In the cold light of day, these articles were libellous canards, and the Eye's legal defense fund took a pounding as irate media personalities successfully sued the Eye time and time again.

As for your hate of God -- don't play games with yourself. If your original post isn't a classic example of denial, then I don't know what is.

Here's a hit: if you don't belive in something, you normally don't go around trying to prove your non-belief to total strangers. Imagine a person that professes to not believe in Santa Clause. Further, imagine that the person has an annoying habit of aggressively explaining his non-belief to complete strangers, jumping at any chance he gets to so. Yet further, imagine that this person becomes violently agitated and defensive whenever he recieves any sort of rebuttal, no matter how mild. Does that sound strange and perhaps abnormal to you? I suggest you consult your neighborhood mirror.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">There is not simply one god in which theists can believe.  There are millions of people all over the world believing in what they think is the only true god or gods.  I suggest that you do some homework on the nature of global religion and the various belief systems developed throughout human history.  Unfortunately, as you have demonstrated, most people tend to ignore or outright admonish those who have beliefs different from them--everyone claiming that their god or gods are the only <i>proper</i> ones.  This causes much conflict--long, bloody wars, territorial disputes, and the like.  Which is ironic, since most religions teach that life is precious... yet more lives have been taken in the name of religion than should be necessary.  If god did exist, which, of course, is not true, then it would be a shame to worship such a deity that would allow others to murder and maim in "his" (or "her" or "their") name.


<BR><BR>I don't "know that there is a god".  I know that there <i>isn't</i> a god.  My knowledge is based on the fact that the existence of a god or gods cannot be proven.  You cannot prove that god exists.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, there is no such thing.

<BR><BR>Again, I do not hate any god because I know that a god or gods do not exist.  One cannot hate something that doesn't exist.  I find it interesting that you seem to be fixated on whether or not I hate something that I don't believe exists.

<BR><BR>I also find it interesting that you keep claiming I am in "denial" and that I "really believe there is a god", or that I am attempting to prove my non-belief.  There is nothing to prove--my non-belief stands on its own.  You seem to be the one in denial and having difficulty coping with the fact that someone can have utter disbelief in god, gods, heaven, hell, the devil,  the bible, etc.  Perhaps you should see someone about that.

<BR><BR>Imagine someone who attempts to prove the existence of santa claus at every given opportunity.  Imagine that this person visits others who have stated that they do not believe in santa claus, and regardless of the reasons given for their disbelief, said person attempts to convince the others that, even though they have repeatedly stated their disbelief, they really do believe.  Imagine that this person, upon discovering that simple argument is not an option, resorts to fallacious debating techniques and attacks, despite the obvious flaws in said persons logic.  Imagine that, despite all of the obvious proof of the non-existence of santa claus, said person continues to believe and attempt to argue his existence with others--regardless of the fact that there is little interest in said person's opinions-- yet this person becomes so agitated at the thought of santa's non-existence that said person continues to debate this topic with anyone who looks even slightly interested...

<BR><BR>
This is a clever tactic the devil uses to trivialise the matter, to joke about it and lead people to believe that God (and hell) don't really exist. You don't <i>really</i> die right? You just come back as some re-incarnated lifeform according to how "good" you have been ... and what type of God would make people burn in eternity in a lake of fire after all? 
<BR><BR>
As with most of the devil's lies, this couldn't be farther from the truth. God is fair, just and loving. As tkatchev has pointed out, when you study the Bible taking this into account, it is clear that hell is not a physical place at all. 
<BR><BR>
Hell is the realisation that you have eternal separation from God and His love -- Hell is the point where you have "run out of chances". Hell results in an eternal, physically painless death. It is not some place you rot and burn.
<BR><BR>
"This fallen world is the battlefield for the greatest conflict the heavenly universe and earthly powers have ever witnessed. It was appointed as the theater on which would be fought out the grand struggle between good and evil, between heaven and hell. Every human being acts as a part in this conflict. No one can stand on neutral ground. Men must either accept or reject the world's Redeemer. All are witnesses either for or against Christ. Christ calls upon those who stand under his banner to engage in the conflict with Him as faithful soldiers, that they may inherit the crown of life...The Lord Jesus Christ has summoned the world to hear.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">hauntedattics-- I don't see how saying "to people who think that their own god or religion couldn't support something like this" is lumping all religious people together.  Had that person said, "All people who believe in a god or gods cannot stand having their religion criticized"--<i>that</i> would have been generalizing.  I took it as more of a heads-up to anyone who took the article as a general affront to their religious beliefs or their god or whatever, because, as we've seen several times and in various circumstances, there <i>do</i> exist certain religious individuals out there who cannot take even the lightest ribbing of their beliefs without going on a crusade.  

<BR><BR>Example-- when my mother visited last week, I showed her what I consider to be a hilarious Rowan Atkinson stand-up tape.  When it got to the part where he's reading from the bible about jesus performing miracles while the people working in the kitchen are shouting "Go on, give us another one" and "Do you do children's parties?" (unto which the lord replied, "no"), my mom immediately denounced the whole thing as "blasphemous".  Shows you what I know.

<BR><BR>One of my great spiritual heroes, although I didn't follow his belief in theism, made a great quote before he passed away recently: "Any religion that can't tolerate questioning deserves to fade."   You know, which is as true for religion  as it is for any other belief.  Perhaps that's why most religious texts warn so vehemently against questioning whether or not that particular belief system is valid... just in case its followers might find out the truth.

<BR><BR>Anyway... the Onion, yes.  That's also what I thought when I first read this article--very much the same style, so you can see where they nipped it from.  Oniony goodness will always prevail, though I think they've gone a little soft lately.  I can't see them putting something as hit-home as the "fanatics" bit up-- but <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3745/all_seven_deadly_sins.html">this</a> was funny. ;)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I think evidence has a great deal to do with determining whether or not one is theist or atheist, as our Anonymous Reader friend was explaining.  

<BR><BR>The reason why I say this is because you, as a theist, believe that the burden of proof for the existence of a god or gods lies with what you know to be true about his existence, as is the case for many theists.  Many believe that tangible "proof" of the existence of a god or gods is unnecessary and goes against the very grain of what it means to be a "believer" (i.e. A "believer" does not need "proof" in order to believe).  That is why it is called "faith", as in "Having faith in god".  And that is one reason why many people, such as myself, do not believe in a god or gods-- because relying on faith alone in determining ones spiritual path does not seem reasonable nor logical.

<BR><BR>However, and I say this with total honesty, I have great respect for those who choose to believe or not to believe in any manner that they choose.  It would be hypocritical for me not to--as an atheist I struggle daily in this not-so-church-and-state-separated society, and I would one day like to be able to freely express <i>my</i> choice to not believe without people looking at me as if I had suddenly grown a second head.  Not that they don't have that right, of course, but it is awkward and tiring.

<BR><BR>So I will respect your opinion that I am falling from or have already fallen from "god's grace" (although you haven't specified <i>which</i> god), as I hope you would accept my opinion that all theists (mono-, multi- and so on) are living in a fantasy world--relying on the words of several thousand year old fairy tales to lead them down a moral path in order to spend eternity in heaven, brahman, valhalla, nirvana, Shinto kami, asphodel and elysium... all paradisial alternatives to simply dying, which is one of humankind's greatest fears (death without eternal life or rebirth), and is one of the major reasons behind humankind's creation of religion (along with explaining the unexplainable).

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I can see where you're going with this.  But isn't it easier to say that one is "generalizing" than it is to actually try and understand the point one was trying to make originally?  This place seems to be overwhelmed with generalization-mongers, no offence.  Had I actually said, "all Christians have it easy, and all atheists are made to feel as if cursed with a superfluity of heads?" I would agree with you-- but this is not the case.

<BR><BR>I can understand the feelings you've had where presenting your personal beliefs in society is concerned.  I can sympathize with that, having been in more than a few uncomfortable religious-oriented situations myself (and college life was the least of them).  I <i>would</i> say that most of the negative attention anyone receives due to their beliefs, lifestyles, etc. (ranging anywhere from religious preferences to sexual orientation) stem from the stereotypes and generalizations of others.  For instance, some people, upon learning that someone in their presence is xian, might immediately think "uptight", "prudish", "lame", etc. merely <i>based</i> on the person's beliefs without knowing that individual personally.  Others, upon learning that another individual is atheist, might immediately think "satanist", "pagan", "anarchist", etc. simply because some people cannot wrap their minds around the thought of not believing in <i>anything</i> involving a supreme creator-being of any form.  But such is society at large-- a collection of us all thinking we know what's good for the general populous without taking the time to truly appreciate the beauty found in diversity.  And, unfortunately, this is also a society bound in all forms of discrimination.  Maybe, someday, believers and non can learn to appreciate the rights of the other to practice their spirituality (or not) in any way that does not threaten the values or beliefs of either side. 

<BR><BR>However, in my society at least (that of the United States), xianity <i>is</i> prevalent in all facets of day to day life.  This is due in part to this country's history, which has sort of percolated throughout the years.  It is the one belief system that is accepted without a blink or question as to its "place" in our society.  And now, as we've recently seen in our current xian fundie-oriented federal administration, many separation of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/08/08/bush.habitat/index.html">church</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/LAW/12/10/scotus.schoolprayer.ap/index.html">state</a> decisions have already been challenged.

<BR><BR>Simply put-- personal decisions where religion is concerned may range from the devout to the fanatic to the non-involved and anywhere in between.  But this has less to do with "what one believes" than it does with "<i>how</i> one believes".  It is more accepted in this society to believe in some form of spiritual deity, or deities, than it is to have absence of belief .  That has nothing to do with generalizing or stereotyping against other belief systems-- it is a fact.  

<BR><BR>I have no problem with one's personal religious or absence of religious preferences.  I do have a problem, however, when another person's beliefs are forced upon or take preference over my own, as I'm sure you would agree. I can imagine how most white, Anglo-Saxon, protestant Americans would feel if someone suddenly started threatening their beliefs, lifestyles or religious choices... by putting myself in the shoes of everyone else.  Does it matter to me what others think of my own personal choices where my life is concerned?  Not one whit.  But I would like to live and raise children in a society where my opinions and choices aren't pushed aside or threatened by the personal views and morals of others, but instead are accepted as a valuable contribution to the diversity of our culture and to individual freedoms as a whole ... but that's just a dream, of course. ;)<BR><BR><BR>Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you.  <i>Bill Hicks</i><BR></FONT></td>

Look, any sensible athiest has plenty of respect for the sensible christian.  The sensible athiest realizes that he or she can not escape fundamental philosophical or moral questions by merely abandoning God.  
<BR><BR>
The sensible athiest realizes that he or she can't even escape Faith-- any athiest willing to engage in meaningful discussion will admit to blind faith in something, be it the fundmental nature of humanity (be it Good, or Selfish, or what have you), or in the Scientific Method (which ultimately requires blind adherence to one ethereal tenet or another), or whatever else they might have in their pockets.

If you run up against anyone preaching any sort of atheist extremism, then you are quite likely facing a trollop, and it is best not to feed such creatures.  They live for attention, you know.

<BR><BR>And I don't believe I ever stated that atheists "have a monopoly on feeling marginalized and shut up".  If you don't mind, could you  explain why you felt that was my message? You seem to be rather fixated with the subject of xian persecution vs. that of atheists, so...

<BR><BR>Do you mind giving me some examples of where and why a xian would be found less socially acceptable than an atheist?  Does there exist any job that a xian would not be qualified to hold based on his or her religious preference, or one in which being a xian might be used as a means of deciding employment incompatibility?  Would being xian figure into an individual's chances of adopting a child?  Finding a mate or being in a relationship?  Having a wedding or funeral service to personal specifications?  How about celebrating the holidays?  Or running for public office?  Raising children?

<BR><BR>Explaining your ethics, morality and personal views to those who are aware of your religious decision, without prejudice, pity, attempts at conversion, or threats of violence?

<BR><BR>I don't know if a few hypotheticals will take the place of anecdotal evidence, but it'll have to do. Every one of those situations, and many more I'm sure, are issues that atheists face dealing with on a daily basis.  Does that mean others don't struggle with finding acceptance in today's society, and that atheists are the only ones facing hardship where societal acceptance is concerned? Absolutely not.

<BR><BR>Again, this isn't a contest to see who is the "most persecuted" (if it were that, it would be a hands-down tie between the Jews, Native Americans and African slaves ;) ).  I will state once again that I sympathize with your difficulties in expressing your religious orientation and the problems it has caused with you socially. However, and speaking as someone who was raised baptist (my father is a baptist minister) and who accepted atheism in her early 20s, I'd love to have the kind of acceptance xians have compared to what we atheists deal with daily.  I'm honestly jealous of it.  Don't believe me?  Spend a day as an atheist and see for yourself. ;)

<BR><BR>The only thing I don't like about xianity?  The way that some of them try to convert everyone around them, or the way some of them act like anyone who isn't xian has the plague.  Does that mean all xians are bad people?  Nope, and I'm not one to let a few bad apples spoil the whole bunch--although, honestly, that's probably the number one reason some xians find difficulty in society: because of the negative, fanatic and self-righteous attitudes of some xian members who give the entire group a bad name (just as the terrorist groups of the Middle East have given islam a bad name to some).  I love studying religions and I try to learn as much from people with differing viewpoints as possible.  Religion and theology are fascinating--but practicing them just isn't for me.  I don't judge people based on their religious preferences--now if only the rest of the world felt the same way.  I let people speak for themselves... I've met religious persons who were the best and atheists who were assholes.  It's the way of the world.   

<BR><BR>Thank you, though, for sharing your opinions with me.  I'm actually not all that jerky or self-righteous in real life either.  I'm not ashamed of being atheist at all--I'm very proud of it, actually, and it was the best realization I've ever had in my life.  The most difficult thing about my decision was explaining it to my religious family, but I'm lucky to be related to such accepting people (mostly, anyway).  Some people have a more <a href=" http://www.atheists.org/comingout/othercloset.html">difficult time</a>.  It was difficult talking about atheism at first, due to the negative attitudes that you get from many people, but now I know that those who really care about me are the only ones who matter.  I hope you find pride in your own beliefs and are never ashamed of who <i>you</i> are. :)

Perhaps that's just me.  But your dumbness is something I know rather little of, personally, so let's not mention it.

<BR><BR>Changing the subject, making unfounded accusations and littering your posts with attempts at personal attack, rather than answering simple questions or holding the semblance of an amicable conversation, despite our personal differences, must be tiring, no?

By making personal attacks and assumptions you have proven that you have difficulty debating effectively.  What is the point of debating a topic with a person who has no interest in hearing the other side, let alone the ability to refrain from ad hominem and emotive attacks?  What, indeed.

I could whip up all kinds of illogical and bottomless <i>conclusions</i>, based only on this half-witted discussion, on your character.  I could <b>assume</b>.  But that would be wrong and fallacious.  I have not once <i>assumed</i> about your character or your personal beliefs or opinions, because I do not know you <i>personally</i>--I only know of you what you have shown here, and that is not enough to make a <i>conclusion</i> of your character.

<BR><BR>Why, then, do you <i>assume</i> my character?  I sincerely apologize if I ever gave you the impression that I feel "that religious people, once enlightened, will become atheists, because it is more sensible".  "Sensible" is subjective, as can be deduced from reading this long and tiresome thread of posts.  Yet, again, when you assume about my character it only shows me that you are unable to discuss this matter maturely, which is a waste of time.

<BR><BR>I will also apologize if I gave you the impression that I felt you were unintelligent in regard to the information I provided on atheism.  As you appeared to want to continue this discussion while making uninformed comments, I felt that it was only proper to point out to you that, if you want to continue this subject, would you please take a moment to speak as if you have acquainted yourself with the topic.  Yet, as you continued to feel that discussing my character was more important than the topic, I continued to take that opportunity.  If you disagreed with the material, why, then, didn't you feel that your opinions on the matter would have been useful to the conversation <i>rather</i> than leaving me to hang while you continued making defamatory statements?  Just curious.

<BR><BR>tkatchev also assumes the character of others before respecting the opinions of others as being different (i.e. "As for your hate of God...", after I explained several times that I have no hate for any gods, as I have no belief in any gods, which would then make it impossible for me to hate any gods, etc.), so would then not be the best source to use when backing up your statements.

<BR><BR>Your use of the term "parochialism" is interesting, by the way.

<BR><BR>"Some guy's" definitions of strong and weak atheism <i>are</i> the definitions for strong and weak atheism.  There is no such thing as "positivistic" and "normative" atheism, although I'm sure that you could individually reason in that manner.  That statement was, in my opinion, quite dismissive and I'm curious as to why you would display such a "who cares" attitude about something you've put so much energy into debating against?  Once again, just curious.

<BR><BR>Discussion and debate can accomplish quite a lot as long as both sides refrain from this sort of quibbling.  However, <i>both</i> sides have to be willing to do their part.  I'm sorry if you felt I was being <a href="./2001.12.13.52135.387.html#12">sarcastic</a> or <a href="./2001.12.13.52135.387.html#19">patronizing</a> in my comments to you, as I was honestly, and respectfully, attempting to discuss this topic with you.  I felt everything was going pretty well until: <a href="./2001.12.13.52135.387.html#17">this</a> (which honestly hurt my feelings, as I thought we were having a nice conversation).

<BR><BR>Anyway, Nathan, you are obviously going to make your opinions of me based on whatever evidence you need, and I'm frankly tired of trying to defend my character, so there you are.  You win.  I'm too old for this, or whatever.  I'm sure you are probably a very nice person despite my opinions of you after this conversation, so I'll keep the jury out so to speak.

<BR><BR>Just do me--nay, <i>yourself</i> a favor?  Try and keep from getting so <i>defensive</i> about everything.  Dear bob, if I thought that all religious people were dumb, misguided, deluded, unenlightened, ignorant, etc., I would have very few people in which I respected personally.  Religion, as you say, has very little to do with it.  Perhaps your relations at the Women's Centre might be greatly improved if you just let...things...go.

<BR><BR>Just a suggestion... I'm sure you have your own. ;)

<BR><BR>Best,
<BR><BR>Amanda<BR><BR><BR>Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you.  <i>Bill Hicks</i><BR></FONT></td>
