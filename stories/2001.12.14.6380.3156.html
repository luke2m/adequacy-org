What Does God Have To Say?


<p>


I am writing this urgent message because I was once a witch. I lived by the stars as an astrologer and numerologist casting horoscopes and spells. I lived in the mysterious and shadowy realm of the occult. By means of spells and magic, I was able to invoke the powers of the


"controlling unknown" and fly upon the night winds transcending the astral plane.


<p>


Halloween was my favorite time of the year and I was intrigued and absorbed in the realm of Wiccan witchcraft. All of this was happening in the decade of the 1960's when witchcraft was just starting to come out of the broom closet.


<p>


It was during that decade of the 1960's, in the year 1966, that a woman named J.K. Rowling was born. This is the woman who has captivated


the world in the year of 2000 with four books known as the "Harry Potter Series." These books are orientational and instructional manuals of witchcraft woven into the format of entertainment. These four books by J.K. Rowling teach witchcraft! I know this because I was once very much a part of that world.


<p>


Witchcraft was very different in the 1960's. There were a lot fewer witches, and the craft was far more secretive. At the end of that spiritually troubled decade, I was miraculously saved by the power of Jesus Christ and His saving blood. I was also delivered from every evil


spirit that lived in me and was set free. 


<p>


However, as I began to attend fundamental Christian churches, I realized that even there


witchcraft had left its mark. Pagan holidays and sabats were celebrated as "Christian holidays."


<p>


As time went on, I watched the so-called "Christian" churches compromising and unifying. I also watched with amazement as teachings from Eastern religions and "New Age" doctrine began to captivate congregations. It was a satanic set-up, and I saw it coming. Illuministic conspirators were bringing forth a one-world religion with a cleverly concealed element of occultism interwoven in its teachings.


<p>


In order to succeed in bringingwitchcraft to the world and thus complete satanic control, an entire generation would have to be induced and taught to think like witches, talk like witches, dress like witches, and act like witches. The


occult songs of the 1960's launched the Luciferian project of capturing the minds of an entire generation. In the song "Sound Of Silence" by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, we were told of seeds that were left while an entire generation was sleeping, and that the "vision that was planted in my brain still remains." Now it is the year 2001. All of the foundations for occultism and witchcraft are in place. The Illuminists


have to move quickly, because time is running out.


<p>


It was the Communist revolutionary Lenin who said, "Give me one generation of youth, and I will transform the entire world." Now an entire


generation of youth has been given to a woman named J.K. Rowling and her four books on witchcraft, known as the Harry Potter Series. As a


former witch, I can speak with authority when I say that I have examined the works of Rowling and that the Harry Potter books are training


manuals for the occult.


<p>


Untold millions of young people are being taught to think, speak, dress and act like witches by filling their heads with the contents of these books.


<p>


Children are obsessed with the Harry Potter books that they have left television and video games to read these witchcraft manuals. The first book of the series, entitled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," finds the orphan, Harry Potter, embarking into a new realm when he is taken to "Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and


Wizardry." At this occult school, Harry Potter learns how to obtain and use witchcraft equipment. Harry also learns a new vocabulary,


including words such as "Azkaban," "Circe," "Draco," "Erised," "Hermes," and


"Slytherin"; all of which are names of real devils or demons. These are not characters of fiction!


<p>


How serious is this? By reading these materials, many millions of


young people are learning how to work with demon spirits. They are


getting toknow them by name. Vast numbers of children professing to


be Christians are also filling their hearts and minds, while willingly


ignorant parents look the other way.


<p>


The titles of the books should be warning enough to make us realize


how satanic and anti-christ these books are. The afore mentioned title


of the first book, "Harry Potter and th
