<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>This is the latest panacea of our ills is it? Small portable fission reactors? Well, excuse me if I am sceptical.<P>Remember Nuclear power in the 1950's? Remember how it would provide electricity so cheap as to be free? How it would be completely safe? The reality has turned out to be somewhat different, has it not?<P><BR>And now we have another example of technical overconfidence. Fission power may well turn out to be useful in many ways, but it will not be solve the thrird world and california's energy problems. It will also be dangerous. Fission power is what fuels the hydrogen bomb, and we are proposing that we put fission reactors in everyone's home? Well, I fear it could well be dangerous. Sure, we can't think of a way of using this for harm just now, but I think that someone somewhere will manage to get a small scale fission reactor to overload and explode somehow, possibly by doping it with Iron, which can cause nuclear meltdown if done correctly, because Fe- + H -> 1.2 x 10³ joules.<P>Also, there are social implications - unemployment and the death of an industry. Do we really want to cause the death of an industry for the sake of cheap electricity? The millions of people who work in electricity plants, where nuclear reactors are used responsibly by the government, will beg to differ on that one. <P>So, from a social and practical perspective I must be sceptical. We must not embrace new technologies solely because they are new, but rather because they improve our quality of life. I don't think fission reactors fulfil that requirement.<BR><P>KTB:<I>Lover, Poet, Artiste, Aesthete, Programmer.</I> <BR> There is no contradiction.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff><I>Fission power is what fuels the hydrogen bomb</I> <BR> <BR>
Yes, you are technically correct, but H-bombs use the energy from a "dirty" fission reaction to provide enough boost to fuse hydrogen (the "clean" part of the explosion).  That is the only purpose.  It is the only way to get enough power quickly enough (in a self-contained device) to fuse hydrogen.  It's not as if the fact that a fission reaction is used to induce hydrogen fusion makes fission inherently bad.<BR> <BR>
However, I agree with the assertion that fission power <B>is</B> dangerous.  It has been dangerous since its inception and it's doubtful that anything will ever change that.  The byproducts it creates are not a problem if handled properly by a large reactor, but the average citizen should never have to come near nuclear waste. :)<BR></TD></TR>

Err..  How did you work this one out?  It makes no sense at all.<P>

How can any single nuclear reaction (by which I mean just one fission or fusion) _EVER_ release over a _kilojoule_ of energy?  I think you have make a mistake between KeV (kiloelectronvolts) and KJ (kilojoules)...  There's a seriously big difference!

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>yeah, 'dope it with Fe', a energy figure taken from the sky, and 'how about the millions of people working in the power industry'.... Man, WHAT a troll! I'm surprised it went through. Notice the statement about hydrogen bomb - it was perfectly trollish! Some people will invariably try correcting it, saying that hydrogen bombs use fusion, and others will point out that he correctly said fission _powers_ (starts) the fusion. <BR><BR> <BR> <I>-- The cigarette does the smoking, you're just the sucker. </I>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>He shouldn't have to.  Anyone that has ever studied economics knows that, as a general rule, efficiency is the path to wealth.  If we had followed your sentiments for the past 200 years most of us would still be working on farms from sunrise to sunset. [Not to mention unemployment, GDP, public health, and other such issues].  Hell, compare employment figures between countries that try to protect jobs like that and those that don't.  You'll find that countries that protect jobs the most tend to have the highest unemployment and the lower GDP per capita.<BR><BR>Take this example (ignoring the environmental concerns and such).  We reduce our energy costs by 20% using this fission method.  Sure, some workers lose their jobs in the short run, but the job markets are tight and they would be absorbed.  Consumers get cheaper energy, meaning that you have to work less to get the same amount of energy.  Furthermore, industry is then allowed to produce cheaper goods and services because they no longer have to pay for this waste, which transfers back into consumers pockets.  When people have more money to spend on other things, guess what?  They spend more.  Meaning that there is more demand for OTHER goods and services that people would RATHER have.<BR></TD></TR>

That's not universally true. And it could be argued that low job security may translate to better conditions locally, but worse conditions overall. If the neighbour works for less, you may be forced to match his better offer for the employer. Ie. a race to the bottom. Numbers alone tell little.

When you extropolate this pattern of increasing efficiency out across all people, it means that people on the whole can work much much less and recieve far more.  In other words, before the days of tractors, fertilizers, combines, and such, mere existence demanded that the vast majority of society work on a farm.  Now with all these advances in technology, that have necessarily obseleted those previous jobs, people are free to pursue other tasks, knowing that if they work a couple hours a day they will at least have basic sustenance.  Although it may be true that people _raise_ their standards of living, and thus keep on working just as hard (if not harder), this is a matter of personal choice.  Because people are basically rational, we can reasonably assume that they are happier working hard.<BR><BR><BLOCKQUOTE> <I>...

But we are in no danger of that today.  In fact, on the aggregate, the gains in efficiency that we have made in the past decade pale in comparison to others.  What little oil workers there are would be READILY absorbed into today's economy.  The vast majority of the people unemployed in this country (very low percentage by historical standards) today are unemployable and/or simply don't wish to work; it's not the jobs don't exist for the taking.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>"the same explosive fuel that downed the hindenburg"<BR><BR>The Hindenburg was not downed by the Hydrogen. The Hindenburg went down because the the fabric "skin" over the metal frame had been painted with a mixture containing powerdered aluminum. It was the first time a blimp had been painted with the substance, and before that the extreme flammability of the stuff was unknown. When the ship dropped its mooring lines, a sparc from the static it picked up from storm clouds arced somewhere on blimp, and the aluminum in the paint caught fire. It burned at several thousand degrees, and the entire skin of the blimp went with it. The heat collapsed the frame, and blew up the hydrogen tanks inside.<BR><BR>The whole thing was discovered by the Germans soon after the explosion, who covered it up fearing that shifting blame from helium to the aluminum paint would make Nazi scientists look bad. It was later discovered by a NASA hydrogen expert who saw that the giant flames and burning skin were inconsistent with hydrogen explosions. He found remnants of the blimp's skin and tests confirmed his theory.<BR><BR>Just a little eye opener...<BR>Unite!

<P>Not necessarily.  Here in Illinois, ComEd generates 75% of it's power from nuclear fission, without any environmental problems so far.

Industries shouldn't be kept around just because they currently exist. It's inefficient, and a bad way to rationalize any decision.  Cheap electricity would benfit people far more than the temporary inconvenience it would cause people in the power industry, although, as you pointed out, there are serious dangers that come up.  The dangers are reason enough to go against walkman fisson reactors. <BR></TD></TR>

<I> Fission power is what fuels the hydrogen bomb, and we are proposing that we put fission reactors in everyone's home? </I>

Well, except you nobody is talking about fusion.  The hydrogen bomb is fussion based, NOT FISSION.  It combines hydrogen atoms together - it fuses them.  The older atomic bombs America dropped in World War I were fission.
<BR> <BR>
I suppose to be technical there is fission in a hydrogen bomb used to set off the fusion reaction, but it isn't the main source of the explosive power.  That is the fusion.
<BR> <BR>
So the artical is talking about the same reaction used in current power plants, just scaled down.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>And big box stores wiped out mom'n'pop stores, themselves wiped out by internet stores, now, can I interest you in some stock in a nice internet business?<BR> <BR>
Economics becomes paradoxically inefficient as markets mature, because the profit incentive becomes the entire driving force.  So why do anything when you can get pure profit?  <BR> <BR>
My stepdad had a toy and hobby store.  It got wiped out by toys r us.  Now the big box stores and chains are having big time problems - is it playco I just saw having a liquidation sale?  How about etoys.com?  The net result is much fewer <I>hobby</I> shops, with the loss of artisan advice giving.  Remember when you were little and built things?  Now everything is just manufactured and toys magically appear - even build-it toys are leaving less to the imagination - check out a lego set lately?  So the inefficiency that economics doesn't address is that of good workmanship - there is a strong incentive away from it, in fact.  Of course, in many circumstances, mass production is a good thing - even Ferrari has come into the 20th century for making engine parts.  But there needs to be a balance of craftsmanship, and that is what is lost.  In /. terms, it means that MS software is much better than anything else.  Flamebait?  No.  For the general office worker, it may be a good thing for MS to take over everything.  But we can think of many situations where the loss of software craftsmanship is a bad, bad thing.<BR> <BR>
And the other thing placing too much faith in market economics is, you wind up with a bifurcated economy - the rich get richer, the poor have children.  Most of us /.ers are squeezed middle income, rich as long as we have our high-paid software jobs, just a few paychecks out of living out of individual transportation modules.<BR><BR>Oracle and unix guy.</TD></TR>

Also, there are social implications - unemployment and the death of an industry. Do we really want to cause the death of an industry for the sake of cheap electricity? The millions of people who work in electricity plants, where nuclear reactors are used responsibly by the government, will beg to differ on that one. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a horrendous concept, holding back innovation because of the workers. Times change, jobs become obsolete, deal with it. This wouldn't be the first example of a new technology stomping out an occupation.
<P>
The automobile was invented, marketed and became pervasive. This had a huge negative impact on passenger trains. This in turn all but destroyed an occupation: porters.
<P>
Prior to municipal waste plants people relied on outhouses for their facilities. This technology killed a couple of occupations as well. First, there was the person who's task in life was emptying out the holding trays of the outhouses. Second was the person who would take this effluent and produce pottasium nitrate from it.
<P>
Skeptisism is a good thing, but being a luddite isn't. There are a huge number of reasons to worry about nuclear power as well as a huge number of reasons on why its actually cleaner and safer than traditional coal fired plants. I'm not sure where my personal stance is at this point, though I have worked in a nuclear reactor (a CANDU reactor at Pickering Ontario) and probably am familiar with more of both sides of the equation than most people.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>I'm not an expert, I'm an electrical engineer, not nuclear. Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that I was an expert, just that I've heard a lot of the arguments pro and con nuclear and have tried to understand and categorize them. I wouldn't take a job that would put me at undo risk, so I needed to do my own homework to determine the risk.
<P>
Anyway, I've done a bit of reading on this as well and experiments with this have been done, albeit I think pumping in radioactive liquid waste. This had the unfortunate side effect of lubricating the plates and causing slip. Plate slip is an earthquake.
<P>
My understanding is that containment isn't completely impossible and that present containment vessels are insanely overengineered. (Which is good, I'm all for overengineering and think its a bit of a misnomer if the risks are high enough).
<P>
There are a few difficulties though, one is that not all the radiation is contained, particles escape and if they're deadly enough (think plutonium) cancer is going to happen. This is true for coal fired plants as well though, and cancer incidence around a coal fired plant is higher than around a nuclear plant. Another is public involvement. It's sort of like prisons, lots of people think that the war on drugs is a good thing even if it means a few more prisons. Nobody wants the new prison in their neighbourhood though. The same goes for actually transporting the waste through neighbourhoods. <BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>You are confusing fission with fusion. <BR>So some general remarks are in order:<BR><BR>Fission is the reaction which powers nuclear bombs and power plants. The energy comes from spliting of Plutonium or Uranium nuclei into lighter nuclei. Fission can work in a chain reaction because usually spliting of heavy nucleous produces neutrons which in turn can split other nuclei.<BR><BR>On the other hand fusion is the reaction which powers H bombs and stars. In fusion 2 lighter nuclei combine to form a havier nucleous. Unlike fission, there is no fusion chain reaction (more or less). Further, using current technology, fusion is to be produced in tokamak, which is a self stabilizing system! In the sense that reaction will never run away. Tokamaks work by confining high temperature plasma with magnetic field. The nuclei in plasma fuse because of collisions due to high temperature in the said plasma. If reaction is going too well, the plasma temperature gets too high, and magnetic field becomes too weak to confine the plasma, causing the plasma to leak out and reaction to stop.<BR><BR>Unfortunatly fusion has major drawback: there are no working reactors! <BR><BR>Also fusion is not as clean as claimed, and you are right to be worried. The easiest way to fusion is the Deuterium-Tritium reaction, unfortunatly it produces a large number of neutrons. The neutrons are ofcause the major problem with all nuclear power and are very harmfull to humans. The neutrons cause formation of unstable isotopes in everything surrounding the reactor making it neccessary to dispose of core and shielding not just the spent fuel.<BR><BR>So fusion will not solve any problems here on Earth. Hopefully, controlled fusion will be allowed into space since the reactor and fuel are "clean" until turned on, where it will be a very useful power source. The only thing better would be antimatter, but that is even harder to get to work.<BR><BR>David<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Tokamak reactors don't produce as many free neutrons as one might suspect.  In every design I've seen, the fusion chamber is surrounded by a thick jacket of liquid lithium.  When a neutron hits Li-6, it produces one tritium atom and one helium atom.  The tritium is sent into the reactor as fuel, and the helium is disposed of.  Li-7 is much more common than Li-6, but neutron capture by Li-7 just leads to 2 helium nuclei by an intermediate beta decay.  Both isotopes have pretty big neutron capture cross-sections, so a thick enough jacket will absorb quite a lot of neutrons.<P>
The lithium also serves as the coolant, similar to the water in a typical fission reactor.  So the only thing that is subject to high levels of neutron activation is the innermost wall of the coolant system.  You wouldn't want to spend much time near one, but I don't think it would produce any more free neutrons per kWh than a fission plant does (with equivalent shielding).<BR><BR>81 206 197 224 0</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>main problem with tokamak reactors is that lithium aint cheap -- its as expensive as hell if large quantities are required and a fairly rare element. eve if someone managed to mass produce working reactors (which they havent been able to get working properly in a lab yet) they wouldnt be cheap enough for mass consumption (cant have one in your basement or car for example). <BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff><I>Fission power is what fuels the hydrogen bomb, </I> <P>
This is for all the folks who told you fusion powers the hydrogen bomb:<P>
The H-bomb uses a fission trigger which supplies about 10% of its energy output.  The prompt gamma rays from this blast are used to compress and trigger the secondary stage; this must occur before the mechanical blast rips the secondary apart.<P>
The secondary contains a stick of fission fuel surrounded by fusion fuel surrounded by a thick, depleted Uranium tamper.  When the assembly is compressed the stick of fission fuel fissions, providing neutrons which...<P>
...split the lithium-6 in the fusion fuel into tritium, which fuses with the deuterium in a fusion reaction which yields about 10% of the bomb's output.  We are now up to 20% output.<P>
Finally, the incredibly huge mass of neutrons generated by the fusion reaction induce fission in the depleted Uranium tamper, yielding about 80% of the bomb's energy.  Now we have an explosion.  And 90% of the energy comes from fission, not fusion.<P>
The mantra about H-bombs being "clean" is just one of the many lies told by the nuclear industry to make itself look more useful than it really is.  Richard Rhodes' books <I>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</I> and Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb have many more details about how the current situation came about.<BR><BR>Brackets contain world's first nanosig, highly magnified:[.]</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>I'm sorry, but you are wrong. More than 90% of the energy released in a hydrogen bomb is due to fusion. The fusion reaction itself is initiated by an A-bomb, much in the same way that conventional explosives trigger A-bombs. H-bombs are much more destructive due to the temperatures produced by fusion. Fission bombs are limited because the fission core reaches a size where it is no longer possible to get to completely react before being blown apart. No, H-bombs are not clean; however, when comparing the fallout levels of a large A-bomb to those of a very small H-bomb, the H-bomb produces magnitudes less fallout.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff><I>More than 90% of the energy released in a hydrogen bomb is due to fusion.</I> <P>
No it isn't.  It's approximately 10% fission trigger, 10% fusion reaction, 80% induced fission in otherwise unfissionable depleted uranium thanks to the neutrons from the fusion.  This is one of the most important lies that was exposed by Howard Morland when he exposed the "secret" of the H-bomb in <I>The Progressive</I>.<P>
In fact, because of the way its major fission reaction is triggered the H-bomb is <I>dirtier</I> than an "equivalent" mass of A-bombs.  The fallout is more complex, the isotopes are more exotic, and it is just plain something you don't want to be around when it goes off.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Ohhhh.... I didn't realize you had such a reliable source. The arrangement you describe would be IMPOSSIBLE to detonate. There have only been a couple uranium bombs ever produced, and they were nearly 100% enriched U-235. YOU CANNOT MAKE A BOMB WITH U-238 IN ANY WAY!!! It wouldn't detonate. The "depleated" uranium would only absorb a few neutrons and increase the fallout. It would TAKE AWAY from the yield.
Yes, flame.

BEFORE USE:<BR>
1. Remove cranium from anal cavity<BR>
2. Take a physics course or two<BR>
...</TT> <P>
U-238 <I>is</I> fissionable.  It is not fissile, so it is not used for fuel in reactors, except to be bred into Pu-239.  Neutrons at the energies produced by fission reactions cannot induce fission in U-238.  At that energy, neutrons either don't interact at all, or are captured, leading to beta decay. Neutrons from fusion do have enough energy to induce fission, though.  When you look at the reactions, you see that a few grams of deuterium-tritium mixture can produce enough high-energy neutrons to induce fission in several hundred grams of U-238.  I can't comment on the exact numbers (not a nuclear engineer), but the given figures definitely fit in order-of-magnitude estimates.<P>
This is why H-bomb schematics always show a cylinder of U-238, with a rod of U-238 down the middle, and the intervening space full of deuterium and tritium, with a complete fission bomb at one end.  I think there's usually a beryllium casing outside the uranium cylinder, but I'm not positive.<P>
It is possible to create a bomb which derives almost all its energy from fusion, but such weapons are heavy and large for their yield.  They have almost the same design as described above, but the U-238 jacket is replaced with tungsten or lead.  One mostly-fusion device, the Tsar Bomba, derived 97% of its yield from fusion.  It was intended, however, to have a U-238 jacket, to produce an even higher yield.<P>
Most of this info was taken from the Nuclear Weapons FAQ, section 1.5.  Here's one <A HREF="http://search.cetin.net.cn/internet/DSTI/FAS/nuke/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html#nfaq1.5">link</A>, I'm sure Google can find more if you want.<BR><BR>81 206 197 224 0</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Yes. H-bombs include more uranium to increase their yield, but it doesn't increase it much. <BR> <BR>Most of the power in an H-bomb IS due to fusion. There are many things, all of which pretty much unkown to civilians, done to increase the yield while decreasing the package size. One must remember that there are just a handfull of nations that posses H-bomb (or A-bomb) technology, and the instructions and schematics available in print or on the internet are NOT valid, nor do they come from actual weapons designers. Most of these "designs" are purely speculation of what a bomb may look like from the minds of physicists. You can rest assured that the governments of the world would NOT allow real plans or schematics to become public knowledge. Remember that even China has trouble getting plans from the US's weapons labs (maybe not THAT much trouble, but they at least know where to look for valid designs.)<BR> <BR>Furthermore, a deuterium-tritium reaction only produces ONE neutron per interaction. You MUST have more than one neutron per interaction to sustain a chain reaction. This is as true in weapons as it is in nuclear reactors. Most of the neutrons produced in an explosion will escape the weapon and not be absorbed or result in further fissioning, especially if the U-238 casing is beyond the neutron source. Although U-238 is fissionable, it has an extremely low cross-section for fission. Its cross-section for neutron absorption is much higher. The most likely reaction is simply neutron absorption, which creates plutonium. Fast breader reactors take advantage of this, and breed plutonium in this way.<BR> <BR>It is naive of anyone to believe that nuclear weapons design is common knowledge, and that the only impediment for weapons manufacturing is materials production and handling. In the Manhattan Project days, it was VERY difficult to obtain large amount (mere pounds) of weapons grade U-235 and plutonium. Gasseous effusion is probably the WORST and most innefficient way to separate uranium, but it was the only possible way at the time. Now, ionizing laser techniques are thousands of times more efficient and less expensive. The main reason most nations cannot produce nuclear weapons (specifically hydrogen-based nuclear weapons) is because they don't know how to arrange the materials, and they do not have the resources necessary to research them. There is a reason that many of the planet's most powerful computers are used in weapons design. <BR> <BR>I am constantly annoyed by the number of "experts" in nuclear technology that exist. Many of these people are convinced that all things nuclear are shrouded in secrecy and lies. Yes, when it comes to weapons design, there are MANY secrets and quite a few lies, and I AM GLAD that there are secrets and lies. Possessing nuclear weapons and the technology necessary to produce them requires a maturity that most countries in the world do not posses. It scares me to see places like India and Pakistan threatening to destroy each other with nuclear weapons, knowing that they actually may do it. The US and Russia almost started a few wars, but each side was responsible, even with high tensions in the war room. (Fidel Castro urged Russia to attack, and US generals urged the US to attack during the Cuban missile crisis)<BR> <BR>When it comes to commercial nuclear power, there are no secrets in the reactor or other systems, no super-secret scandals to make the public "think" that it is safer than it "really" is. I am amazed at the number of people that believe that any nuclear power plant can produce a mushroom cloud or even explode like Chernobyl. Yes, there were MANY mistakes and accidents in the early days when the technologies were being developed, but by the '70s, it was pretty well ironed out. The accident at Three Mile Island DID produce a nuclear meltdown. This type of accident was actually not incorporated into the design bases of the plant. The only reason the accident happened in the first place was because the operators DISABLED all of the automatic safety systems.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff><I>Most of the power in an H-bomb IS due to fusion</I><BR><BR>Wrong.  Check out the Federation of American Scientists, who have a remarkably accurate FAQ on the matter.  Check out <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/nuke/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq1.html">this link</A> for details.<BR><BR>Or, for those who are <A HREF="http://www.disney.com">goatse.cx averse</A>, I'll just reprint a snippet of the FAQ here:  <I>The 5 Mt Redwing Tewa test (20 July 1956 GMT, Bikini Atoll) had a fission fraction of 85%.</I><BR><BR>The next claim of yours--namely, <I>"It is naive of anyone to believe that nuclear weapons design is common knowledge"</I>--is just as absurd.  The principles behind nuclear-weapons design are straightforward and are taught in college classrooms to undergraduates.  In the height of the cold war, nuclear-weapons design was published in the open literature.  One physicist might write a paper detailing the particular physical properties of compounds exposed to extremely high radiation flux and whatnot, comparable to those found in the heart of a star--a perfectly acceptable scientific article, but when you say "heart of a star" I hear "in a nuclear weapon undergoing supercriticality".<BR><BR>The Manhattan Project was chaired by General Leslie Groves of the Army Air Corps/USAF, but all the principals involved were scientists.  Have you ever tried to get a scientist to keep something a secret?  They can't.  They're genetically incapable of secrecy.  It's right there in their DNA sequence, somewhere in that giant double-helix, that says, "if it's cool and it furthers our understanding of the cosmos, I've GOT to tell people about it!"<BR><BR>As far back as the early 1980s, the magazine <I>The Progressive</I> was sued by the United States Government to prevent them from publishing extremely detailed specifications and schematics of nuclear weapons.  The DOE only withdrew the lawsuit after it became clear that to get an injunction against <I>The Progressive,</I> they'd have to declassify even more documents and put even more weapons-design material into the public record.<BR><BR><I>In the Manhattan Project days, it was VERY difficult to obtain large amount (mere pounds) of weapons grade U-235 and plutonium.</I><BR><BR>No it wasn't.  Uranium is a very common element.  You can refine it out of granite, for crying out loud.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Yes. What I was saying is that none of the current operating reactors in the US are graphite moderated. Many of the reactors in the UK are, but they are still fairly safe. Personally, I like the idea of a graphite moderated, high temperature gas-cooled reactor for its secondary side efficiency, plus the secondary is exactly the same as is used in fossil fuel plants. The biggest problem with a graphite moderated reactor is that you periodically must "anneal" the graphite, which -could- result in fires, but with CO2 or He as a coolant, it would not burn readily.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Fast fissile material is not a correct term. U-235 is NOT common. Only a handful of nations have any uranium reserves, and of those reserves, less than 0.1% is U-235. As a matter of fact, there is much more gold in the world than U-235. I would hardly call that "common." <BR> <BR>Furthermore, YOUR arguments hold little merit. By claiming that everyone (whoever that is) hates nukes, you lose this "debate". My argument is simple. There is no conspiracy to make nuclear weapons look better than they actually are. Nuclear weapons are horrifying. They are meant for killing and massive death and destruction, but since one nation has them, at least one other nation must have them. You learned this concept in grade school. <BR> <BR>If you really need so much help finding good references, might I direct you to Oak Ridge National Lab, Sandia, DOE, ... By the way, you won't find any information concerning nuclear weapon design on their pages. I wonder why?<BR> <BR>NORAD is not interested in stopping or continuing the arms race. Their current duties have little to do with nuclear weapons anyway. They are quite busy monitoring all of the other air/space traffic. Actually, the "arms race" doesn't even exist anymore. <BR> <BR>How can you say that Dubya hates the arms race? I would argue that he in fact supports it. If he were against an arms race, why would he be pushing Star Wars II so aggressively? Yeah... He hates it... By the way, about half of congress supports this program as well.<BR> <BR> As for you personally knowing a "senior officer in the USAF", who cares? Just because you claim that he does not like them doesn't mean that EVERYONE hates them too. I know MANY people who worked in nuclear ballistic submarines. Most of them are GLAD we have nuclear weapons. I am glad we have nuclear weapons. It actually brings peace. I DON'T like certain nations having these weapons, but they don't use them because WE have them too. <BR> <BR>As for FAS, there is obvious bias in their FAQ and webpages. They are known for opposing all things nuclear. Their FAQ implies that most hydrogen bombs are laden with extra uranium just for nastiness or a small addition to yield. I can't believe that anyone who can work out a few energy equations and criticality equations can say that a 1 megaton or larger device can be made purely with fission (or 90% fission 10% fusion). True, using a D-T reaction can give an increase in yield, it is not a HUGE increase. It is only a few percent. It is obvious that you are not a nuclear physicist or engineer. Please don't get into a debate unless you personally know something technical about the subject matter. It appears to me that you are just a conspiracy theorist.<BR> <BR>Yes I am flaming.<BR></TD></TR>

Nope, it's the neutrons.  There's a lot of energy output too -- thought not as much as you might think; the fusion reaction is actually a little less energetic than the fission reaction, but it scales in ways the fission reaction can't.  And it makes all those damn neutrons, which aren't really what you want, but send them into a block of U238 and you get a very, very, very large boom for your buck.<BR><BR>Brackets contain world's first nanosig, highly magnified:[.]</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Hmmm ... what you are describing sounds more like a U-bomb than an H-bomb. Doing this from memory:<BR><BR>U-bombs were tested in the late 60s. Basically, the idea was to wrap a H-bomb with uranium. The A-bomb trigger would go off initiating an H-bomb explosion which in turn would induce fission in the outer uranium layer for an increased yield. It was a very messy weapon and didn't have a whole lot of strategic value as such. I think the one test killed a bunch of fisherman in a Japanese boat called the "Lucky Dragon" (I forget the original Japanese name) from fallout who were trolling a bit too close to the test site. However this might be more than a little bit mixed up.<BR><BR>It has been a while since I've thought about the history of above-grounds weapons testing and if you are relying on Slashdot for a nuclear physics education you are just plain silly. As a Ph.D. in plasma physics, it is distressing to see the number of scientific dubious assertions that get moderated up (it is as though science here is decided through committee and not experiment).<BR><BR>In any case, because there are many variants of atomic weapons means I don't have a great deal of faith in the previous poster. Depending on the details of the trigger and fusion fuel you can get all sorts of weapons (optimized for explosive yield, optimized for EMP, optimized for neutron yield, optimized for fallout or lack thereof, ...)<BR><BR>A blanket statement that all fusion bombs are fission powered is a bit misleading.<BR><BR>Furthermore, if I recall correctly nuclear proliferation treaties were entered into which effectively arrested development of U-bomb type weapons. Your level of cynicism will dictate whether that means anything to you.<BR><BR>Kevin<BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Actually the fission-fusion-fission bombs as they are also called do have strategic value. The nuclear weapons FAQ for example, mentions that probably most of the strategic warheads are of this type today. The reason is simply to have the smallest package, the smaller the warhead is the smaller your entire ICBM can be (=cheaper). Since the warhead needs a heat shield for reentry anyway, why not make the shield of a material that can increase the yield? Besides, U238 is abundant and dirt cheap...<BR></TD></TR>

By jacketing the third stage with non-fissionable material, three stage devices can produce high yield clean weapons.
Both Zuni and Tsar Bomba were in fact very clean devices - Zuni [3.5 megaton] was 85% fusion and Tsar Bomba [50+ megaton] was 97% fusion.
Both designs permitted replacing the lead or tungsten third stage jacket with U-238 however. A version of Bassoon
called Bassoon Prime was tested in the dirty Tewa test mentioned above. A dirty device derived from the Bassoon
was weaponized to create the highest yield weapon the U.S. ever fielded, the 25 megaton Mk-41. The Tsar Bomba
design was for a fission-fusion-fission bomb with a staggering yield of at least 100 megatons!

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>You mean they make malt liquor in France?  If "Joe" can't find a job, why is he spending his evenings watching television?  Why is he buying designer jeans instead of clothing that is more suitable for a job interview?  300,000 unemployed software engineers in India is a testament to the effects of 50 years of bureaucracy, border wars, and protectionism in India.

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>Its nice to see that Joe supports ending poverty in third world nations.  Which is a better way to end poverty, giving poor people money or giving poor people jobs?  Even low paying sweatshop labor is better than no job at all.  Eventually the labor pool begins to dry up and wages begin to rise.  This happened in Europe in the 1900's and america in the 20's and 40's.  It just like starting to work only for a whole country.  you start off working at a crappy mcdonalds job and work your way up to the high paying software or engineering job.  You have to start at the bottom to get to the top, unless you were born rich.<P><BR>"you've corrupted the Borg"<P> -Picard to Lore</TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff><I>"The reality has turned out to be somewhat different, has it not?"</I>
<P>
The worst nuclear accident in the US was an almost-meltdown at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, PA, and that was how many decades ago?  Compare that to the various natural gas explosions that occur around the country.  Boiling liquid-vapor explosion, anyone?
<P>
What was the worst accident in France, where they get 80%+ of their electricity from fission?  And they're in the forefront of technology in civillian fission (though they're lagging behind the US in nuclear propulsion, as with the rest of the world).
<P>
Whatever you have to say about the spent uranium from the plants, it is still the most environmentally friendly power generation around.  Not only are there no emissions involved by defintion, but there's also no off-shore drilling, no tanker spills, no strip mining, no pipelines, no explosive railray cars, no high-pressure vessels (aside from the boilers themselves)... hell, even windmills and solar arrays require lots of open land, often at the cost of the native animal and plant life.  
<P>
<I>"but it will not be solve the thrird world and california's energy problems."</I>
<P>
Actually, California's power problems would be solved by re-activating the nuclear plants that California environmental lobbies have shut down.  As the lights flicker and diesel backup generators kick in, there are perfectly good nuclear plants just waiting to be used out there.
<P>
<I>"Fission power is what fuels the hydrogen bomb"</I>
<P>
No.  Fusion is what fuels the hydrogen bomb.  While it is true that, right now, the only known way to get an exothermic fusion reaction is with the heat and energy created by fission, fission is not a requirement for fusion.  Look at the sun.
<P>
<I>"we are proposing that we put fission reactors in everyone's home? "</I>
<P>
Just because you have a little radioacive isotopes in your home doesn't mean that it's the right kind of isotope (or even element) to make a bomb, that there's enough to make a bomb, or that you will be able to use it make the isotopes to make a bomb.
<P>
And consider how many homes in the northeast have 1000's of gallons of heating oil (and the explosive fumes involved) underneath their yards.  
<P>
<I>"possibly by doping it with Iron, which can cause nuclear meltdown if done correctly, because Fe- + H "</I>
<P>
I could be wrong, but you still seem to be confusing fission with fusion.  No hydrogen involved in fission.  At best, you might claim that there's "hydrogen" involved, but that's only because that's what emitted alpha particles are (technically speaking).
<P>
Meltdowns only happen if your core is large enough to get hot enough to melt the fuel (and just about anything else), and your cooling system and your control system fails.  This is generally only applicable to large-scale/naval power plants, because they have (relatively) large amounts of fuel..  If I have a fission reactor in my back yard about the size of my air conditioning unit, I'd have to be pretty damned talented to get it to melt down.
<P>
<I>"Also, there are social implications - unemployment and the death of an industry. Do we really want to cause the death of an industry for the sake of cheap electricity? "</I>
<P>
If the alternative is people freezing in the middle of winter, or dying of heat stroke in the summer because they can't afford their power bills, then HELL YES!
<P>
<I>"where nuclear reactors are used responsibly by the government, will beg to differ on that one. "</I>
<P>
Actually, this would be a boom to the nuclear power industry.  Imagine if nuclear reactors were as numerous as air conditioners.
<P>
As for other power generation, they'll need new jobs.  Just like what happened to the ice deliverymen when the refrigerator was developed.  And all those whalers that lost their jobs when people switched to fossil fuels and electric lights.  If bettering society as a whole means a few people lose their jobs, so be it.  Majority rules.

An isotope can have any number of neutrons and still be considered "helium" as long as it has two and only two protons.

Notice I said "strip mining."  A pound of uranium will last years, while a pound of oil, coal, natural gas, etc. may last you a half-hour, depending on what you do with it.  One or two mines in the entire US would provide all the fuel we'd need.  And they'd be small/slow enough to to be way more environment-friendly than your average coal mine.

<P>
Nah, the big problem are the people (*cough* Californians *cough*) that want NO new power plants, no matter how the electricity is produced.  :)<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD bgcolor=ffffff>"Remember Nuclear power in the 1950's? Remember how it would provide electricity so cheap as to be free? How it would be completely safe? The reality has turned out to be somewhat different, has it not?"<BR><BR>The problem is not with nuclear power - it is with people. Nuclear power is a very useful tool, and it can be used to provide electricity so cheap as to be free. It still can be everything they promised, including safe if we can find a way to make electricity that isn't useful as a weapon. IEC fusion shows some promise in this area.<BR><BR>Remember, fission doesn't kill people, people kill people. :) Sorry, I couldn't resist.<BR><BR>"Also, there are social implications - unemployment and the death of an industry. Do we really want to cause the death of an industry for the sake of cheap electricity?"<BR><BR>Sure we do. Why not. I'd like to see the art, music, and movies industries replaced, as well as big oil, big software, and big medicine. I'd like to see them replaced by something that frees people instead of binding them.<BR><BR>As for unemployment, it is very low in the US right now - so low that industries are having amazing difficulty recruiting and hanging on to employees. A touch of unemployment is healthy for the industries you seem to like so much. There is a balance to be had there. Low unemployment can trigger inflation, due to companies having to give their employees all sorts of incentives and then having to raise prices for the consumer. The employees in high-demand industries will not suffer, but employees in low-demand industries will because cost of living will rise but their paychecks won't. This could artificially widen the income gap between rich and poor.<BR><BR>"The millions of people who work in electricity plants, where nuclear reactors are used responsibly by the government, will beg to differ on that one."<BR><BR>Ummm... used responsibly by the government? There's been lots of nuclear accidents caused by governments besides just the famous ones. There have also been deliberate misuses of nuclear power by governments. Hiroshima and Nagasaki spring to mind. You seem to put undue trust in government.<BR><BR>As for millions of people who work in electricity plants, their skills will be useful elsewhere. Trained engineers can find jobs, if they don't mind a little retraining. Plus, I don't think there's really millions of them.<BR><BR>Any good docter would love to become obsolete. Why should electrical engineers be any different? I have mixed feelings about genetic algorithms and AI eventually replacing me as a programmer, but I'd like to see it happen.<BR><BR>"So, from a social and practical perspective I must be sceptical."<BR><BR>So should we all. However, you seem more cynical than skeptical.<BR><BR>"We must not embrace new technologies solely because they are new, but rather because they improve our quality of life. I don't think fission reactors fulfil that requirement."<BR><BR>I agree with your first sentence, but I think fission reactors could fulfill that requirement. I guess we'll just agree to disagree, then.<BR><BR></TD></TR>
