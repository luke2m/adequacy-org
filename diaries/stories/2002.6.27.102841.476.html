<p>
We've done it.  We've actually taken evolution and killed it dead.  It doesn't matter what side of the evolution/creation argument you were on, the point is now moot.<p>
<p>
In a nutshell Darwin's law can been reduced to 'survival of the fittest'.  There is loads of evidence to support this assertion over geological ages, but we don't need to get into that because it doesn't matter anymore.  Western civilization has determined that humanity at least will not evolve any more if we ever did.<p>
<p>
How, you might ask, could this be true, if we are going to evolve, how can society stop it.  Society as a whole certainly has no major control over the genetic developments that lead to mutations that lead to evolution of a species over huge samplings, etc...<p>
<p>
True, but society does have control over stop signs.  Same thing.<p>
<p>
Think about it for just a minute.<p>
<p>
Your average Joe is driving home from work during rush hour.  Approaching a courtesy corner intersection he elects not to stop and see if anyone is coming, he's probably too busy chatting on his cel phone and fiddling with the radio dial to bother.  Your average Jane is driving home from her work at the same time.  Approaching the same intersection from a non-parallel direction she goes right through, after all, stopping would cause her to smudge her lipstick which she is applying in the rear-view mirror.<p>
<p>
Joe and Jane meet in the middle of the intersection at 50km/h (30m/h), they crash, they die, and they remove themselves from the gene pool.  Darwin has been proven correct, survival of the fittest by removal of the weak.<p>
<p>
Had Joe and Jane had a brain in their heads, and thus been useful members of the gene pool, they would have slowed down and made sure it was safe before entering the intersection.<p>
<p>
Had just Joe, or just Jane had a brain in their head, they would have slowed down, seen the other speeding through and avoided death, thus preserving themselves for the next generation.<p>
<p>
But no, society didn't like that.<p>
<p>
Consider what happens now to our idiot Joe and Jane who approach the same intersection that's been made into a 4 way stop.  Joe comes up, notices the stop sign.  First thought for idiot Joe... screw it, go through.  Second thought... ohhh, can't do that, there could be a cop there with a radar gun and a nasty ticket book, that would suck, my insurance premiums are high enough already.  Idiot Joe stops.  First thought for idiot Jane... I really don't know about this colour lipstick with these shoes, where is .. oh, stop sign, guess I should stop.  Idiot Jane stops.  Idiot Joe looks at idiot Jane and sees a breeding chance, huhhh, female, must mate.  Idiot Jane looks at idiot Joe and who the hell knows what she thinks.  They meet, they fall in love, they reproduce.  Thus killing the concept of survival of the fittest, we've just let the idiots breed more idiots.<p>
<p>
Society has taken away the benefits of being intelligent, it reduces our need to think by doing it for us on so many occasions, most amazingly, basic personal safety through intelligence.  An intelligent person should know not to do stupid things, that's part of the intelligent part I would think.  Unfortunately, society as a whole has determined that it should do the thinking for us.  Where there is no law in place to keep people from doing stupid things, or where there is no expectation of the law being enforced, people who have lost the need to think for themselves do stupid things.<p>
<p>
In the best light, perhaps society is setting us up as a species for the next big wipe out, the cataclysmic weirdness that is going to reduce the idiots in the gene pool and lead to a more evolved 'type' taking over.  If they took away stop signs and traffic lights, drunk driving laws and speed limits tomorrow, the death rates would be cataclysmic... in the short term.  Those stupid enough to celebrate this softening of the law by driving at 150km/h (90m/h) through intersections while swilling Jack Daniel's would die out fairly quickly I would think.  Sure they would take a lot of other folk with them at first, but the really intelligent people would just stay the hell off the roads for a wee while.  <p>
<p>
Before people flame this for being incomplete, I acknowledge this.  Space is a consideration in this forum.  I have many more thoughts on it, who knows, if there is some intelligent conversation following this perhaps I'll get to them.<p>
<p>
For those with me I propose a new slogan;<p>

as for silly argument, well, yeah.  do you think I advocate the wholesale theft of stop signs?  Saddly, this would likely just cause confusion and accidents from people who were too stupid to figure out what to do if they weren't there.  that being one of the main points of the argument.<BR>
<BR>
people have stopped thinking for themselves.  our governments support this position.  a stupid population is more maleable?  I dunno why.<BR>

On a side not, I bought my 10 year old (today is his birthday) some nutty putty (orange silly putty in a cute little peanut thing) last night.  it specifies on the label that the product is not to be used as an earplug.<BR>
<BR>
not only are we not to think for ourselves, but someone somewhere likely sued the company because they shouldn't be expected to be intelligent enough not to figure that out for themselves.  that this advisory now exists is evidence that your average company fears that the government will legally support the average consumers right to be a complete moron and misuse things.<BR>

<BR>
clearly the ability to understand meaning in words isn't part of your editorial skill set.<BR>
<BR>
that's ok though, we can go to your points about evolution.<BR>
<BR>
Darwin (you might have heard of him) in his book (doesn't seem you've read it based on your comments) "On the Origin of the Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life" on more than one occassion likens his 'Natural Selection' as "(t)his preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations".  I'm wondering if you understand what that means or how it refutes your argument.  s'ok if you don't, ask your older sister to explain it to you when she is done watching Buffy.<BR>
<BR>
hmmm, well.<BR>
<BR>
He goes on much past that though, and should you like I'd be happy to write you a quick summary of his work for your perusal.  <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps then you can take your head out of your ass.<BR>
<BR>
Past that though, you kept going, just for fun.  Curiousity here, are you one of those idiots who hopes to race around like a fucking lunitic when you are old enough to have a licenese?  Seriously, are you the type who wouldn't drive responsibly if it wasn't for the laws 'enforcing' basic human intelligence?<BR>
<BR>
I don't fashion myself smarter than the rest of the people, or even you necessarily.  Apart from this load of shit you've posted I've not seen anything else you've done so I can't comment on it.<BR>
<BR>
And well, yeah, I admit to getting a kick out of the Darwin Awards, they're just funny.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Alternatively, even if you could afford such luxuries, you would shun them in order to be "old-fashioned". Manual transmission the gearing equivalant of a hand-crank to start the car. Even Formula 1 racing drivers do not put up with manual transmission - and they are the best drivers there are.

<br><br>
Of course, if you really do need a crossroads, 4-way stops are the worst possible way to go about it. Alternating lights are a good idea, but what you really need is a <b>roundabout</b>, or a <i>rotary</i> as the Yanks call it. There is a constant flow of traffic on the roundabout. Roundabouts are built to give you ample viewing of the oncoming traffic, so you can know if you have to slow down or not. They also don't penalise drivers doing left/right turns.
<br><br>
For super-style, you can upgrade your roundabout with traffic lights and get a gyratory. Not only does it have a groovy name, but it allows better congestion management in the mornings, when some drivers are intimidated by the volume of traffic on the roundabout and don't get on it when they have the chance, thus holding up everyone behind them.<BR><i>adequacy.org -- because it isn't</i><BR></FONT></td>

Finally you summon up some mythical people named Joe and Jane and proceed to write a novel about their driving antics, which as you explain, leads to the demise of the concept of an almost two hundred year theory (like what the fuck?).<BR>

I have the same information in my head has Joe blow, but I or joe could have a deeper understanding of the info, giving him or me a edge.
