		Little Johnny is rudely awoken from his slumber by the sound of knocking
at the door of his parents' home. The hammering noise permeates the fabric
of the semi-detached house, located in the picturesque English village of
Scunthorpe. From his bedroom, the toddler hears the front door opening,
followed by an angry discourse. Soon, his father's protestations are
replaced by the sound of jackboots marching upon the fashionable laminate
wood flooring of the hallway.<p>

Suddenly, the door to Little Johnny's bedroom bursts open and the
uninvited visitor approaches his bed. The frightened infant cowers and    
attempts to shield himself with his favourite stuffed toy as a large hand
reaches towards him. Johnny is surpised when, instead of trying to grab
him, the stranger tries to wrestle the toy from his grasp! Unwilling to
share his beloved friend with anyone, the child clings to his stuffed
companion with brave defiance. But then, without warning, the toy's head
tears loose in the stranger's hand and ejaculates stuffing onto the poor
toddler's blanket.<p>
Johnny looks down at the limp, broken body of his golliwog and begins to
cry...        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">This story may seem far-fetched, but sadly the truth is stranger than
fiction. Until recently, the golliwog was a popular toy which provided
innocent fun to many generations of children from all over the world. But
times have changed. The <A HREF="http://www.ferris.edu/news/jimcrow/golliwog/">much-loved golliwog</A> has now been demonised by the
liberals, and beaten with the rod of political correctness.<p>
The <A HREF="http://www.sterlingtimes.co.uk/golliwog.htm">proud history</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.kaleden.com/articles/472.html">golliwog</A> started with the character
<i>Golliwogg</i> in the <A HREF="http://www.teddybears.com/golliwog/4gw3a.html">childrens' stories</A> by Bertha Upton. The
character's name was a modified version of the phrase "Jolly Western
Oriented Gentleman", or "Jollywog" . It beggars belief that the liberals
view the golly as a racist artefact of unenlightened times. After all, the
unwieldy phrase "western oriented gentleman" bears a remarkable similarity
to many of the inoffensive terms used by the politically correct to
describe "persons of colour". And since when has jolity been an emotion  
that is commonly associated with racial oppression?<p>
In their attempts to enforce political correctness upon society, the
liberals have worked to eradicate all literary references to the golliwog.
It is ironic that their efforts to bowdlerise the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/1424/golly2.htm">works of
Enid Blyton</a> have proved to be even more racially insenstive than the  
golliwog ever was. For example, the home of the golliwogs in Blyton's
Noddy stories, <i>Golly Town</i>, was replaced by <i><a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/1424/g12.jpg">Monkey
Town</a></i>. This ham-fisted attempt at censorship only serves to
condition children to believe racist propaganda which claims that negroes
are monkeys. In many illustrations in Blyton's books, the golliwog has
been <a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/1424/g10.jpg">substituted
for a caucasian</a>. This echoes the unfortunate incident in which the <a href="http://www.ford.com">Ford Motor Company</a> replaced the faces of   
four black workers with "more acceptable" white faces in <a href="http://206.20.14.67/achal/archive/April96/image1.htm">promotional
photographs</a>.<p>
<IMG SRC="../../images/golly.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">Political correctness has also signalled the end to a great British
institution. For over 70 years, the golliwog <I>(pictured right)</I> has been the mascot of the <a href="http://www.ukgoods.com/robertsons.html">Robertson's Jams</a> and has
adorned every jar of marmalade sold by the company. Sadly, Golly's
days are numbered. Robertson's have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1505000/1505411.stm">decided to abandon</a> their venerable figurehead in favour of characters from <a href="http://www.sophie-dahl.com">Roald Dahl</a>'s books. While the
official reason for the golliwog's retirement is a lack of brand awareness
among children, it is clear that Golly's tarnished image is at least
partly responsible. But is the <a href="http://gollybadges1.moonfruit.com">Robertson's golliwog</a> really  
so bad? Let's look at the evidence:<p>
<ul>
<li>He is in gainful employment
<li>Until recently, he was sucessful in his career
<li>He's smartly dressed
<li>Golly is always happy
<li>He's <a href="http://www.my-home.demon.co.uk/gollyclub.htm">loved by millions.</a>
</ul><p>
Clearly, the golliwog is the perfect role model for black
children. If only these children chose to be more like Golly, rather than
emulating the tragic lives of <a href="http://www.notoriousonline.com">dead</a> <a href="http://www.tupac.com">rap musicians</a>, they could have a much
brighter future.<p>
The truth of the matter is that the golliwog's only crime is that the
liberals didn't invent him first. While the liberals' best attempt at
indoctrinating children to date was the ill-fated <i>Special Needs
Barbie</i> (complete with pink wheelchair, guide dog and full-time care
assistant figurine) and <i>Gimp Ken</i> (supplied with matching leg
callipers and crutches), the golliwog is the embodiment of Martin Luther
King Jr.'s <a href="http://web66.coled.umn.edu/new/MLK/MLK.html">dream</a>
of white and black children joining together in peace.<p>
If only we'd give him another chance, the loveable old golliwog can help
to stamp out racism by teaching children to ignore the colour of our skin.
Learning to <A HREF="http://www.gollyworld.co.uk">love Golly</A> could prove to be the first step on the road to
racial harmony.      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">...in that Opium <a href="http://www.sophie-dahl.com/">ad</a> (or "advert" as you would say), and comparing her with all those other pictures of her -- the ones where she is a <a href="http://www.sophie-dahl.com../../images/full-size/misc-2.jpg">cow</a> -- and I can't figure it out.   She is far, far thinner in the nude masturbation photo, first off.  Did she lose weight just for that one?  There are other nude photos of her where she is clearly quite obese, so I don't think being displayed totally naked to the entire world was a motivation for her to shed a pound or fifty.  It must have been that she would be photographed as a masturbator.  Anyone would want to be thin for that, obviously.   It is sort of the need to recover some pathetic shred of dignity in the midst of total humiliation.
<BR><BR>
The other thing is that in the Opium masturbation photo her face looks totally different too.  Upon examining the other pictures, I was shocked to see that she is unmistakably an Englishwoman, with all the unpleasantness that implies.  
<BR><BR>
Perhaps the masturbation photo was changed using computer graphics technologies, to remove both her unsighly fat  belly and her English facial features as well.  But the article already covered this kind of photo modification so I won't go into it.
<BR><BR>
The one thing that I was surprised was not discussed in this article was the use of photographs of fat women masturbating on bill-boards in the United-Kingdom, England, and Scotland.  I'm pretty certain here in a normal country we never, ever have photographs depicting <i>any</i> type of masturbation on bill-boards.  Why was this glossed over in this article?
<BR><BR>
Anyway, I'm thankful to Adequacy.edu for bringing this interesting state of affairs to my attention.  Normally someone from one of the less important parts of the world like Sophie Dahl would never be heard of here in USia, leaving us with a far smaller pool of freaks and unnatural aberations to gawk at than we have here.  I can only say that I hope to see links so more of the same in the future, although natrually I wouldn't want to see an excessive number women with such English faces (the English <a href="http://www.sophie-dahl.com../../images/full-size/mc06004.jpg">chin, lips, and freakishly-spaced eyes</a> are what I'm referring to mostly, you no doubt are aware).<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

BTW, Ms Dahl is truly delightful, and I think your comments about her weight are both unkind and uncalled for.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">She is indisputably English, and there's nothing to be done about that -- other than the obvious necessity of some photoshopping to de-Anglicize her features enough for wide public viewing.  I don't see how a woman who is comfortable masturbating nude in public would have any qualms about a simple statement of fact.
<BR><BR>
As far as her weight, she is, if you like, a "full-sized" woman.  She is clearly quite comfortable with herself and seems to have no problem at all with her weight.  Other than during her voluptous surging towards self-induced orgasm in full public view, as previously analyzed, of course.  Perhaps it is the word "cow" you object to.  
<BR><BR>
Why should I apologize for what is obviously a misogynistic denegration of all things female that originated in <i>your</i> mind, not in my writings?  She is cow-like.  We can all (if we are rational) agree to that.  That you have a sexist cow-phobic reaction to the word is not something I can be responsible for.  While I'm tempted to launch into a long tirade intended to educate you on the worth and dignity of cows, I think it would be a waste of time.  You have a bull-centric view of cattle, and if you haven't yet realized the kind of contradictions implied by that, I cannot in a few short minutes change your mind.
<BR><BR>
I would only ask that you at least take a look around.  Sure, maybe most of the traditional roles of power and honor in our half-civilized culture are played by bulls, but cows are just as important, and every day, cows prove that they are just as capable, just as strong, and just as intelligent as any bull.
<BR><BR>
"Cow" is a word of <i>pride</i> in today's world, and will be even more so in tomorrow's world.  I'm sorry that you haven't seen it this way, but I'm grateful for a forum like Adequacy that let's us excange our opposing views peacefully.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>
