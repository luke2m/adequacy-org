		<P>The twentieth century has seen a resurgance of ignorance and a wholescale attack on scientific advances led equally by the religious right and the green left. Whereas once people looked to science to solve all of our problems, today they see only scare stories spread by anti-humanists - that nuclear power is unsafe, that global warming is a real and that biotechnology is unsafe and uncontrollable.

<P>Here I make the case that another of the twentieth's greatest strawmen is in reality the <I>only</I> way for humanity to overcome the socioeconomic and biological problems facing it at the start of a new millenium, and that those who oppose it are at best short-sighted fools and at worst traitors to the human race. Indeed, eugenics is the only <I>humane</I> solution to these problems.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><P>Eugenics is the scientific study of improving the human gene pool through selective breeding. Today, with advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering coming faster and faster, I would also include such technologies as integral and valuable parts of a modern eugenics program.

<UL>
<LI><B>It is cruel to allow those with serious genetic defects to breed</B>

<P>Here we are talking about those who themselves are healthy but possess the genes that can lead to debilitating conditions in their children, such as cystic fibrosis or Down's syndrome. In the first case it may seem cruel to forbid license to the parents to try for a child - they are capable of raising one and may dearly wish to do so. However, letting them go ahead with the genetic lottery is far crueller - better not to try in the first place than to try and fail, ending up with the loss of a life, something which has no place in any moral eugenics movement. Until such time as hereditary diseases can be detected and corrected, such people should instead opt for adoption of healthy, genetically strong children.<P>

<LI><B>It is cruel to allow spastics to breed</B>

<P>Spastics on the other hand, are quite simply <I>not</I> capable of raising a child. Indeed, they are incapable of even understanding the potential consequences of having sex, and for someone with limited mental capabilities, being impregnated must be hugely upsetting and confusing. The child itself will almost certainly carry and show the same deficienes, leading to a perpetuating cycle of misery and public health burden. Any caring person can see that in this case, sterilisation of spastics allows them to continue leading as normal a lifestyle as they can without the burden a child would place.<P>

<LI><B>It is cruel to allow the poor to breed</B>

<P>Already cities across the world heave with the starving masses, and millions are moving into the city every day. Increasing populations have led to a rise in territorial and sectarian violence, and in a thousand bloody conflicts refugees have fled their traditional homes and looked to the city as a refuge. Unfortunately, even in the richest nations of the Western world, there is only so much in the way of resource to go around and many lead lives of poverty and suffering. Is it right that these people, no matter how good their <I>intentions</I> are (remember what paves the road to Hell!), be allowed to inflict their misery and squalor upon an innocent child?

<P>No, it is not. To bring a child into the world without the means to support it is wrong, and these people should not be able to breed.<P>

<LI><B>It is cruel to allow a child to be inferior</B>

<P>With a finite amount of resources and an ever-increasing population to compete over these, your child needs every advantage they can get to ensure they can seize as much of the pie as possible. Allowing the laws of genetics to have their way can equally result in a genius, an athlete or a simpleton. We use technology in every other way to cheat Nature, why do we have such a foolish fear when it comes to our children!

<P>It is cruel to risk that a child be inferior, that it suffer the taunts and risks that it cannot deal with. Indeed, why should we settle even for mediocrity when the means to greatness are almost within our technological grasp? Numerous studies have shown that brigher, smarter and better-looking children acheive better careers, have more rewarding social lives, have more chance of finding and then keeping a long-term partner, and claim to be happier.

<P>Are <I>you</I> cruel enough to deny this to your children?
</UL>

As I have shown, eugenics is not the Nazi science that the ignorant portray it as. Applied compassionately, eugenics has the potential to ensure richer, fuller lives for all of those born by reducing the element of chance that can so easily damn a newborn to a life without hope. Why should we continue to allow children to be born into a lifetime of suffering? As a moral human being, I say we <I>cannot</I> continue this way.

<P>So what is the way forward? The only rational and ethical way to acheive the goal of a perfect humanity is the introduction of Breeding Licenses which prospective parents must obtain from the State in order to breed. This can be enforced through temporary chemical sterlisation, which also has the benefit of eliminating unwanted pregnancy, a common occurance in the uneducated poor. In order to obtain a license I would suggest a series of tests and conditions:

<UL>
<LI>The parents both undergo medical examination to be sure they do not have any genetic diseases, no matter how "recessive" they may be. There is no sense in merely delaying the problem for a future generation; this is precisely what we are setting out to avoid!

<P>Of course, we can all hope that future advances in genetic engineering make the need for denying parents unnecessary. When it comes to the point where all such maladies can be corrected, we will no longer have to deny parents who have been so cruelly tainted by Nature.<P>

<LI>Additionally, to ensure that the child has all of the material and emotional support that it needs to grow up to be a healthy, happy and productive member of society, the parents should undergo both means testing and psychological testing by experts. After all, no matter how good the genetic stock of the child is, if it grows up in poverty or with abusive parents it cannot be expected to fufill its true potential, and being intelligent will undoubtedly recognise this and suffer.

<P>Parents who fail either of these tests will be refused the right to have children, although they may attempt to better themselves and retry later on.<P>

<LI>Finally parents must either agree to a set of desired traits for their child or to let these things be determined randomly (within a specific set of good traits of course). Undoubtedly parents will choose a phenotype that maximises their child's quality of life and choice of reproductive partners. Qualities that hamper a child in life - obesity, shortness, short-sightedness, ginger hair and so on - can be eliminated once and for all.

Optionally the State may require a small charge to cover administrative costs. Parents who truly want a child will be glad to pay such a small fee to cover the costs, and parents who are tight with their money over such a trivial matter are likely to be tight with their money when it comes to their children.

<P>In conclusion is it plain that despite popular hysteria, eugenics is both <I>practical</I> and <I>compassionate</I>. For anything to be of worth, and most parents would agree that having children is worth almost anything, must be fought for, not handed out according to Nature's sexual lottery. And by advocating eugenics you are fighting for a brighter future, both for your children and for the human race as a whole.

<P>No cause could be more moral. No cause could be more loving.      <br><br></div>

The mere annunciation of the opinion in support of eugenics demonstrates the inferior and perverted mind of these people, who under their own rule, as such, should not be allowed to breed.  To believe that one can breed out "bad" genes, is just simply a silly neo-darwinian misunderstanding of early genetics ala Mendel.  <BR>
<BR>
To believe eugenics would actually make the world a better place is an even worse error on many levels.  Think about who would never have lived...

<BR>
I agree whole-heartedly with you on this one. The only point I would not agree with is the direct genetic engineering part; however, I am not totally against it.<BR>
<BR>
This kind of thing must be done in order to preserve the human race. We are currently de-evolving!<BR>
<BR>
Normally creatures evolve, because the weak die off, as they are unable to sustain themselves, and the stronger prevail. Because of society interfering with evolutions natural course, the human race is in a sad state and worsening state.<BR>
<BR>
Normally a retard would die on its own. It could not support itself. Do not say it is evil or wrong or playing god to prevent defective children from being born, because guess what, we are playing god by helping them live! Look at all the aid society gives retards. Look at all the drugs to counter genetic diseases we have created, without which many people would have died LONG ago, far before they were able to breed.<BR>
<BR>
Preventing these children from being born is giving them each a gift -- A gift of non-suffering.<BR>
<BR>
Although I am highly intelligent, and competent physically, I have a few defects which plague me. I am; however, able to support myself, and am actually quite successful. I choose not to take any drugs to counter these things, because doing so is unnatural and is a pain in itself. This brings me pain and torture at times. <BR>
<BR>
Because I love myself, and would love my children, I decided to give them the greatest gift I can give them. The gift of not being born into pain and suffering. I have convinced my wife of this, and if she agrees and also doesn't really want kids (she likes driving her Porsche and my BMW at times, that we easily afforded because we are not wasting our money on supporting defective children). If her natural instincts ever take hold, and she wants children, she agreed to adopt.<BR>

In fact, our lack of understanding of genetics is only beginning to become more and more apparent.  Wow, we completed the human genome project - we still have no clue what is really means or how to interpret the genetic code.  What we have figured out only barely scratches the surface, and we still do not know the mechanism by which many genes do their thing.<BR><BR>
And what about cancer?  Perhaps you're overlooking the concept that this is becoming more and more prevalent because our genetics are trying out new mutations, many of which were brought about by "environmental" factors, a sign of evolution in process.<BR><BR>

This has nothing to do with eugenics. You can't breed out poverty, it's not genetically transfered. Simple breeding limits on all of the population will reduce poverty. Why waste potentialy productive genes due to a state brought on by environmental conditions? This would be like banning people with non-congenital deformities (severe burns for instance) from breeding. One could make a damn good case that surviving poverty or mutilation indicates a certain genetic ruggedness.

Stupid people are far more likely to be poor. Stupidity is genetic! That is a know fact! Although it is possible for a bright individual to be poor, it is much more unlikely than a dumb person to achieve the same low.<BR>
<BR>
Your comparison only works to illustrate how stupid you are, instead of illustrating your point. Someone having burn injuries is way more accidental than genetic, although a retard would be more likely to severely burn itself than a normal intelligent human. Someone being poor is not as much an accident; it is most likely because the person is unintelligent, physically inept, or other such things.<BR>

They'll still exist mind you, but my solution will help sidestep the issue of what happens when superior genes get mixed in with the lower class.
<br><br>
Basically the plan works like this: If you get shafted in life, and end up being poor, you can "opt-out" of that stage in life.  Provided you and your family pass vigorous mental and physical exams, you will trade jobs, salaries and real estate with a childless couple of the upper-middle class.  They obviously aren't needing the extra money, and, furthermore, they must have faulty genes for <i>not wanting children</i> in the first place.
<br><br>
Now, I know what you're thinking, and yes, it is rare to find workable genes in the poor, but if this program results in even <i>one</i> decent human being, it will be worth it and justified.  After all, can you put a price on a superior genes?<BR><br>c'mon, lower.<BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I think that we should keep a stupid underclass who would perform tasks that our eugenic children should not have to.  For example you could breed a type of person with a poor sense of smell, but with strong arms and decent driving skills who would perform garbage collection and janitorial duties.  And for the checkout line you could breed a person who is physically unfit but good at simple arithmetic.  Since this person would be of low intelligence, it would be easy to brainwash them into not stealing from their employers.<BR>
<BR>
Sci-fi movies depict robots taking over our burdensome chores, but let's face it.. robots have a long way to go.  We have, right now, the perfect robot: The Stupid Human.  Let's take advantage of this opportunity to create a happy, yet stupid underclass!<BR>
<BR>
BTW, one precaution we should take is to not allow these people to vote, or we might end up with a USian President like Al Gore or George W. Bush!!!  What a nightmare that would be!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Nuclear power (as in using Nuclear Fission) in its present form IS dangerous.<BR>
<BR>
Nobody yet knows how to dispose of radioactive waste (apart from just storing it and expecting many future generations to look after it!)<BR>
<BR>
Also... no matter how fail-safe you make a nuclear reactor there is still the issue of acts of stupidiy like terrorism or even just plain old human error.<BR>
<BR>
I find it bizarre that governments in many countries still persist with nuclear fission for generating electricity without looking at alternatives like geothermal power.<BR>

Ok it might be expensive to build a geothermal power station... but so is building a nuclear one!<BR>
