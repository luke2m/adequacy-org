		As the United States continues to wreak <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/14/international/asia/14MILI.html">terrible
vengeance</a> upon Afganistan for Osama bin Laden's <a href="http://pf.johncglass.com/war">cowardly and despicable acts</a>, we
draw ever nearer to a decision upon which the fate of the world is
balanced like a <a href="http://www2.gol.com/users/pbw/sumo.htm">sumo
wrestler</a> on his tip-toes. This reckoning will come when bin Laden is
within the power of the U.S.--an inevitability, as the civilized world
cannot accept less than full victory in this war. Some woefully misguided
analysts, including <a href="http://www.whitehouse.com">George
W. Bush</a>, have called for bin Laden's head on a <a href="http://www.infomaniak.ch/~lug/texts/ow_salome.htm"> silver
platter</a>. But making a martyr of bin Laden would be the worst mistake
the U.S. could make.

<p>The only moral course of action is to capture bin Laden and bring him
to trial. Then the real work of justice begins.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">The consequences of killing Osama bin Laden would be <a href="http://battlefieldearth.warnerbros.com/index_html.html">disastrous</a>. As
a result of his success in attacking the "<a href="http://www.80s.com/Icons/Bios/mohammed_reza_shah_pahlavi.html">Great
Satan</a>," the Saudi terrorist is a hero to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46654-2001Oct11.html">millions
of Muslims</a> around the world. The Taliban has already declared
<i>jihad</i>, or holy war, upon the United States, signaling the beginning
of new efforts to attack our homeland. The death of such an admired
figure, far from halting this terrorism, would simply encourage greater
violence in reaction--<a href="http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/force/node4.html">Newton's Third
Law</a> applied to global politics. Most dire of all, bin Laden's
martyrdom would precipitate a political struggle likely ending the
ascendancy of Muslim radicals in Pakistan, a nuclear power. <a href="http://www.bible-prophecy.com/ww3.htm">World War III</a> could be
around the corner.

<p>Bin Laden has dumped a can of gasoline on Uncle Sam; proponents of
assassination advise lighting a match.

<p>Cultural ignorance is ultimately at the root of the calls for bin
Laden's assassination. Death in <i>jihad</i>, for a Muslim, means
immediate ascension to a <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/k/koran/browse.html">heaven</a> of tasty
fruit and nubile virgins. Bin Laden, or indeed any Muslim terrorist, can
imagine no fate more agreeable than a glorious death in <i>jihad</i>. As
Israel has learned from its <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_1016000/1016070.stm">numerous
assassinations</a> of terrorists, certain death only attracts Muslims like teenage girls to a <a href="http://www.nsync.com/MASTER_frameset.htm">Backstreet Boys</a> concert.

<p>Even if assassination were not so ill-advised for practical reasons, it
would not be just. Following the <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=DIV2&byte=307788">biblical
law</a> of "an eye for an eye," the most just death for bin Laden would be
collapsing a 110-story building on him approximately 6000 times. But this
would no more be justice than it would be feasible. For when the World
Trade Center collapsed, not only did thousands of Americans perish, but so
too perished the loves, hopes, and dreams of countless others, whether
they be the family and friends of the victims, the hundreds of thousands now
waiting in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/12/business/12ECON.html?searchpv=past7days">unemployment
lines</a>, or those millions who suffered through the <a href="./2001.10.7.133026.501.html">cancellationof their favored sporting events</a>. Instead of healing the life-long
wounds of 260 million Americans, killing bin Laden would trivialize our
suffering by supposing that we have achieved some form of closure through
his mere execution.

<p>Clearly, then, our efforts must be focused on bringing bin Laden to
trial in the United States. But after his conviction, we cannot execute
him, or we again create a martyr; we might as well share a collective
glass of poisoned <a href="http://www.kool-aid.com/">Kool-Aid</a>.

<p>But can we allow bin Laden, the biggest mass-murderer in history, to
rot away in the relative comfort of <a href="http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/losch.html">federal prison</a>? Let us
not forget that this terrorist has spent recent years of his life in
luxurious Afgan caves. While it would not be as attractive an option as
glorious death for Muslim fanatics, federal prison is a marked improvement
over the conditions in, for example, the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/we.html">West
Bank</a>. Such a mild punishment is no punishment at all for most
Muslims. We cannot afford to issue such an open invitation for terrorists to target America.

<p>No, there is only one punishment for bin Laden both practical and just:
torture.

<p>There is no question that torture is the most--indeed, the
<i>only</i>--efficacious deterrent for terrorism. As matters stand, the
worst that a terrorist has to fear is failing in his mission and falling
short of heaven. But what terrorist would attack the United States knowing
that he would suffer decades of <a href="http://www.hell.com/">hell</a>
before reaching the bliss of <a href="http://www.paradise.com/">paradise</a>?  More likely, he would seek
quick gratification at the expense of Israel or local politicians.

<p>Furthermore, torture comes closest to achieving justice for the
thousands who died on September 11. Although bin Laden's punishment would
be a pale shadow of the suffering of countless Americans, while he yet
lives, his hoarse screams would serve as balm to the deep psychological
wounds we all suffer. Could we say the same of a <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2001/09/19/bowden/index.html">Delta Force</a> bullet or a
<a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/lethal-injection.htm">quick jab with a needle</a>?

<p>The many well-established methods of torture provide a wide array of
options for the United States; among U.S. allies, Israel has a
particularly <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/middle_east/newsid_637000/637293.stm">deep
reservoir of experience</a> to draw upon. Yet we must ensure that the
torture not be too physically taxing, risking bin Laden's
untimely death. Therefore, however satisfying they might be for
spectators, we must categorically rule out <a href="http://shanmonster.bla-bla.com/witch/torture/burning.html">burning
him at the stake</a>, drawing and quartering, or flaying his skin from his
body. Even breaking bones, <a href="http://www.torturerackscenes.com/">stretching him on the rack</a>,
and burning his skin with hot pokers could have deleterious effects on his
health, and should only be employed after consultation with government
physicians. Consequently, relatively moderate physical torture must be
supplemented by appropriate <a href="http://goatse.cx">psychological
measures</a>. But there can be no doubt that the infliction of substantial
suffering on bin Laden would be well within our power.

<p>Unquestionably, many <a href="http://canada.gc.ca/">foreigners</a> and <a href="http://www.zmag.org/ZNET.htm">leftists</a> would question the
morality of such measures. But these naive spectators must realize that we
live in a different world than that of September 10. With the attacks on
New York, the rules of engagement changed. We can no longer afford the
luxury of seeing the world through rose-colored glasses of the framers of
the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm">Geneva
Convention</a>. We must find the courage and fortitude to do what must be done. A failure to act is to invite further tragedy.      <br><br></div>

Personally, I'd like to see bin Laden working to pay the mortgage on a middle class United States house in one of the cities which have been so egregiously defiled. Of course, that would simply not work, as he'd probably starve himself to death first. It's unlikely that he'd even give half a shit about maintaining his family and financial stability, given his blatant dementia. Still, if he were to live as a plebeian, things might at least have the possibility of changing. As it stands now, he appears to me as a rich bastard no different than corporate whores in this country.

<BR><BR>
The pigskin and blood attacks would be rather ironic. They look at us as swine, so we use swine to defile them and cut them down to the same level that we're supposedly at. People around the world have their heads stuck in the sand. They don't deserve exemption.

Does bin Laden live in squalid magnificence? Where are his cars, high class hos and diamond encrusted molars? If he truly is as dedicated to his ideals, then financial stability would not matter. Fundamentalist Islamics don't have such strong ties to earthly existence due to their religious belief, so they are not perturbed when family and friends die as we are. Money is simply a tool, so it will only be acquired out of necessity, won't it? Of course, that is again assuming (dangerous to assume, but hypothetical at this point) that they are as true to their faith as they would have us believe. Unless you can explain your opposing view to me in a reasonable manner, don't post.


<BR><BR>
How did bin Laden earn his money? Drug trafficking? Was it the massive inheritance that his father left him? What proves that he's good with money? The fact that he doesn't use any of it for purposes other than survival and weapons? Of course, that is an exemplary persuit and all citizen of the United States would do well to follow his lead.


<BR><BR>
Were I to drop you into a pit of hungry alligators and you somehow survive, would you be able to do it again? The financial world can be very similar. Note that I said <em>can</em>. Don't get all bent out of shape thinking that I am making an absolute blanket statement.


<BR><BR>
If bin Laden were to start over again, he'd have to scrape for the same crumbs that the lower and middle classes strive for. He is human.


<BR><BR>
<cite>Still, if he were to live as a plebeian, things might at least have the possibility of changing.</cite>


<BR><BR>
Was that an absolute statement? No, it wasn't, was it? Anything is possible, but I made no suggestion as to it being guaranteed or even more than marginally likely. Also note the very first word of my comment - <em>Personally</em>. I am not forcing my ideas upon you, so where is there reason to spit venom? Please, before you jump into the fray, observe and take rational action. I try to, so at least have the decency to attempt matching that. Now I've made my explanation. Make yours, but keep it civil.


<BR><BR>
I don't know what you've experienced, but the people I've made associations and friends with are very tolerant and understanding individuals. Typical Americans may be racist, but that doesn't mean a reasonably intelligent person won't dismiss them and draw his own conclusions. Still, I can't disagree with you. It would very probably make him even worse. His view of Americans would simply be reinforced and his inhuman actions justified by his rationale.


<BR><BR>
Regardless, no matter how wonderful bin Laden may be as a person, his actions (not even including the WTC/Pentagon atrocity) indicate a vile, contemptible mentality. Ours as a people is not to judge (but we do anyway), yet he does so in extreme.

People who would work themselves into a religious fever with dreams of ISLAMIC Paradise, and Literally Run AMOK, killing everyone within reach. So inspired were they that you not only had to kill him, you had to push him over. It was MOKERS that forced the U.S. Army to adopt the .45 Colts Automatic Pistol M-1911. What stopped them was the tactic of Wrapping one of these MOKERS (After you capture him and yes it was possible) in the skin of a freshly killed pig and hanging him in Public view.

From all reports a good portion of Islam is against the terrorists and wishes them in Hell as much as we do. Hmmm, One might consider dressing all Target buildings with pictures of Pigs, but that would go a bit too far. What I propose might look silly to a Westerner, However it is Deadly Serious and FRIGHTENING to a TRUE BELIEVER. As you Said, This goes beyond Justice, I say it is a matter of Honor and Blood.

Well, my understanding of it is pretty rudimentary(though not as rudimentary as yours.  Oh no.  Heavens no.  I could never ever be that wrongheaded), but I believe that in the Islamic version of heaven, the "nubile virgins" aren't actually humans -- they're houris, kind of like angels that exist only for the purposes of sexual pleasure.  Granted, this is equally creepy.  There are male equivalents as well, to keep the ladies happy.<BR><BR>

&quot;If you are a good Muslim, when you make it to heaven, you will be pleasured eternally by the fembots!&quot;  I suppose it at least has the advantage of realism.  The Christian heaven makes no provision for sexual satisfaction, and an eternity of celibacy never sounded that great to me.  (Too much like high school.)  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

The British tortured and imprisoned IRA men in Northern Ireland. The result: new IRA operatives appeared. The Israelis have systematically mistreated the Palestinians. I don't exactly notice their victory over them. The KGB tortured Soviet dissidents. That's why the Soviet Union is so strong and free of internal disorder today. Oh, yes, and the British made widespread use of torture against dissent in India and what is now Pakistan, which is why they were able to hold on to their empire until the present day.

In that liberal, sick-making book the Bible, there is the story of Samson. Samson was a Jewish terrorist who mass-murdered Palestinians. When they caught him, they blinded him and subjected him to verbal abuse and hard labor. P.S. It didn't stop Jewish aggression, and it is clearly suggested in the story that their tactics were flawed.<BR>

I find this Biblical "analysis" (obviously written by someone who never attended Sunday School, much less engaged in any kind of serious study) to be highly alarming. 

<BR><BR>Samson was waging a holy war to save the Israelites from the Philistines, who worshipped the false god Dagon. He was seduced <i>away</i> from God's path, which meant he lost his God-given strength to fight the worshippers of the false god. The story clearly implies that the ultimate fate of the Philistines had nothing to do with the "tactics" of the Philistines or further "terrorism" of the Jews. It was a simple matter of the strength of Samson's faith, and the enactment God's inexorable will.

<BR><BR>Your hidden agenda seems to be to insinuate that God is, in fact, on the side of bin Laden and the terrorists, just as he was on the side of Samson and the Jews a few thousand years ago. But if you are a believer, surely you realize that a just God would never support the brutal, senseless killings of innocents. No religion would claim bin Laden is supported by God. Allah does not support bin Laden, nor does Jesus, nor does Yahweh.

<BR><BR>As for your bizarre insistance that the physical suffering of a guilty individual is a tremendous moral evil beyond starving millions of Iraqi children...I truly have no response to such an appalling viewpoint.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I didn't make any comment about relative evil. You seem to confuse a belief that torturing terrorists will not eliminate terrorism (which I hold) with some kind of moral relativism. Sorry, that's rubbish. It is perfectly possible to be deeply opposed to evil, and to want to see it stamped out, while having grave doubts about the effetiveness of the methods someone wants to employ.<BR>
<BR>
As for Biblical scholarship...well, my Hebrew is rusty nowadays and my Greek is weak, but I _do_ have a degree in theology. By any modern standards, Samson was a terrorist. He killed palestinians (=philistines) because of his fundamentalist religious beliefs (just like OBL). He was captured by them and tortured, and eventually died. His people then put spin on the story and turned him into a hero martyr. Several thousand years later the fundamentalist Israelis are still beating seven sorts of shit out of the Palestinians. My case rests. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Of course the next wave of terrorists, mindful of Laden's fate, would be carrying cyanide pills, or just blow themselves to smithereens in crowded areas.<BR>

I hate to say it, but the only "cure" for terrorism is either the discrete elimination of all terrorists and people associated with them in any way whatsoever, or the removal of any reason for terrorists to target the state you're interested in protecting.<BR>

Both are, shall we say, long term propositions.<BR>

That's the point. This is not about vengeance. This is about protecting the world from an exceedingly dangerous man who has proven time and time again that the only thing that will ever stop him is death.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

A list of pre-selected "procedures" could be chosen in a nationwide online vote, and then the funds from the TV special could be donated to the victims' families of Sept. 11.<BR>
And for good measure, the finishing touch would have to be a nice, old fashioned Levi Strauss-style drawing and quartering of each, and THEN the pigs could be brought in to clean up the mess.<BR>

Also, using religious means (pig products and the likes) would also be an act of genious. Since the WTC attack - and indeed this entire conflict - is based on religious and cultural differences, widening that gap REALLY should solve the problem.<BR>

In case you haven't noticed, the 6,000 dead folks in New York don't have the opportunity to speak for themselves, so it is up to the rest of the populace to do so on their behalf.<BR>
The ghastly attacks that these freaks perpetrated on the 11th have gone just a LITTLE farther than simply killing thousands of innocent people and shattering families; they pissed us off.<BR>
Now it is time for payback, and sorry for you in your cute, furry little world, there isn't any way we can make it pleasant.<BR>
It's called war, and the point is to win, you stupid dolt.<BR>

<BR>
I AM, however, concerned over the general ignorance desplayed towards the underlying problems at hand. If you believe that Bin Laden is the problem, you are sadly naive. Bin Laden is only the surface - he's only this years T-shirt. Next year, someone else will emerge and release smallpox in the air condition system at LAX or blow up the Space Neadle with homemade C4. This will happen wether or not we get our petty revenge on Bin Laden.<BR>
<BR>
Attacking a single symptom of a decease instead of the decease itself is what I - a poor clueless dolt - object to. But that's just me.<BR>

Now that you mention it, what ARE the underlying problems at hand? Too much freedom? Too many sport-utility vehicles? Brittany Spears? Give the masses on the East and West coasts a little more credit. Our populace isn't as ignorant as you're assuming.<BR>
I will be the first to agree that the disease is the problem, not the symptom. As our fearless leader has stated, we're in this for the long haul. Bin Laden is the first in a long line of stepping stones that (hopefully) have an end. What happens along the walk that our country and our military are taking will be seen.<BR>
