        <div class="q">
		As I fully expected when I understook the task of writing a scientific essay for
America's most controversial Weblog, reaction to the first part of my controversial
essay <a href="./2001.8.31.42018.3684.html"> GlobalWarming: A Proactive Solution</a> was strong and varied.  Exactly as I predicted, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672319896/ref=pd_gw_cp_5/103-5622495-9666217">
Liberals</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0913022101/qid=999397282/sr=2-1/103-5622495-9666217">
Conservatives</a> were both harshly critical of the piece, with the Liberals ranting that
the essay was far too Conservative and the Conservatives believing that the essay
was a piece of Liberal propoganda.  This proves quite clearly one of the first points I
made in Part 1: that the <a href="http://www.lp.org/quiz/">fracturization of the political
landscape</a> into warring camps is ultimately counterproductive and leads otherwise
rational people to behave as political demagogues enslaved to their particular
<i>Zeitgeist</i> rather than acting together in unity with the rest of humanity to solve
the serious problems facing the world here in the first year of the 21st century.

<br><br>

I was not expecting, though, to have to deal with the number of mail bombings, death
threats, harassing messages over ICQ, and harassing phone calls that I received over
the past 36 hours.  I knew that many people would disagree with my message, but it
was silly of me to believe that those people would have the capacity to react to
something they disagree with in a way that's tactful, productive, or even legal.

<br><br>

In addition to those who were merely fearful of my message of <a href="http://www.msf.ca../../images/world.gif">unity</a>, there were several
self-proclaimed "<a href="http://timecube.com/index15.html">scientists</a>" and "<a href="http://thegreatestthinker.com/">intellectuals</a>" who challenged my
well-researched scientific facts.  Although many of these people were deliberately
posting misinformation in order to cause trouble (such as those posting fake definitions
of "aerobic" and "anaerobic" with the words reversed), some wrote some genuine,
although often misinformed, critiques of the work.  I spent a great deal of time
researching each of the objections that was raised to determine which of them had
merit and which did not, and my first objective here in Part 2 is to deal with those
objections one by one before I proceed to the plan itself.        </div>

<br><br>

A general note to all the scientific "elites" who hold themselves above other people: 
<a href="http://www.cooldegree.com/">your college degree</a> does not make you
better than other people.  It does not mean you corner the market on truth.  Just as
Adequacy's <a href="./2001.8.5.172749.2140.html">BuildingYour Dream PC</a> (which was a VERY helpful article intended to cut through all the
technobabble and elitism and geek clique-ness) prompted a mountain of responses
from pseduo-intellectual "<a href="http://www.lpi.org/">Information Technology
Professionals</a>" telling the author how absolutely wrong he was about every tiny
detail, so the same happened with my article.  The "intellectuals" grew jealous about
someone trying to bring their "exclusive knowledge" to the masses.  With DMG's
article, he was trying to bring PC building (formerly an "only for us!" hobby among <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">elitist geeks</a>) to normal people who have a life in
the outside world, while my attempts to bring some scientific knowledge to normal
people with real jobs and real lives who don't wear pocket protectors and run
Communist OS's.  This prompted outraged response from the scientific elites who
were threatened that the scientific establishment's stranglehold on science might be
cast into doubt.  It's time for the elitism in the world to be torn down bit by bit.  And if I
get a few details wrong here and there, or forget to explain that the third coefficient of
Martin's Conjectural Gravitational Formula has no positive cubic root over the domain
where energy output is inversely proportional to the negative cotangent of the
displacement triangle, it's because I'm writing for <b>normal people</b> who don't
need to know every detail, they just need to know what's going on. 

<br><br>

I believe that once I present the details of my plan, everybody who insulted me for
getting one or two chemical formulas wrong is going to be feeling a little bit bad for
having insulted the guy who disproved the Global Warming threat.

<br><br>

I will go ahead and correct a few specific errors I made, and respond to some of the
other accusations that were made against me. I know that I'm not perfect.  I did make
several minor errors in my original essay.  Although there weren't nearly as many as
some critics would have had you believe, I do regret the errors I made, and I'm going
to provide retractions for them now.

<b>Logical Facilities</b>: It turns out that I was in error about these.  They're not
actually called "Logical Facilities", they're really called "Logical Fallacies," and they're
bad things, rather than good things as I originally stated.  This was due to a simple
misunderstanding during my research.  The font size on one web site I visited was too
small, and I misread "fallacies" as "facilities" and "they are to be avoided" as "they are
to be avowed."

<br><br>

And to the person who called me "a [L]ibertarian whose first-year-philosophy-class
ideals blind him to the fact that global warming will have huge impacts on the global
environment and economy," I'll have you know that I am <b>not</b> a Libertarian with
first-year-philosophy-class ideals.  I dropped my first-year philosophy class because
it was <a href="http://www.hamsterdance.org/">dumb</a>.

<br><br>

<b>Phrenology</b>: I appreciate the (mostly) polite and friendly e-mails I have
received from representatives of The North American Phrenology Consortium in the
wake of my essay being mentioned on their weblog.  The Phrenologists were quite
eloquent and erudite in defending their science, and I'd like to issue a formal apology
for lumping Phrenology in with the other junk sciences on my list.  Although I'm still not
convinced of the scientific accuracy of Phrenology, I now realize that there's room for
ambiguity and disagreement on the subject.

<br><br>

And regarding the e-mail from the gentleman who told me I have the cranial curvature
of an Italian Mafia goon with passive-aggressive tendencies, latent paedophilia, and a
possible abnormal fixation with Volvos-- wow, that stuff really <b>does</b> work!

<br><br>

<b>Mirrors coated with Ozone</b>: Well, according to several websites, I was right
about this, but in the name of scientific accuracy, I found an old handmirror and
cracked it with a brick.  I couldn't find any evidence of Ozone.  Maybe I was wrong, or
maybe there are just different kinds of mirrors.

<br><br>

<b>Newton's Laws vs the Laws of Thermodynamics</b>:  I feel really bad about this
one, because I consider Thermodynamics to be one of my major areas of expertise. 
This was a very bad typographical error on my part.

<br><br>

<b>"Dealing with Depression" in New Hampshire</b>: Your e-mail brought a tear to
my eye.  No, it's not wrong of you to avoid dating so soon after your terrible loss. 
Your friends are doing you a great disservice by not respecting your wishes in the
matter.  I'd suggest you steer clear of those friends and get involved with like-minded
social groups in your area.  You can't take away the pain or hide from it, but seeking
out new hobbies and companions in life can help you to heal.  It's normal to not want
to seek out a new romantic relationship after such a tragic loss of your beloved, and
you shouldn't do anything that feels wrong.  You have to give yourself time to mourn. 
That may take a week or it may take a decade.  In matters of the heart, your heart is
the only guide.  If in the future you do strike up a new relationship similar to your old
one, get the goat vaccinated for Rabies early on to prevent this tragedy from
happening again.

<br><br>

Now, on to some of the other critiques I have received:

<br><br>

<blockquote>Nitrogen is the inert buffer gas in our atmosphere. Oxygen is about 20%,
and CO2 is less than 1%</blockquote>

This is why gaseous-state psychics is so complicated.  When you say "how much" of
a particular gas is in a mixture, there are several ways to measure that, and there are
several complex factors involved.  Different gasses have different densities, gas can
compress into a very small volume or expand into a very large volume, etc. 
Depending on what measurement system you use, both the critic and I are correct.  I
should have made the ambiguity clear in my original article.

<blockquote>Nitrogen is used by every plant and animal on this planet. This should be
obvious since it's a fertilizer.</blockquote>

I was referring not to various Nitrogen-based compounds, including the amino acids
you mentioned, Nitrite, Nitrate, etc., but to elemental Nitrogen (N2).  Yes, Nitrogen
compounds are certainly important to life.  I'd never say otherwise.  But molecular
Nitrogen certainly is not.


<blockquote>The Strong force is what holds together nuclei, not what causes
chemical bonding. A description of what causes chemical bonding would take far too
long, but the short version of it is: It arises only from the potential you would expect
from Coulomb's law (the law which describes  attraction of charges), and it's a
quantum-mechanical consequence of solving the Schrodinger equation.</blockquote>

I won't dispute that this is correct if you define "Strong Force" the way you do. 
However, you may not be aware of recent developments in Quantum Gravitational
Theory discoverd by researchers at <a href="http://www.princeton.com/">Princeton
University</a> that tie certain manifestations of the Strong Force inextricably into the
Schrodinger Equation in way that's far too complex to explain here.  Just last week,
the Nobel Institute called this discovery one of the most important steps toward a
Unified Field Theory, so you may want to read up on it.  Sorry if I jumped the gun a bit
on that and didn't provide the correct background information.

<blockquote>Ionic bonding can be described as "stealing" electrons. Covalent bonding
is "sharing", not stealing.</blockquote>

Once again, this is partially a matter of semantics.  Over the past four years or so
since the debut of <a href="http://www.modernhumorist.com/mh/0004/propaganda/mp3.jpg">Napster</a>,
the <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> crowd of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">anti-corporate</a> <a href="http://slashdot.org/index.pl?section=yro">pseduo-Libertarians</a> wants us to
believe that "stealing" should be referred to as "sharing."  I don't by into the hype: if
we're going to antropomorphise, I call co-valent bonding is "stealing" and ionic
bonding is "commerce."  Ionic bonding is "commerce" because one atom has
something it needs to get rid of (one or more electrons in its outer valence), and
another atom needs those electrons in order to complete its own outer valence.  A fair
exchange is made in which both atoms are enriched by making a fair exchange.  In
co-valent bonding, two or more atoms "communally own" one or more electrons. 
"Communal ownership" is one of the tenants of Communism, in which the public
steals all private property "to serve the public good," and the cries of "information is
owned by all of us" is the mating call of the sexually repressed Geeks who are trying
to undermine intellectual property and put content producers out of business.

<blockquote>Water is not a form of oxygen. It contains oxygen. That is not the same
thing as BEING oxygen. </blockquote>

You're absolutely right.  I'm sorry if the wording I used in my essay made this unclear.

<blockquote>A greenhouse gas is one which has certain absorbance/emission
properties when exposed to infrared radiation.</blockquote>

Of course greenhouse gasses absorb electromagnetic radiation in the infrared range. 
Otherwise the electromagnetic radiation would just pass through rather than being
absorbed.

<blockquote>Some greenhouse gases exist which are not lighter than
ozone.</blockquote>

If they're not lighter than Ozone, they won't rise above the Ozone in the atmosphere. 
Hence they won't be able to prevent the Ozone from reflecting (or as you put it,
"absorbing") the electromagnetic radiation.  I think you may want to think a little bit
about the logic (or lack thereof) behind your statement.

<blockquote>and some gases which are lighter than ozone don't absorb radiation in
the sun's wavelengths, and therefore don't cause emissions.</blockquote>

This is scientific elitism again. There's ALWAYS some substance that doesn't follow
the rules.  There's always an exception.  There's no need to explicitly mention that
fact, though.  I think most people will know that already.  We still say "anything with
mass cannot travel at or beyond the speed of light," even 22 years after Fermilab
proved the existence of the Tachyon, and we still speak of "centrifugal force" even
though we now know it's only an abstraction.

<blockquote>Ozone does not absorb in the visible range</blockquote>

I know perfectly well where visible light and infrared radiation fall relative to each other
on the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.  Some people will say that the word
"light" refers only to the visible wavelengths, while some people will say that all
electromagnetic radiation, even microwaves and radio signals, can be called "light." 
Again, pure semantics.  I generally refer to visible radiation as well as infrared and
ultraviolet radiation as "light," but that's purely a matter of opinion.  Also, using terms
like "visible range" smacks of Species Elitism.  What we call "visible light" might be
entirely invisible to the population of Alpha Centauri, who may very well be able to see
only X-rays.  We never know.  "Visible" is merely a semantic name we give in order to
make things easier on us, it in no way represents truth.

<blockquote>Algae is NOT a fungus!</blockquote>

That depends on how you define "fungus."  Toxonomy is a science that's subject to
much debate and elitism.  I'd argue with you further about this, but you're too much of
a fun guy.

<blockquote>The polar ice caps are HUGE</blockquote>

The reason you might think this is that you've been looking at maps, not globes. 
Trying to project an entire three-dimensional body onto a two-dimensional surface is
a science in and of itself, and most maps are wildly inaccurate because of it.  With
most common projection methods, the shapes and sizes of objects near the equator
are displayed fairly accurately, whereas the sizes of objects closer to the poles are
often <b>grossly</b> exaggerated in size.  Since the ice caps are located at the
poles, they look gigantic on a map, and even globes distort their size to some degree
because of the non-spherical shape of th Earth.  In reality, the <a href="http://yellow5.com/pokey/">North Polar Ice Cap</a> is about the size of
Nebraska, and the <a href="http://www.santa.com/">South Polar Ice Cap</a> is
about the size of Texas or Australia.

<br><br>

(As an aside, some newer map-making projection systems that have recently been
developed allow maps to be drawn that are more accurate than was ever before
possible.  However, people who see these maps often say they look unfamiliar,
distored, or just "wrong."  I think anything that makes <a href="http://www.canniballovers.com/melissa/blame_canada.htm">Canda</a> look
smaller has my ringing endorsement.)

<blockquote>Ozone does NOT stand for "Oxygen Zone"</blockquote>

According to the <a href="http://www.oed.com/">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, it
does.  Thanks for playing.

<br><br>

I think I've covered most of the objections I've received in pretty good detail.  Time for
business.

<br><br>

<i>7: THE PLAN</i>

<br><br>

First, I'll list all the some of the problems that this plan will solve, in order to give you a
rough outline of how it's going to go.

<br><br>

Problems caused directly by Global Warming:

<br><br>

<li>The polar ice caps will melt, causing the level of the ocean to rise to as high as
twenty feet above sea level.

<br><br>

<li>The earth's temperature will rise by as much as 10 degrees C, causing other,
related problems.

<br><br>

Other problems that are facing our world:

<br><br>

<li>Deforestation and a decrease in the amount of plant life on Earth is projected to
cause a shortage of Oxygen in the future.

<br><br>

<li>Much of the planet is uninhabitable desert due to a lack of fresh water.

<br><br>

<li>Many people in third-world countries are dying due to unavailability or
uncleanliness of water in their area.

<br><br>

<li>Star Ships and other advanced technologies that we build in the future will require
a great deal of fuel.

<br><br>

<li>There is not enough arable land in the world to produce enough food to feed the
entire world's growing population -- some say this is false, but people are obviously
starving to death.

<br><br>

<li>The world needs alternative energy sources to replace the diminishing supply of
fossil fuels.

<br><br>

Now, the plan:

<br><br>

<b>STEP ONE: Desalinization Plants</b>.  "Desalinization" is the process of
removing salt from ocean water to create clean, drinkable fresh water.  The first step is
to build lots and lots of Desalinization Plants on all the major coasts.  The United
States's <a href="http://www.bushgrammar.com/">President Bush</a> is probably
going to refer to "desalinization" as "desaltering", and since the United States is the
only country with the economic resources and infrastructure to build the number of
plants required, we'd better get used to that name.  From here on out, I will refer to
Desalinization Plants as <i>Desalterizers</i>.

<br><br>

If you've ever played Maxis's fine simulation game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004T1M7/qid=999405832/sr=2-1/ref=aps_sr_vg_1_1/103-5622495-9666217">
Simcity 3000 Unlimited</a> (or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004T0QS/qid=999405851/sr=2-1/ref=aps_sr_vg_1_1/103-5622495-9666217">this
version</a> if you're one of the 57 people in the world using <a href="./2001.8.31.16820.2342.html">Lignux</a>-- this is one of the 3 games that's available to you, published by a now-bankrupt company,
so you're not getting any more), you'll know that there are three basic ways to get
fresh water: drilling down to the water table (expensive and inefficient), building pumping stations near
a body of fresh water, or using Desalterizers.  Desalterizers are able to turn salty, poisonous ocean water into safe, pure Dihydrogen Monoxide
in a clean and efficient manner.  They're the key to this plan.

<br><br>

<b>STEP TWO: Melt the polar ice caps</b>.  This is going to happen anyway.  All we
have to do is wait.  As the ice caps start to melt, the Liberal god "Gaia" will try to
"punish humanity for not living in harmony with nature," but we'll have proven
ourselves smarter than some metaphysical slut.  We've got our Desalterizers, and as
the ocean starts to rise, we simply turn them on.

<br><br>

<b>OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVE STEP</b>.  Instead of relying on our Desalterizers
alone, we can instead build pipelines directly from the poles inland.  Since the ice caps
are already fresh water (salt falls out of suspension when water freezes), we can
simply pump water directly from the ice caps as they melt, before the newly-melted
water mixes with the salty ocean.

<br><br>

<b>STEP THREE:  What to do with the water</b>.  Remember when I mentioned
that a large portion of the Earth's surface is useless desert?  It doesn't take a Kreskin
to predict the water's future.  From our Desaltifiers and from our polar pipes, we
channel the water into rivers that flow through the dessert.  We build massive lakes in
previously barren areas, we build massive subteranian pumping systems, and we
engineer crosshatches of rivers that will result in <i>every single square meter of the
Earth's surface becoming arable land</i>.  Even already-arable land will benefit by
having a couple new rivers run through them: more water is good for agriculture, for
health, for sanitation, for industry, and for people.

<br><br>

<b>PROBLEMS SOLVED SO FAR:</b>

<br><br>

<li>Rising oceans.

<br><br>

<li>World hunger.

<br><br>

<li>Lack of access to drinking water.

<br><br>

<li>Uninhabitable areas of the world.

<br><br>

We may still have some melting polar caps left over once we do this, though.  Let's be
ambitious.  Let's do more.

<br><br>

<b>STEP FOUR: Electrolysis</b>.  Electrolysis is the process of separating water into
Molecular Oxygen and Molecular Hydrogen.  Electrolysis is very simple: you pass an
electrical current through water, and it separates into Oxygen and Hydrogen.  I'm sure
one of the "I'm a leet scientist dood" trolls will explain it in more detail in the
comments, so I won't comment on the process further here.

<br><br>

This will allow us to get rid of any water we have left over after step 3.  We'll be left
with huge supplies of pure Hydrogen and Oxygen.

<br><br>

<b>STEP FIVE: The new energy source</b>.  We have a bunch of new rivers.  This
next step is easy.  To quote the Gnomish parable:  "hydrodynamics!"

<br><br>

So that our new rivers will flow naturally rather than having to be pumped, which would
require more energy than it produced due to entropy, we will build giant mountains
with bowl-shaped tops.  The bowls will gather rain water, and water will flow from the
bowl/mountains into our rivers, downhill, where our dams will produce energy thanks to
our no-longer-misunderstood-friend, Gravity.

<br><br>

I can't sketch out exactly how this will be done, but we'll find some scientists to work
out the exact details.  Just trust me on the concept.

<br><br>

<b>STEP SIX:  What do so with the Hydrogen and Oxygen</b>.  Our Electrolysis
plants left us with massive quantities of Oxygen and Hydrogen.  Now we get to put it
to use.

<br><br>

The Oxygen is simple.  We release it into the air to replace the Oxygen lost to
deforestation.  That's what we'll do with some of it, at least: with the rest, we can
create more Ozone, and release that Ozone into the stratosphere to cool the world
back down to its original temperatures.

<br><br>

<b>STEP SEVEN: The future is today</b>.

<br><br>

Today's Science Fiction is tomorrow's Science Fact.

<br><br>

The <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671704273/qid=999407680/sr=2-2/ref=aps_sr_b_1_2/103-5622495-9666217">Star
Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual</a></i> tells us plenty of things we can
do with the Hydrogen.

<br><br>

If I could find my copy of the <i>Technical Manual</i>, I would provide direct quotes,
but I haven't seen it in years so I'll just have to go by memory.

<br><br>

<i>DEUTERIUM</i> - Deuterium is an isotope of Hydrogen.  In <i>Star Trek</i>,
Deuterium is the fuel source for the matter/antimatter reactor aboard the Enterprise,
which is responsible for not only warp travel, but for almost all power generation on the
ship.  We can turn our Hydrogen into Deuterium and start building Star Ships of our
own.

<br><br>

<i>ANTIMATTER</i> - The aforementioned matter/antimatter reactor, more
commonly called the Warp Engine, is powered by the mutual annihilation of matter
and antimatter, specifically Deuterium and Antideuterium.  The <i>Technical
Manual</i> describes how to turn matter into antimatter (there are schematics for a
device but nobody has built one yet), but it's somewhat inefficient: ten parts matter
transforms into one one part Antimatter.  That's okay, though, because at low warp
speeds, the Warp Intermix Ratio favors matter over antimatter.  It's only at Warp 8
that a 1:1 annihilation ratio is required.

<br><br>

On <i>Star Trek</i>, Dilithium Crystals are required in order to contain the
matter/antimatter reactions.  I won't go into how this works exactly because it's very
complex and I don't remember it.  In real life, we may not need anything like Dilithium
at all: human ingenuity will find a way.

<br><br>

<i>WARP TRAVEL</i> - Superluminal travel in <i>Star Trek</i> is dependant on the
existance of Subspace.  We don't know if Subspace exists in the real world, but many
scientists have their own pet theories on how superluminal travel could be achieved,
and if none of them work, we'll think of something else.  We'll certainly have the
energy required to move very, very fast thanks to our matter/antimatter drives.

<br><br>

<i>MATTER REPLICATION</i> - The <i>Technical Manual</i> also has
specifications for a matter replicator that can be used to create anything from a bottle
of liquor to a weapon of mass destruction.  What does it create this stuff out of?  You
guessed it:  <i>Hydrogen</i>

<br><br>

<b>PROBLEMS SOLVED SO FAR:</b>

<br><br>

<li>Rising oceans.

<br><br>

<li>World hunger.

<br><br>

<li>Lack of access to drinking water.

<br><br>

<li>Uninhabitable areas of the world.

<br><br>

<li>Limited energy supply.

<br><br>

<li>Temperature issues.

<br><br>

<li>Dwindling oxygen supply.

<br><br>

<li>Fuel required for high-tech goodies.

<br><br>

All <b>solved</b>!  I think we've about covered everything!

<br><br>

<b>STEP EIGHT: Interplanatary Exploration</b>. The moon, the asteroid belt, and
other extraterrestrial bodies, there's a lifetime supply of ever element, rock, metal, or
mineral that we could possibly need to survive.  There's even water, although I think
we have enough of that for now.  Once we start mining the asteroid belts, there
literally <b>nothing</b> that can stop us or threaten our survival.  Our galactic
expansion will become exponential after that, as we eventually colonize the entire
universe.

<br><br>

What we do once the entire Universe is colonized is left as an exercise to the reader.

<br><br>

<b>PART 3: CLOSING REMARKS</b>

<br><br>

Simple, yet elegant.

<br><br>

The next time you see a Liberal crying "We're hurting Mother Gaia so we should all live
in caves and eat nothing but berries and grass, and we should blow up all our cities
and industry because civilization hurts Gaia," punch her in the face and show her this
document.

<br><br>

I'm always open to feedback that'll help me expand and improve my plan.  If you have
<b>constructive</b> feedback, please post it as a comment.  The Adequacy editors
did a very good job yesterday of deleting most of the trolls from Part 1, so if you're
just planning on trolling, you can expect the same to happen to you.  I expect I've
placated all the serious naysayers, but I'm always open to critique.

A little more than a century? 125 years more than a century to be precise. 225 years is more than plenty for a proper heritage. Especially for a country that has dominated the world for most of its existence.

If oxygen was explosive, then there would be an explosion every time someone struck a match or lit a cigarette. Since "explosion" is just another name given to rapid oxidation, the very idea of oygen being oxidised is ridiculous. If oxygen could be oxidised, it would inevitably produce ozone (03 AKA oxygen oxide), which is nothing more than an absurd invention of the anti-capitalist environmental lobby. The existence of ozone as never been proven, since it is nothing more than an liberal myth!<BR><BR>
And any chemistry graduate will tell you that you cannot separate water into its constituent elements with an electric current. It is common knowledge that water is an electrical insulator, so any attempts to pass a current through it will be futile. "Electrolysis" of water simply results in a dielectric polarisation of water molecules. Any stories you hear about people being electrocuted by pouring water into electrical equipment are simply urban myths. There is no evidence to suggest than any of these "accidents" have ever occured.

Guess what? I'm still alive and NOT in the hospital. You see, what happened is all that non-conductive water stopped the release of elctrons that would normally brown my Eggo Waffle&#153;. The insulating powers of the water was in fact so powerful that it caused the electricity to back up the line with enough pressure to pop the switch on the outlet from 'On' to 'Off'.
<BR><BR>
In case you don't know, that's why we use those types of outlets around water. They function as release valves. If they weren't there and the hair dryer went into the toilet accidentally, the back-pressure could cause a rupture in the cord which would then leak valuable electrons all over the bathroom like an old garden hose.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Oxygen, in and of itself, is not explosive.  However, oxidation--which refers to most combustive processes--does require oxygen.   In this case, the actual reaction is:<BR>
<BR>
2 H2 + O2  --&gt; 2 H20<BR>
<BR>
This is, in fact, a highly explosive reaction.  As someone who has done numerous chemistry demonstrations at high schools, I can attest to the following:<BR>
<BR>
1)  A balloon of pure oxygen gas will not explode if popped with a candle flame.<BR>
2)  A balloon of pure hydrogen gas will explode, with a fireball sort of effect.  It's hot  but it's also slow--this is because it grows at the rate of oxygen in the atmosphere.<BR>
3)  A balloon of mixed hydrogen and oxygen will explode with an incredible noise.<BR>
<BR>
The space shuttle, in fact, already carries liquid hydrogen and oxygen.  So, while this is a viable solution it is ALREADY IN PLACE.  So the comment in the above post is wrong, because the poster was referring to the oxidation of hydrogen gas.<BR>
<BR>
The right comment is that water does not carry a current.  Yes, this is true.  However, let me add that once you add ions to water, all bets are off.  Water with a soluble acid or salt added to it can in fact be incredibly conductive.  Tap water has ions added to it, so in fact it's possible for people to be electrocuted by appliances.  <BR>

In fact, I did do the math.<BR>
<BR>
If the United States eliminates welfare, Social Security, medicare, medicaid, food stamps, donations to foreign countries, and other Unconstitutional and illegal socialist programs, my calculations show that raising the money would take about 8 years and constructing all of the neccessary infrastructure would take up to 20.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, we don't have to have all the infrastructure ready at once.    The oceans will rise slowly at first, so we can start small and "ramp up" as the small causes the economy to skyrocket.<BR>
<BR>
Labour is not a problem.  Remember all those third-world people who need fresh water?  There's probably about a billion of them.  There's our labour.  Using people instead of machines for labour will save a ton of money; these people are already used to working for no money and very little food so upkeep will be quite cheap.<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I have done some calculations to prove this. It is estimated that sea levels will rise, say, 10 metres because of global warming. Now, the equation for the volume of a sphere is (4/3)&pi;rE3 (r cubed, the radius). The (Equatorial) radius of the Earth is 6378136 metres (according to <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/phys_props_earth.html">the Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>).<BR><BR>
Now, clearly if the sea level rises 3 metres due to global warming, the equatorial radius will become 637813<b>9</b> metres. How much extra volume is this? Lets calculate:<BR><BR>
V=[(4/3)x&pi;x(6378139)E3 - (4/3)x&pi;x(6378136)E3] x 0.70<BR><BR>
(I put the 0.70 there because only 70% of the Earth is covered by water, not all of it)<BR><BR>
This little equation give us this: V=326056778217564453648.01801310617 cubic metres! This is the 'extra' water that the desalterisers will have to get rid of. (btw, a cubic metre of water is 1000 litres, or 2200 pints or so.)<BR><BR>
We can see that the desalterizers can easily eat up this volume of water. If the US, the only nation in the world prepared to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to the environment, builds 1000 desalterisers, and if the 'extra water' above is produced by global warming over the next 100 years, we can see that each desalterizer need only get rid of 326056778217564453 litres of water per year, a perfectly feasible task. The average american gets rid of 100 litres of water per day. If we up this a bit and pipe all the desalterised water to deserts and whatnot, we can create a veritible garden of Eden whilst getting rid of all this pesky extra water.<BR><BR>
<b>Other Bonuses:</b><BR><BR>
Because we will be redusing the mass of the earth by drinking all this extra water and thus making it disappear, the Earth will start to spin a little bit faster (because its Angular Momentum will decrease but the overall kinetic energy will remain the same). And because the mass of the earth will have decreased by 1% or something, whilst the earth is still travelling at the same speed, the Earth should, in all probability, drift out a little bit from the sun, cooling things down a little bit and helping to alleviate global warming.<BR><BR>
I for one congratulate Craig for producing a workable solution to the Global Warming Crisis.<BR><BR><BR>&hearts;, bc.<BR></FONT></td>

As an evangelical Christian, I know a lot of people who've done missionary work in India and other places like it.  I've done some short-term missionary stuff but not out of the country.  I want to go overseas someday, though.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, India is in a very interesting location with regards to Evangelism.  India is located in what's known as the "10-40 window."  The "10-40 window" is home to over 90% of the world's non-Christians, contains the home bases of all the world's major non-Christian religions, and there's a bunch of other interesting stuff about it but I don't remember them all.<BR><br><br>--

Melting of the polar ice caps has caused a rise in sea levels, which has resulted in countries (which are less dense than water) floating up into the northern hemisphere.

India has definitely been subject to some continental drift of late.  Although it's classified as a "subcontinent" of Asia now, it used to be its very own free-floating continent.  I'm not sure when the collission with Asia took place, but things on a geological scale happen very slowly, so it has probably been at least a few decades.<BR>
<BR>
I had a few people from India at my High School.  They'd get very mad whenever someone called them "Asia", retorting "We're not Asians, we're SUB-CONTINENTALS."   I imagine the people of India are struggling to maintain their identity now that their country has slammed into Asia and is slowly being integrated into it.<BR>

Also back in High School, I once told a pen pall in another state that there were several Indians at the school, and he immediately replied, "You politically insensitive JERK, they're supposed to be called NATIVE AMERICANS."<BR>

Would be adequacy authors should learn that proper satire and parody are literary genres with their own rather well understood rhetorical devices. Surely I am not the only one who has read the second book of Aristotle's Poetics?
In order to 
demonstrate absurdity in a real life position, one must imply  a  discrepancy between what is said and what is actually meant or practiced.   Feigning obtuse stupidity or inventing inane situations (or technologies, for that matter) that nobody can relate to is just sit-com crap.

People who are insecure with their own beliefs, upon seeing any opinion that differs significantly from their own, will immediately say "this must be a joke," or "this must be a troll," or "this is obvious satire."  What the short-sighted hypocrites don't realize is that with 6.1 billion people in the world, there exists a WIDE range of opinions and a WIDE specturm of views, and yes, people actually exist outside of your in-bred white-trash trailor park, and they DON'T think they way that you do.<BR>
<BR>
Live with it.<BR>
<BR>
I suggest you read the mission statement for this site before you start making accusations of "satire."   Satire is generally considered a form of trolling, and trolling is not allowed on this site.  Therefore, anything posted on this site can not be satire because it would violate the "no trolling" rule.<BR>
<BR>
If you're so insecure that you attack the person delivering the message instead of the message itself, the future doesn't need you.  If you don't have anything constructive to say, log off and go watch TV because I think you're missing one of your 37 regular professional wrestling shows.<BR><br><br>--

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I last posted a long list of incorrect science in the previous article.  I'm not going to go through and rip out all the major scientific flaws in this one, but I will make a few points.<BR>
<BR>
1.  Craig, you can't, on the one hand, claim that I'm part of a "scientific elite" which is trying to restrict people's knowledge about science to maintain my power base while you are trying to make your science accessible to everyone, and then say, "Oh I was right about the strong nuclear force because of quantum gravity work". <BR>
<BR>
In fact, both points are wrong.  The scientists I know are exuberant about their work and will explain both easy and arcane points about what they do to anyone who asks.  They love what they're doing, and they'd love to help anyone understand what it is they do.<BR>
<BR>
As for the second point, I don't want you to accuse me of scientific elitism, but the fact is--you're wrong.  Quantum gravity work, in fact, tries to include gravity under quantum mechanics (as the name implies).  The effort to unify relativistic physics and quantum mechanics is very old.  It has not yet been successful.  On the other hand, it is well known that in the specific case of molecular oxygen, any relativistic effects which should be introduced to the Schrodinger equation are, for all intents and purposes, zero.  Furthermore, quantum mechanics and relativity still don't have anything to do with the strong nuclear force.<BR>
<BR>
The claim of scientific elitism, essentially, is an ad hominem attack which you have employed, to hide behind the fact that while you may have read a lot of pseudo-science on the subject, you have never conducted original research or experiments, at your own admission, you have never even run preliminary numbers to determine feasibility, nor have you any evidence your plan will work.  I don't mean to offend you, but it seems that some people honestly believe that they are so smart, they don't need to do the work to get up to speed.  Nobody is that smart.  So my advice to you is to start going deeper.  Really *learn* the material.  You have a brain on your shoulders, but you should recognize that many other people have, too.  This means that rather than making up your own stuff (recipe for disaster) you should first understand what others have said on the subject.  Why?  Because nothing substitutes for original research and experimentation.  Thought only goes so far;  nature, not our petty arguments, is the only arbiter of who is wrong and who is right.<BR>
<BR>
2.  You claim we can desalinize the water and use it to reduce deserts.  But it is not the lack of water going in which makes a place a desert.  As a matter of fact, if you're aware of the problem with deforestation, one of the major problems is this:  people cut down rain forest to produce arable land.  Without the major plant systems in place, the top soil is blown away.  What was previously rain forest soon becomes desert.  It's not water that makes a place barren.  It's soil quality.  <BR>
<BR>
Try this experiment at home.  Take a strip of sod and put it in a container with holes at the bottom.  Then pour a lot of water over it.  Water retained, yes?  Now put a bunch of sand in the same container.  Pour a lot of water over it.  In this case, the water will all run out of the container.  <BR>
<BR>
Deserts are deserts not because (or not only because) they don't have water.  They need top soil in order to support plants.  On the other hand, this is a vicious cycle, because top soil will blow away if it is not held in place by a root system;  its beneficial microorganisms will die if it is not shielded from the suns rays by plants.  Plants need soil, but soil needs plants.  A plan to reduce the number of deserts requires more than water inflow;  it requires water retention in water-poor areas.  This is a much more complicated problem than dumping water all over the place.<BR>
<BR>
Really, the major problem with global warming is not the ocean levels rising--it's the unpredictability of the climate changes which may ensue.  For instance, more hurricanes may ensue, and in areas which have up to this point, not experienced any.  What kind of damage would that do?  Well, the plant life could be stripped, the top soil in that area blown away, and entire swaths of arable land could be destroyed.  Some people laugh when they say that California could be underwater, but frankly, look at where your groceries come from.  California's central valley produces a lot of agricultural products.<BR>
<BR>
We don't know what will happen next.  It's a chaotic system, and one which we haven't yet adequately simulated (as a matter of fact, cannot adequately simulate!)  Nature moves with surprising speed.  Excuse the personification there;  I'm not some Gaia-worshipper, and I don't believe in mother earth.  I do believe in chaotic systems, and weather patterns were the prototypical chaotic system.<BR>
<BR>
My final comment is this:  I know many many people who are deeply involved in original research in atmospheric science, in combustion research, and electronic structure theory.  I know people who are biologists and climatologists who are trying to grapple with the incredibly complex issues, and to develop contingency plans for the most probably outcomes.  If you really care about this issue, try and join them.  You'll find that most scientists are ready and willing to discuss these issues in an intelligent and rigorous fashion, with anyone interested.  They'll tell you when you're wrong, and if you ask, give you lists of reading material to help you figure out what to do from there.  And maybe if you do, you can make a difference.<BR>
<BR>
Frankly, though, your current arrogance--that you believe that without doing a decent literature survey you can dictate a pristine solution to a complicated problem when you don't even understand the basics--won't do a darned thing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
 You automatically reject conclusions of people with religious fanatism, but i'm afraid that yourself aren't but a religious fanatic of a liberatorium credum whose mainly prophet is Ayn Rand.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't want to do this, but since you're talking in name of science, let's hear what science says:<BR>
<BR>
 From the system dynamics point-of-view, every system of enormous quantity of subsystems <BR>
tend towards chaos, that is, the whole system is unstable to small perturbations. There are dynamical systems that their equations are intrisically chaotic. Poincare discovered in 1904 that Navier-Stokes equations (those used to describe fluids, and, hey! hence the climate) where chaotic. <BR>
<BR>
But there's a question; If a system is inherently exponentially unstable (that means chaotic) how could arise such deeply stable climate phenomenons like hurricanes? (think for a while in the red spot of jupiter). This brought up the idea that while the vast majority of the time & space systems behave chaotically, there sometimes are ocurrences of matter that self-organize in big clusters around dynamical holes, called attractors. <BR>
<BR>
 In this point of view, a whirl is water around an atractor, a plant is also a whirl of carbonides molecules entering in the system through nourishment and leaving through leaves that fall. In fact, life can be understanded (which i think a must-goal) as a very complex set of auto-replicant atractors. You could add at this point that conciusness is the last step in attractor evolution, because this new attractors are mostly kinesthesical images which reproduce mainly through language some years ago, now with other more efficient ways, "media".<BR>
<BR>
People that has this big issue about religion let their belief take over his mind, unknowingly of becoming in that way believers of false. The mayor credo of the scientist is doubt, but then constant doubt make your knowledge grow only stronger, or in other words, "believe with unattachment will not take you where the truth is, but will put you in the way".<BR>
<BR>
At this point of my life, i dont care if a believer declares himself in words an rationalist atheist, i now only perceive the excitement in his stare.<BR>

Thats only true for the south pole, by the way. The north pole is a massive icecap floating on water and as such the force of its weight acting down on the water beneath it pushes up the sea level around the rest of the planet. Wether the H2O at the north pole is ice or water its mass is the same and as such its effect on sea levels is the same.
<BR><BR>Just a minor nitpick. Of course as the icecaps at the south pole are resting on land, not water, when they melt and flow into the ocean that will have a definate effect on sea levels.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I think that anyone who took this piece seriously should go hop on the Star Ships you talk about, the ones we can power with our new found fuel supply, and get away from this planet!<BR>

Great ranting here!  You should think about going on Letterman or Dennis Miller someday with this stuff!  Funny!  <BR>
