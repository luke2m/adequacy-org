		Hello gentle readers, and a   Merry Christmas to you all. I apologize for my absence; I have not forgotten you, but T. Reginald Gibbon's article on hackers apparently touched a few nerves, and in the ensuing DOS attacks, my meager 33.6 modem was unable to reliably access this site. So, belatedly I answer a readers question on an inlaw's fertility, and help a couple realize a fantasy.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Dear Adam,
<p>
It is the holiday season, and I get to see all my wonderful inlaws. I do worry about my wife's youngest sister, though. She has been married to her husband for five years, and has but two children. Would it be prying to ask if they have fertility problem? Do you suppose they might even be using birth control? They have such a beautiful house, it should be full of children. We will be visiting them this season, what do you think?
<p>
Wants lots of nieces and nephews
<p>
<br>
Dear Wants.
<p>
I don't recommend prying too much, perhaps they are having fertility problems, or have had miscarriages, it can be a painful subject. You can ask when they are going to get a baby sister/brother for little Esau, while dandling him on your knee. That being said, while it would be a sin to poke holes in any <a href="http://www.durex.com">Trojans</a> you find in their bedroom, it may be a greater sin to use them, capiche?
<p>
<p>
<br>
Dear Adam,
<p>
I read with interest your advice to <a href="./2001.11.21.62615.786.html#14"><i>bathe in walnut shells</i></a> in order to provide a fantasy to my wife of being ravished by a muscle bound blackmen. This may give my skin a dusky hue, but how to I acquire a huge, thick ebony rod of manhood? Could I buy the Big Brutha penis sheathe?<p>
Fearful of being Inadequate
<p>
<br>
Dear fearful,
<p>
There is a myth that men of African descent have much larger penii than men of European descent. Whether this is due to watching perverted pornographic films, subtle racism, or extrapolating athletic prowess to genital size, I do not know. Masters and Johnson did do a statistical measurement indicating a slight size difference, on the order of half an inch, but the sample size was almost too small to be valid. 
<p>
That being said, using a Big Brutha sheathe is almost certainly prohibited, unless you take the time to drill holes in it to prevent it from being used a birth control device. Even then, I would find it morally suspect.
<p>
The even greater moral question is whether you should be engaging in such miscegenation fantasies. It sounds perilously close to infidelity in the heart to me, while it may <a href="http:///www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/whoswho/stymie.jpg">stymie</a> your wife's odd urges in the short term, in the long term it may prove hazardous to your health. Couldn't you just read the Song of Solomon together?      <br><br></div>

<BR><BR>When you consider that the Earth is considered to be capable of supporting eleven billion humans and that the current population is over nine billion, the issue of birth control begins to take on a whole new outlook.  While procreation is a blessing, moderation is in order before we produce more children than we can feed.  Population growth needs to taper off rather than increase the way it has.  Your relatives may have decided that they're produced enough children and that it would be irresponsible (or possibly beyond their means) to create more.  Respect their decision and their maturity, and leave them alone.  It takes a mature adult to know when to stop.

</br>

<BR><BR>Dear Fearful:

<BR><BR>It sounds to me like your wife is hinting that you just aren't enough.  It could be your technique, your imagination or possibly just the equipment God provided you.  Whatever the reason, you should not be afraid to branch out into alternate forms of satisfaction for your wife.  If she wishes to sample "dark meat," there are plenty of organizations out there for you to find and meet people who fit the bill.

<BR><BR>However, you should be picky about whom you choose to play with.  Mere physical attraction is not always sufficient; you should be ready to ask for a medical background and insist on barrier method birth control.  You should also be comfortable around the man (or men) your wife will be shagging, and understand that while your wife may <strong>lust</strong> for them she <strong>loves</strong> you and will still be there with you when the lights go out.

<BR><BR>If you can't bring yourself to be selfless and thoughtful of your wife's needs in that way, there are tools and medical procedures designed to simulate the greater girth and length your wife obviously craves.  Shop around and find a solution you're both comfortable with; there may be several you can choose and alternate between for variety.  Involve your wife in every step of the process.  She knows what she wants from you, and she knows what will satisfy her best.  It will help you grow as a couple and give you new insights into what will make you a better lover for her.

Frankly, I think it is the Indians and slanteyes who should stop procreating.  They already have more than they can feed, besides which it wouldn't matter if they are sinning by doing so or not, because, as heathens, they are going to hell anyway.  Personally, I think we should take on a <i>forced</i> birth control program in that part of the world in order to keep them from eating themselves to death, but unfortunately, there are too many short-sighted people in this nation today who would resist such an expense. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Through labeling and using the term "liberalist" as an insult, which you do often, it can be deduced that you have little favor for those of the liberal mindset.

You should stop contradicting yourself, unless you enjoy being thought of as a below average intellectual force on this site.  Just a suggestion.

<br><br>
  As long as we're pointing out inclinations...<br>
<br>
  Isn't it the case with any philosophy, that some followers will degenerate it into a zombie-worshiping demon cult?  From my experiences, it seems that really anything can degenerate to a mindless cult, recycling the same rhetoric spew.<br>
<br>
  Especially philosphies based on Gods...<br>
  <br>
 <i> I'm not blowing hot air here; learn some world history to see for yourself how painfully true that statement is.</i><br>
<br>
  I think you are, insofar as we can exchange and debate historical lessons learned to support whatever arguments we're trying to push.<br>
<br>
  As long as we're trying to push "self-evident truths" regarding the pragmatic advantage of philosophies, lets compare the effectiveness of Critical Thinking (Science) with philosophies based on a God.  In otherwords, which has done more the improve the quality of life on this planet?  Which one would you rely on to save your life?  Which one dares to challenge itself?<br>
<br>
  Some of you may point out that Science is not a religion, it is just a method.  Well, Consider the purpose and impact of this method.<br>
<br>
Purpose - To sift truth from BS<br>
<br>
  There are many of you who believe that you can comfortably believe in God and Science simutaniously....  You can!!!  People are capable of a huge range of functions, including believing in a many philosophies simutaniously without resolving the conflicts between them!!!<br>
<br>
  However, If you want to get serious for a moment:  Science suggests there is no reason for believing in God.  If there was, Science would have given us a lot of proof, just like if phychics were real, a psychic would have proven it to us. (If you were psychic, wouldn't you take the James Randi test, win the $1 million, and prove to that fag, once and for all that you should never doubt master psychics like Silvia Brown?) <br>
<br>
  That's not saying the idea of God existing is impossible, it just suggests that if he does exist, not sharing his perfect goodness with us is cruel, which would not make him perfectly good.<br>
<br>
  ...but you can explain that, can't you?<br>
<br>
<br>Oh yeah, What were we talking about?  You were saying that history teaches us that God is the cornerstone of every great civilization.  How does Science rank up?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Because if one <i>were</i> to second-guess the xian god's intentions, one might see the inconsistencies of an omniscient, omnipresent and omnibenevolent god allowing so many of his creations to be killed by famine or war, disease or murder... or for some of those who die to spend an eternity suffering in "hell" merely for not believing in the "right" god, while those who murder and rape can spend eternity in "heaven" if they accept Christ into their lives and repent for their sins.

<BR><BR>The obvious questions, then, are: wouldn't it have been simpler for the xian god to have just selected those he wished to be in "heaven" and those that would end up in "hell" and cut out the middle man of <i>life on Earth</i> and put everyone in their respective places, as, according to xian doctrine, that's where all humans will end up when it's all said an done?  Why does an all-powerful god need to be worshipped, then, if said god decided to have humans live out life on Earth before they move on to some form of afterlife?  And if god is all-powerful, why would the existence of evil or "satan" be challenging enough to affect god's Earthly creations, including humankind?

<BR><BR>But these are just questions, of course.  "Why does the Bible dissuade readers from questioning the will or existence of god?" is another.  "Eternity in `hell' as a punishment for such questioning of this god" is the Bible's answer... or threat, depending on how it's viewed. 

<BR><BR>Personally, any of "god's perfect goodness" would be much more enjoyable without some of the perfectly horrible things that exist in this world.  In this light the xian god could be considered to be very cruel indeed, making his human subjects suffer through the travails of life without any divine assistance other than the notion of an afterlife in paradise for those who maintain their faith.<BR><BR><BR>Your denial is beneath you, and thanks to the use of hallucinogenic drugs, I see through you.  <i>Bill Hicks</i><BR></FONT></td>

And it isn't just 'xians' who believe in this, by the way - I'm not and never have been an 'xian', though I'm beginning to think there's quite a bit of sense there. I'm also starting to agree with Nathan that your abbreviation is a bit annoying. Should I start calling you an a-ist? No, I'm just kidding, but it is a question of respect. I don't claim to know much about religion at all, but I do know that my concept of God is quite different from the one you describe. One of these days I might even be able to articulate what that concept is.<BR>

And if god is omniscient, which the Bible claims that he is, wouldn't he be aware of all of the acts of humankind <i>long before</i> they occur?  I assume this also includes that god is aware of human destiny, including the destination of humans after they die... meaning that "free will" has already been preordained by god despite humankind's attempts to strike out our own path.  Which is quite depressing if you think about it.

<BR><BR>I've stopped saying "xian" as my purpose is not to offend, and the term xian is obviously offensive to some.  My apologies if I have.  I may be an atheist, but I'm not an insensitive bitch... not always, anyway. ;)  But I agree-- respect is important, and I would be a hypocrite if I offended others while wishing that others would respect my own ideals.

<BR><BR>My concept of heaven and hell is obviously engrained in the Christian perception of such, as I was raised Baptist by a Baptist minister (who, ironically, is the greatest supporter of my atheist decision).  For many years I <i>too</i> had my own concept of god, as the concepts that were shown to me were quite unbelievable.  We are all comfortable with what we know subjectively, and if you have a concept that works for you-- kudos.  And I don't mean that sarcastically.  I have all kinds of respect for those who <i>honestly know</i> what they believe, and are comfortable with that belief, whether or not they are able to articulate the belief and whether or not it is a belief with which I agree.

I'm still trying to articulate, at least to myself if no one else, why God is all-good and all-powerful and yet bad things happen. As far as I know, it's been a thorny theological question for years. My only current thought on this is that even if God *knows* everything and can do everything, it doesn't mean God *acts* to intervene all the time. <BR>
<BR>
As for free will and predestination, I like the analogy my friend gave me yesterday. You're in love with someone and you want them to love you, but would you rather make them love you or that they fell in love with you of their own accord? That's about as far as I've gotten with that thus far.<BR>

You'll enjoy Lewis if you've read L'Engle, but I think you meant that Lewis was L'Engle's mentor...? (since he's been dead since 1963 and she's still around or recently deceased)<BR>

"A Wrinkle in Time" is still one of my favorite children's books, much for that reason.  And of course, Lewis' 'Chronicles of Narnia' series is fascinating in its parallel between religion and Arthurian mythology.

<BR><BR>"Thorny theological questions", including that of "free will", are fun. It seems that you're quite an intelligent person-- continue looking for your own answers, as it seems you already are.  While I see nothing but glaring contradiction when I delve into these problems, you might see something completely different and equally interesting.  That's what I find most fascinating about our species-- Two people, biologically equivalent.  Two minds, wildly varying.

<BR><BR>But as far as your stumbling block, if I might relate with a personal experience-- it is difficult to perceive a god who is capable of metaphorically "turning his/her back" on human suffering if one has been ingrained with the image of or is innately hopeful for an "all-loving" god.  It's almost like the moment children realize their parents are fallible-- suddenly the almost "god-like" image we have of our parents is held up against the not-so-perfect, but inherently <i>human</i>, image of a mother or father who has failed in some way.  That can be difficult to process, especially in young children.  So then the image of an all-loving god, and one who allows his human "children" to make mistakes and ultimately suffer, is an interesting one... especially considering how many other human qualities mankind has instilled upon our god figures throughout history.  And how humans respond to this theoretical "parenting" is also interesting, as is seen in those "thorny" questions and the resulting debates. ;)

<BR><BR>Again, just my personal input, and I appreciate yours.  And thanks for being one of the <i>very</i> few non-judgmental and decent people I've met on this site to date.

His reply to the AR seemed merely to be an emotional response to an issue he would rather not have handled, when instead he could throw the liberal vs. conservative argument into the air as a diversion tactic.  The AR made quite a good point, yet tkatchev chose to evade the point... as he is given.

<BR><BR><i>You've made it clear that this is what "conservative" means to you.</i>

<BR><BR>You have an issue with giving credence to your claims, but I will forgive you as it appears this is only a <i>personal opinion</i> of what you believe I do or do not think.  Conservativism transcends politics, and has less to do with Republican or Democrat than it does to do with personal views and opinions on any number of topics.

<BR><BR>I am pleased to hear that, politically at least, you and I have much in common.  I also deplore much of what the American Republican Party supports and has carried out through history.  Likewise, I also deplore much of what the American Democratic Party has supported and carried out through history.  Hopefully you do not prejudge ones political opinions based on their personal, <i>liberal</i> views.

<BR><BR>Which is why we're here-- discussing these topics may, hopefully, lead to better understanding on both parts and, eventually, common ground on which to stand.

<BR><BR>Considering tkatchev's continuing responses, he has asserted that he is fundamentally xian, pro-life, anti-birth control, and socially conservative.  Based on these responses, I deduced that he <i>is</i> conservative, and that his responses are of a conservative nature.  And, as I originally stated, it made no sense for him to claim that he wasn't defending the "so-called" conservative viewpoint because he was, and is, whether it be "American" conservativism or not.  My issue is not with the conservative viewpoint-- but with the <i>contradiction</i>.  My issue was also with the statement:

<BR><BR><i>in fact, in the U.S. a "conservative" is simply an outmoded liberalist.</i>

<BR><BR>which I do not <i>agree</i> is a fact, as is my right.

I won't tell you what to say and how to say it, if you'll afford me the same rights, deal?  Honestly, are you <i>so</i> conservative that you would try to control the way I express myself?  At least, in <i>this</i> country, the good ol' US of A, I have the right to express myself freely.  Where do you live?

Are you going to tell us how you would go about setting up forced birth control in a foreign country?<BR>
havent china already got an efficient forced birth control program underway?<BR>

Anyway its western countries which are using up far more resources than anyone else even though we have far less people and a lower population growth.<BR>

Actual birth control will be far too difficult to effectively promote in a country like India. Thankfully we have an alternative plan that is already well underway.
<BR><BR>
Our behind-closed-doors negotiations with Pakistan have been proceeding nicely, and it should only be a matter of weeks before you will see a couple well-placed thermonuclear devices detonated over the cities of Calcutta and Mumbai.

You see the European Union (EU) is planning the same course of action against the US. The newly forming superstate percieves the US as its biggest threat - that once it fully combines to the peak of its power, that the US will percieve it as an adversary and a threat and eventually become hostile to the new competition as it did to the soviet union. The signs are already showing.<BR>
<BR>
You see the EU isnt truely democratic. Yes, there are democratic figureheads - politicians from each country for example which make up the public democratic view of the EU that everyone sees on TV, but these people are only in it for their own countries and fight and bicker and such like to get their own way. <BR>
Then there are the real controllers. There is no 'inner circle' as such but an assortment of secretive, power hungry people, unaccountable to the people of Europe but they work together in order unlike their counterparts. These are the people who make up and reinforce plans for European Armies and European Currencies even when the people generally oppose them - these are the masters of propaganda and planning. These are the people that have the power to make things happen in Europe.<BR>
<BR>
The european supported attack against the WTC didnt topple the US economy and government as was expected. Yes it was supported by the EU in secret - notice how quite a lot of the terrorists linked back to major Al-Quaeda cells in western europe? Not a coincidence. Of course the EU easily brushed this off as all EU countries went into an arrest terrorist frenzy, betraying their acomplices and pretending they were on the US side. All leading Al-Quaeda members who knew were executed (and not many knew) to keep it secret. <BR>
Bin Laden has also betrayed his followers and is under the protection of the EU, probably hidden in some European country. But whats in it for the EU by keeping Bin Laden alive? You see while he lives, the US will always believe that Al-Quaeda still lives. This provides excellent cover for any covert terrorist operations the EU might want to perform in the future and also allows them to utilise Bin Ladens links with the middle east.<BR>
Who do you think planted that video tape that pretended he was in Afghanistan still? And all the information implying that he was first camped in Tora Bora and now he's crossed the border into pakistan? its all misguiding lies.<BR>
Bin laden had weeks to escape Afghanistan before the US 'sealed' it off. You really think he didnt leave while he had the chance? Noone ever suspects he's hiding in Western Europe though.<BR>
The master plan of the EU Controllers is for nothing short of world domination - or world supremacy. To do this they will attempt to bring about the fall of the US by covert means and leave the EU to control the world.<BR>
<BR>
Only WE can stop this!! yes the 2 of us! we must start nowwwwwwww!<BR>

Instead of birth control we should have as many male children as possible.

Indeed you must di something to stop this madness. Its in their best ineterst since there is no excuse for using birth control (especially in front of our Beloved Father the Ultimate Judge).

You've got it all backwards!

While it is the obligation of us all to 'be fruitful and multiply', family relations tend to suffer if tact is tossed out the window. As for destroying any contraceptive devices they may have, I would highly recommend it. Much like the retribution dealt to those involved with the abortion trade, it is sometimes necessary to take extreme steps to ensure that our society doesn't crumble under the weight of Godless heathens who seem to delight in destroying everything He has created.<BR><BR>
I cannot lavish as much praise on the advice provided to Fearful. This man needs to pull his wife aside and push her nose into the bible. It is quite clear the God expects wives to be subservient to their husbands, not expecting them to impersonate some wicked fantasy their wives dreamed up from watching re-runs of Shaka Zulu. He should simply tell his wife that she must rid herself of these insane fantasies and make due with whatever 'equipment' is available within the marriage. He should keep her away from any corrupting influences for a reasonable period of time (maybe lock her in the root cellar), then test her to see whether she has rid herself of her extramarital desires. If not, I am sure that his church could help to push her in the right direction, if not cure her weakness of faith permanently.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The only viable world view, in our enlightened scientific age, is monistic materialism.  (Proof: Occam's Razor.)  Consequently, the material world may be considered as a post-Einsteinian update of the Newtonian clockwork universe.  The brain, which is made of matter (proof: the universe is monistic,) is subject to the same natural laws as all other objects and entities.  Therefore, the "mind" (ie, the feedback-system epiphenomenon manifesting from the nervous system) is a manifestation of purely material phenomena.<BR><BR>Therefore, what we call "free will" is better regarded as a manifestation of the behaviouristically trained nervous system.  It is called free in order that it may be efficiently and productively conditioned in order to fulfill its destiny as a successful biological automaton within a world of such (most of inferior sophistication.)  Were it not called free, proper conditioning of the socializing instincts would be discordant with its own self-perception - but it is no more free than the tides are free to defy the moon or a raindrop is free not to fall to the earth.  In fact, there is no meaning to "human being" except as a socialized creature, of specific biology, predicted to fall within certain norms and tolerances.  In fact, a monistically materialistic world could contain nothing else.<BR><BR>I suggest you take up this rather hard cheese with Aristotle, old boy.  It's getting beyond my competence.  Materialism as an apology for communism is left as an exercise for the reader.<BR><BR>Nathan<BR>--<br><b>Li'l Sis:</b> Yo, that's a real grey area.  Even by my lax standards.<BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I agree that if humans are viewed as they truly are, a higher-order animal, it is easy to see that we carry out the same instinctual behaviors found in our lesser animal counterparts (evolution of the brain has given humans the personality and behavior traits necessary to carry out these instinctive impulses in a way that defines our society).

<BR><BR>So if monistic materialism is the answer, shouldn't most other human socialization instincts <i>also</i> be called into question along with the invention of "free will", including law, justice, morality, social order, marital monogamy... belief in a supreme spiritual being who created and controls the universe?

<BR><BR>But if these things <i>aren't</i> subject to the same laws of all other objects and entities, how can they exist in a monistically materialistic universe?  And what, then, would be the role of the human "will" (not free), or wouldn't it fall into the category of human instinct-- an invention of the human mind, a manifestation of the physical brain, to give life purpose or meaning?
