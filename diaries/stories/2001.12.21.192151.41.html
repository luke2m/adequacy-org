I've seen a couple of these chics, repulsive, narcissistic, self-deluded about their appearance, successfuly flirt their way up and deliberately hurt other people because they want their territory, or kill the opposition and put a future employee in the empty spot. <br><br>
Guys do it to, as well.  I've seen supposedly straight guys grossly "kiss it", and try to get over on their peers.  What's gross is seeing the boss "like" it.  What's crazy, is why the cattiness if the guy is already making twice as much and in a more secure position.<br><br>

She understands why I do not wish her to use these hacking tools such as the so-called "Quake" training program.  I was not aware, however, that asking for so called "video cards" was a problem.  I had a talk with her the other day when she asked about upgrading the computers "memory", and I got upset that she might be turning into a hacker.<BR><BR><BR>--

ok,<BR>
i dont know where to begin.<BR>
umm, you said this "quake where hackers go and train" something along that line. well just so you know, ITS A GAME FUCK HEAED!. And "i let my daughter use aol" uhh.. news flash aol isn't the only thing out there. also "my daughter asked to upgrade ram, she might be a hacker" well news flash, ram makes the computer faster, the world is turning into an impatient place and everyone wants to have faster computers. Now i dont know the first thing about hacking, but i am quite the computer geek. and i always upgrade my computer, hmm maybe i should get sent to prision. and by upgrading your video card, HOW IN THE HOLY HELL DOES THAT MAKE YOU A HACKER. i suggest you do a lil research before making an argument you can't back up! I know both sides of the story, i used to be ignorant about computers. NO WHERE NEAR AS BAD AS YOU, i was at least open minded about the topic. hell if that fuck up mr gibbons told you that a monitor was the gateway to hell, you'd probubly throw it out the window and tell your daughter never to that side of the house again! your a narrow minded ignorant piece of shit! Until you Know every side of the story you have no argument going for you!<BR>
<BR>
www.planetquake.com go there, NO YOU WONT GO TO JAIL OR HELL FOR LOOKING AT THE SITE<BR>
its the quake "hacker union to you" game. also quake has absolutly nothing to do with the internet if you dont want it to be. You can play it off line. its actually a fun game try it some time, then you can argue with some realy facts behind your story.<BR>
And, the fuck head gibbons said lots of things that have no relavance to being a hacker. but one that truck me was the whole telnet thing. bad news pal. you have telnet on your computer now! ut oh. ur guna go to jail ut oh ut oh. i'm guna call the police on you and your daughter. ut oh. <BR>
<BR>
God your dumb. And the fuck head said something along the lines of. "hackers use telnet to connect to other computers without using a telephone line" hmmmmm like i said dumb fuck, how can you connect to a computer using telnet with a fucking telephone line WHAT THE SHIT... did telnet turn to telepathic net over night i dont think so, captain obvious!<BR>
<BR>
but what i can do to provide evidence for both sides, i'll list some info to really know if your kids a "computer hacker"<BR>
<BR>
first let me explain the word hacker (my definitoni): a person who obtains information without the victem knowing. ie: me breaking into your computer with out your permission<BR>
<BR>
what a hacker is not: a person who downloads programs, plays games, upgrades computer, plays/chats/whatever for hours at a time<BR>
<BR>
1. a shell account. if your kid has a shell account theres a pretty good chance that he's a hacker. Shell accounts are used to get a way to connect to computers by going through another source without being traced back to you<BR>
<BR>
2. Linux is a possibility that your a hacker, but still is a fucking operating system. i know ppl that have them in there car! good god maybe there a "mobile hacker" one of those ya know! dumb ass<BR>
<BR>
3. D.O.S. attacks (Denial Of Service i believe thats what it means). Those are also posibilities but still i doubt it!!!!<BR>
<BR>
4. ping program. also you have that on your computer too, ut oh ur guna go to hell... but no ping does shit... all it does is ping an ip, it sends a packet from your ip to theres and measures the time for it to go there and back, and the faster the connections the lower the time<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Theres really no way to know. Seriously i wouldn't be to worried about it if your daughter was. and if you dont even let her on the computer ( YA KNOW THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD) then she prolly wont know the first thing to do. so i'd stop denying your daughter the legacy of using a comptuer, the future of her life, because your affraid of her being a hacker.<BR>
<BR>
downloading programs, upgrading your computer, using a different operating syste, playing on the computer for long periods of time, and playing games. DOES NOT MAKE YOU A HACKER<BR>
<BR>
and that net nanny crap is also a load of shit. if you kid is in fact a hacker i can 150% guarantee you he/she knows how to get if off of the computer. i'm not a hacker and i knwo how to do that shit!<BR>
<BR>
oh one more thing i rememberd. dip shit said "my son put linux (or something) on my computer and i had to return the computer to the manufacturer and they had to put a new hard drive on it"<BR>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH no you dont<BR>
its as simple as<BR>
<BR>
start<BR>
shutdown<BR>
restart in msdos mode<BR>
c:<BR>
format c:<BR>
y<BR>
<BR>
booya<BR>
doo that and you'll be set, no more nothing<BR>
<BR>
plain and simple mr gibbons is a dumb fuck<BR>
and should be shot many many times in the dick! and a few other choice places<BR>I hate mr gibbons,and any other ignorant f*ck up parents out there.<BR></FONT></td>

People such as the colombine situation, just use those as excuses. I just say, it was texas! lol, damn republicans and their guns!

<BR><BR>
But I disagree with this label.  Quake is not a game.  Quake is a training ground for killers.  The only conceivable purpose that one would play Quake is to learn how to kill: it is, for all intents and purposes, a murder simulator.
<BR><BR>
An interesting corrolary:  While browsing through the Hacker site <a href="http://www.Slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a> I found many articles on Quake.  The <a href="http://www.Slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> hackers seem quite taken with Quake!  I wonder why... could it be that they have a deep hatred of the world? Obviously, the urge to murder is not natural, but it seems prevalent in the Hacker community.
<BR><BR>
In order to prevent another Columbine, we ought to ban Quake.  A better step, however, would be to ban Quake and Hacking.  That way, we get rid of the tools hackers train with and make the malicious hacking process illegal.

<BR>
When I entered medical school, I realized something quite shocking.  A larger than normal percentage of the people in my class were attractive.  Some of them were downright HOT.  Of course, there are a few ugly people, but not a number representative of the general population of 22-28 year olds.<BR>
<BR>
Several other people in my class noticed it.  It got me thinking about good-looking kids getting more attention in class, getting more oportunities in the professional world, and doing better on interviews.<BR>
<BR>
Well, there's my anecdotal evidence (as if any more is needed).  The good looking rise to the top.<BR>_<br>
