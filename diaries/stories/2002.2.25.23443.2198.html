		If the war on terrorism has demonstrated anything it's the effectiveness of preemptively arresting and incarcerating undesirables who fit a certain terrorist profile.  Some have denounced this action as "racial profiling", which we are told is invidious under the Constitution, and maybe they have a point; perhaps <em>racial</em> profiling does more harm than good.<p>

But we must remember that not all types of profiling are equally bad.  Some types produce benefits that far outweigh their costs.  Indeed, certain types of profiling are so selective in targeting only a truly odious and uniformly guilty category of persons that they can truly be deemed just and appropriate. <p>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Enron; Global Crossing; General Electric; Monsanto.  What do these corporations have in common besides rampant political and economic scandals? They are led in their wicked crimes against humanity by rich white men.  Electoral fraud; political corruption; violence; intimidation.  These are only some of the pestilences rich white men perpetrate upon our society.  It's enough to keep an ordinary citizen awake at night. <p>

With their clamoring for corporate welfare, rich white men suck our society dry.  With fraudulent accounting and widespread tax shelters, they refuse to give back their due share to the nation that fosters their livelihoods.  Though the fairy tales depict Robin Hoods righting the cosmic balance by stealing from the rich and giving back to the poor, the truth is that the poor remain merely pawns in the well-moneyed gambits of rich white men.<p>

Our surest security lies in the core values of civilization, values that rich white men oppose.  When confronted with the awe-inspiring breath-taking beauty of America's pristine wildernesses, ordinary Americans feel a renewed appreciation of our world and of their faith.  Rich white men, however, only see profits and spoils.  Where an ordinary American sees a baby calf suckling at its mother's teat, a rich white man sees veal; where an ordinary American sees an elderly patient slowly dying of cancer, a rich white man sees a missed opportunity for eugenics.<p>

At times, the behavior of rich white men is simply dumbfounding.  We ask ourselves: "How could they believe what they do?  How can they live with themselves?"  Some call them mad, mad with a thirst for wealth and power that devours everything in its path.  Others look to psychological roots, a Napoleonic complex perhaps, that can explain their megalomania and accompanying virulent misanthropy.  But whatever the cause, this much is clear: rich white men pose a threat to the very existence of our nation as we know it, and they must be reined in. <p>

The war against rich white men cannot be an easy one for the simple reason that they do not bear a single national face or even speak a common language.  Divided into corporate cells of tightly knit "corporate directors", they hold closed-door meetings in anonymous skyscrapers and secretly congregate on the very floors of our securities-trading markets.  Though some foreign nations are especially notorious for harboring rich white men and their rich white enterprises -- the Cayman Islands come readily to mind -- we cannot satisfy ourselves with lashing out militarily at such politically isolated sparsely populated lands.  We cannot completely turn our attention abroad while domestic rich white men hatch diabolical schemes to rape our pension plans and natural environment at home.<p>

So how can we hope to fight a war against such people in such a world? How can we penetrate such small groups who live in such remote places? The only people who can penetrate these shadowy groups and deter them are their own societies, and it has so far proven impossible to recruit turncoat rich white men to this cause.  No, the ordinary clandestine methods are of no use to us here.  What is required is a stronger and more overt response. <p>

What I propose is very simple: we must round rich white men up and segregate them from society so they can do no harm.  Drawing on our historical success with Japanese internment camps, I propose establishing so-called "country clubs" where rich white men will be permitted a modicum of freedom to live their lives among themselves according to their kind but forbidden from wreaking their havoc on the outside world.  The job of deporting rich white men to these clubs will be all the easier for their racial homogeneity; rich white men thrive on the opportunity to exclude other races from their private affairs. <p>

Only by taking initiative and preemptively striking at the rich white scourge within our borders can we loosen their grasp on our the throat of our nation.  The road will not be easy and we shall encounter fierce resistance: rich white men maintain a standing army of blacks, Latinos, and poor white men to do their fighting for them.  But if we do not rise to the occasion and smite this menace according to our manifest destiny, then our children will never know a world of liberty and prosperity. <p>

Let's make the world a safer place.      <br><br></div>

I wish I still had the paper I wrote, it went into how the rich wind up paying less than everyone else in taxes in the US.  <br><br>
I don't remember the exact numbers, but I ran some calculations to see what would happen if the tax laws were revamped by myself.  The moral of the story was that if we put an income limit of $1 million a year per person, and just flat out taxed the rest of it off, nobody else would ever have to pay taxes.  <br><br>
If you're unfamiliar with US tax laws, people at the low end of todays Adequate Poll, such as myself,  would be paying about 33% of their income in taxes.   People at the middle to higher end should theoretically pay a similar percentage if the laws were fair, but oftentimes by using their money to buy new laws, they wind up paying as low as 1%.  In effect, their money goes to lawyers rather than the government, so they raise taxes for the poor.<br><br><BR>As a child I wanted to know everything.  Now I miss my ignorance.<BR></FONT></td>

MS-DOS has practical uses.

This is trivial I know, and you'll probably discount it, but Linux does run Unreal Tournament much faster and more smoothly on Linux on a Celeron 900MHz CPU than Windows 2000 on a Pentium 4 1.4GHz. Both have the same graphics hardware.<BR>

<BR>
These suites copy the MS Ofice style because it works, they just feel that people shouldn't have to pay for the whole suite if a free, if less feature-packed tool can do the job. Which I think they can. <BR>
<BR>
The only reason I'm not using them in a "genuine" (for want of a better word) manner is because the course heavily involves use of Windows software, and if I need to edit my documents on a University computer then the only software available is MS Word.<BR>
<BR>
Otherwise I think I WOULD be using either KOffice or OpenOffice on a regular basis.<BR>
<BR>
The point of this long post is to try and get across the concept that Linux is either good or bad on the desktop. There's a sliding scale of usefulness. Some people do find that Linux and programs that run under it do the job just as well as their Windows counterparts, and see no justification for buying Windows and MS Office. On the other hand, people might need the extra functionality and relative ease of use of Windows and Windows-based software, so Linux would be a poor choice.<BR>
<BR>
Don't assume that because you don't think it's useful, that it's a universal belief. An open-source operating system isn't universally inferior to a closed-source one which must be paid for.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Unfortunately, the incentive decreases as income rises, but maybe that isn't a bad thing, I don't know. Regardless, it isn't unlike what we have now in the US.<BR><BR>
What bothers me is that your system seems unfair. Why should the people who take risk, as evidenced by their high incomes, have to carry the people who don't, as evidenced by their low incomes? Presumably they have already contributed to society in some large way, most likely by starting a company that employs hundreds if not thousands of workers. Your system relieves the majority of the population from the burden of supporting their government in any way whatsoever, yet they get to reap the benefits.<BR><BR>
On the other hand, the real job of the Federal Government is to provide for the common defense. If we could reign the thing in and get its hands out of all of the social engineering it has been doing I would fully support a realignment of the tax code to fit with your plan. At the moment tax dollars go to fund all sorts of programs that everyone takes advantage of pretty much equally whether rich or poor. If the Federal Government's only job was defense it would stand to reason that the rich should pay more simply because they would have more to protect. Johnny Lunchpail with almost no net worth really has nothing to defend other than his own life. Bill Gates has plenty, a huge home, a giant company, boats, cars, art, etc, etc.<BR><BR>
Maybe a plan like this would go a long way toward eliminating corporate taxes, a scourge upon a capitalist economy and the most widespread hoodwinking of the American people to ever take place.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The best way to protect the properties and position of the rich is not to hire an army of poors to fight the other poors in a permanent state of war (remember the great historical strikes), but to give them a piece of the cake, and the hope they may have a better piece tomorrow.<BR><BR>Your system may seem fairer, and may works, if we accept second zone citizenship, and if we get rid of any notion of human rights, solidarity, etc. But, soon, you'll have to cope with a new Marx, a new Bakounine, a new Engels... and a permanent state of war<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There are serious issues with claiming that 'most' rich people were born with money. When speaking about the Rockefellers and Kennedys, yes, that is true, at least for the current generation. What you fail to mention is that somewhere down the family tree someone took some risk and earned a bunch of money. I don't see why that person shouldn't be able to provide a cushy life for his family in perpetuity. He earned his money after all.<BR><BR>

I also don't see how the fact that the rich need the poor to turn the cranks of their great production machines (as well as to buy the goods produced by those machines) makes any difference to the tax code. The poor guy who bolted the hood on to my Humvee most likely consumes just as many government resources as the guy who owns the factory. The hood bolter contributes less to society though, because any one of a million people can be trained to bolt that hood on, but only one man had the vision to start a Humvee facotry that employs hundreds. That man could also destory the entire company by making a few bad deals (see: Enron) and put all of his employees out of jobs. The hood bolter might mess up a truck or two before someone noticed he wasn't doing his job properly. Regardless, I agree that the best way to ensure that society progresses is for as many people as possible to earn as much money as possible. Even so, there will always be some stratification in income.<BR><BR>

I still don't think I advocated any sort of new tax system, other than the elimination of corporate taxes, which should have never been put in place to begin with. Your system might work, but I don't think it is truly fair. If it were adjusted to require everyone, regardless of income, to contribute to government, even in a very small capacity at income levels below $1M, I might even be in favor of it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The biggest argument to this idea seems to be that there would be no more incentive to work beyond a certain point.  Well, I find that simply hilarious.  How many people making over $1 million actually work for it?  Professional athletes who cry any refuse to play if they don't recieve multi-million dollar contract for playing a game?  CEO's who don't have a clue how their company works and take millions of dollars in bonuses while firing thousands of hard working people?   Movie stars and popular musicians?  Are their "talents" really worth that much?  Basically, no one deserves more that $1 million right now; it's not an incentive, it's just pure greed.  <br><br>
Basically my plan was a limit on what anyone could make in one year.  This would allow for a better distribution of real money among the everyday people.  Not only that, but it would also make many things cheaper.  Some people have so much money they can afford to throw it away for almost nothing.  If no one made more than $1 million, more people would appreciate the value of money.  Sporting events, movies, musical concerts and such would also be cheaper, as less money would be needed to pay off the 'artists' or 'athletes.'  Rather than giving CEO's and other top executives huge bonuses every year, companies would be able to keep more workers, improving the rate of employment.  <br><br>
And if you still think there would be no incentive to work, you obviously don't know the difference between a job paying $15,000 a year and one paying $1,000,000 a year.  Perhaps you know someone who deservers more than this, if so I'd be interested in knowing.  <br><br>
Of course, the fact that I have to explain this saddens me, it just goes to show how many people out there still are just not Adequate.<br><br><BR>As a child I wanted to know everything.  Now I miss my ignorance.<BR></FONT></td>

Pro athletes are the primary players in an industry that rakes in billions. Since their talents are responsible for the existence of the industry in no small way, I don't see why they shouldn't expect a chunk of that. Crying has very little to do with it it seems. If it did, maybe we would see a bunch of guys who try really hard and never complain in the NBA.<BR><BR>

<i>CEO's who don't have a clue how their company works...</i><BR><BR>
This is a common misconception among low level workers. They think that 'knowing how their company works' means knowing how the mail room sorts the mail. No, running a company from the top has a lot more to do with setting direction, influencing corporate culture, watching cash flow, managing inventories, developing partnerships, very generic business fundamentals. That is why CEOs from totally different industries can be successful in new companies.<BR><BR>

<i>Movie stars and popular musicians? Are their "talents" really worth that much?</i><BR><BR>
It appears so as the market is currently paying them quite a bit. If they aren't worth 'that much', why do people buy music or go to movies? Something's worth is not determined by its production cost, or the value that you as an individual place on it, it is determined by general consensus, the market. This is true for capitalist and communist economies alike.<BR><BR>

<i>...it would also make many things cheaper.</i><BR><BR>
Please explain how this would work.<BR><BR>

<i>...companies would be able to keep more workers, improving the rate of employment.</i><BR><BR>
How would this work? Why, if I owned a widget making factory, would I want to employ a bunch of spare workers? Why wouldn't I want to do the same thing I do now, which is employ as few people as possible as cheaply as possible, so I could keep my production costs down?<BR><BR>

You do realize that supply and demand works in both directions? If you want to hire me to build widgets, I might be willing to do that for $100,000 per annum. Maybe you won't pay that, because you can get a guy to do the same job for $99,000 per annum. Given that, please explain why, if you limit the upper end of income, would it result in better distribution of M1 money (I assume you mean M1 money when you write 'real money'). Why would employers pay their workers more for the same work when they can easily get other people to do it for less?

The problems you list are not the fault of rich white men in general, but rather with rich, white, <i>bourgeois</i> men. Historically, the majority of society's ills can be traced to dirty capitalists, forever intent on increasing their monetary holdings at the expense of social stability, public health, and the serenity of the countryside.

<BR><BR>The greatest disasters in history, from the Black Plague to the American Rebellion to the Euro can be traced back to the machinations of the shopkeepers. They have no respect for the state or the general welfare of society. They meddle in government, attempting to infuse it with ignoble notions of "property rights for individuals," as if they, with no hereditary claims whatsoever, could even be said to own property. All property is under the ultimate dominion of the Sovereign, granted to individuals for use toward the betterment of society. That these <i>merchants</i> should try to usurp her rights is an outrage, and must be dealt with strongly and harshly.

<BR><BR>I agree with your solution, Mr. Flynn, but not with your assessment of the problem. The problem is the capitalists, not simply the white ones. The solution is to incarcerate them, strip them of "their" property and render it back to the nobility. Once back in proper hands, the lands and properties currently held ransom by these villains can be directed to the good of all society by gentlemen trained in such pursuits. The nobility is the only class with the requisite skills, heartfelt compassion and divine inspiration necessary to direct a nation's resources. Rather than investing in valueless pursuits such as professional sports and money vaults, the treasury can be allocated towards artistic patronage, the Church, and the preservation of the Commons.  Thus, the state can cease with the multiplication of meaningless wealth and once again progress towards its proper goal: the cultivation and development of good, cultured people.

You'll prevent you mind from being corrupted by whatever radical 'pro-special-rights-for-gay-people' professor teaches it.  Plus, since you won't hear what they're saying, your gag reflexes won't kick in and the other stundents will be able to be indoctrinated without incident.  Better to stick to courses focusing on globalization and economic liberalism so you recognize a good business opportunity next time you see it.  A little money in your pocket will cure you of that nasty, negative attitude you have.

However, it is usually considered good form to check the spelling in your own flame first.<BR>

Also, most of us are 'big picture' thinkers who do not get caught up in the mind numbing minutiae of spelling, grammar, count, etc...  I prefer to leave that to my underlings.  To that end, I hire inner-city youths as paid interns.  They do the petty grunt work of proofreading my correspondence, while I provide them with a hot meal, valuable real-world business experience and act as an upstanding role model of Christian virtue.  Unfortunately, when an intern fails in his duties, he or she must be terminated.  It's a pity, as young Trey Washington had a bright future ahead of him if only he could escape those damned oppressive projects.  Thank you for pointing out his lagging!

<BR>
First, your comment itself is an example of racial profiling. How is it that you think "rich white males" does not pertain to race? If you are against racial profiling, you are against racial profiling. The statement that any "race" should have different rules itself constitutes racism, in its purest form. It does not matter what that "race" is!<BR>
<BR>
Second, no matter how specific or targeted a particular type of profiling, the efficacy of profiling is based on a mathematical myth. Any competent statistician can tell you that profiling is based on a logical fallacy. Applying a population statistic to a particular member of that population just does not work. It is backewards thinking and there is simply no real logical basis for it.<BR>
<BR>
It does not matter what kind of profiling you are talking about. You can base your profile on skin color, nationality, length of hair, stature, income, behavior, profession, or whatever. It just does not work.<BR>
