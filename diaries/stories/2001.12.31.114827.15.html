      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">With many of you, misconceptions spring up whenever the word hacker is mentioned.  Unfortunately the media is responsible for this.  They use the words hack/crack and hacker/cracker synonomously.  The truth is, is that many hackers are the good guys.  Hacker can mean many things.  Steve Wozniak is a perfect example of a hardware hacker.  Software developers can also be called hackers.

<p>Many hackers work for organizations which test the security of various products so that the companies can hopefully design a better security model.  Many are responsible for the Anti-Virus and Firewall programs many of the readers of this site use.

<p><a href="http:www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> unfortunately, rather than a seek out third party, relies mainly on in-house hackers.  This may be why so many concerned hackers set up test systems to hack in order to test the products security model.  These are typically referred to as White Hats (the good guys).  Read what Microsoft had to say about one of these groups.  This information appears at the bottom of the security bulletin regarding the UPnP patch.

<blockquote><i>Microsoft  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/policy.asp">thanks</a>   eEye Digital Security (<a href="http://www.eeye.com">http://www.eeye.com</a>) for reporting this issue to us and working with us to protect customers.</i></blockquote>

So who are the bad guys?  Well these are guys that crack on/off-site systems and then make the information available only to others with malicious intent.  They are known as Black Hats (the bad guys).

<p>So, what does this have to do with Microsoft watching you and the possibilty that someone could steal your life?  A lot.  I used to be one of the good guys.  I am a retired military man.  Now I own a chain of grocery stores.  The only business systems I deal with on a daily basis anymore are mainly cash registers.  However, I still like to keep up to date and I do have a mixed platform home network.

<p>Would you like to know what this security flaw is and how someone could become you?  Take a look <b><a href="http://www.astalavista.com/library/os/win95-98/mshidden.txt">here</a></b>.  <i>This guide was written with Windows 9x in mind, but is not limited to that specific OS</i>.  The guide will also save you quite a bit of money if you previously considered purchasing such products as <a href="http://www.evidences-eliminator.com/">Evidence Eliminator</a>.

<p>Never say a hacker never did anything nice for you.

<p><b>Note to elenchos</b>:  After reading the document the above link refers to, I pose a question to you.  Seeing as how the "problem" can only be fixed by using the command prompt, do you still think it is nothing more than a hacker tool and should be removed?      <br><br></div>

<BR>
The satement that he is a hacker because he has a mixed platform home network does not in any way indicate that he is a hacker. It is quite likely that he could be referring to Windows95/98/ME and WindowsNT/2000/XP as these two OS series are slightly different platforms. Also, even if he is talking about a UNIX based system, it in no way indicates that he is a hacker/cracker. UNIX is a perfectly valid OS developed by the United States military to ensure operation and security over a large ntwork. Because UNIX was developed with these ideas it is an excellent OS to use if you are connecting computers to the internet and exposing them to many unknown dangers. UNIX is the most hacker-proof OS and by useing it as a gateway from your home network to the internet you can put your mind at ease knowing that you are almost invulnerable to most hacker atacks. The only case in which this would not be true is if you work for Microsofts PR department, which I am beginning to believe may be quite possible.<BR>

Everyone knows what "hacker" means.  The Media didn's teach them, they know it just as easily as they know what "dog" or "tree" means.  Or "criminal." And so there is no misconception for you to try to 'correct', any more than you can 'correct'the meaning of "criminal" so that it means "hero".  Hackers are criminals who use computers to break the law and hurt innocent people.  You can't define your way out of that.
<BR><BR>
Why work so hard to introduce this confusing hacker/cracker distinction?  Espcially in choosing a word that already has a definition of its own, being a racial ephitet against whites used by non-whites and others (with varying degrees of irony of course).  The goal is to try to legitimize using a computer to break the law and hurt innocent people, by somehow making it seem okay through your little linguistic shell game.  
<BR><BR>
What a cheap trick! And upon realizing that no one but stoned hackers, their minds rotted by video games, is buying it, you flail about for someone to blame for the scam's failure.  Who?  The Media, of course.  Sad.
<BR><BR>
Now what is your damn question?  I don't even know why command lines are such a big deal.  Isn't that just one of a very large class of things that let you use a computer in ways it was not specifically designed to be used?  Yes, so ban command lines, along with all those hundreds of other things, and save the world from hacking.

<BR>
Windows is known to many as the Everybody OS.  Closed minded people like yourself with limited computer knowledge think just because all you use a computer for is "surfing the web" and word processing that that is what a computer is designed for.<BR>
<BR>
Also I asked if the command prompt should be banned not the command line.  Apparently you have never created a shortcut in Windows.  Sure you may do it by clicking pictorial representations (icons) but Windows fills in the command line based on those selections.  Why?  So that the user can add additional switches (hope that's not too advanced for ya) to increase the ease of use.<BR>
<BR>
I would seriously love to see you partition a hard drive or run through a hardware diagnostic program without a command prompt.  Of course rather than making a boot disk you would rather pay $50 for a partitioning program.  You'll come to see how a command prompt really pays off when you get tired of sending your computer off to a "professional".  Of course without people like you, they would never make any money.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

I don't see it as a solution for the same reasons.  It also means that companies will have to switch to MS only products as will users to benefit fully from it.  There is an open source project called Mono that will "supposedly" link non-Windows platforms to .NET.

<BR><BR>Microsoft's goals with their software implementations have been visible since they started (successfully) lobbying states to pass legislation allowing businesses to claim ownership rights over software to the degree that they can legally deactivate software if the company judges its use to fall outside of their acceptable usage criteria.  Their product activation system is another step in that direction.  As far as I can tell from the reviews I've read about XP (I have a concrete policy of not touching any Microsoft product without at least two bugfix releases), it has all of the elements in place, they're just waiting to implement the policy.

<BR><BR>Microsoft believes that to continue to make money, they've got to have an increase in control over their software.  As an individual with only a basic education in legal matters, their actions seem to strike me as monopolistic, but that's an old straw and one I'm not going to debate here.  Microsoft is in the business of making money, and they succeed brilliantly.  In the process, they also seem to be interested in telling the users what to expect from software, and they also tend to succeed in that.  I admire their effectiveness, but not their results.

<BR><BR>Well, the good news is that Microsoft's policy can't be grandfathered.  Older software like 98 doesn't support the .NET vision.  Microsoft can control this by refusing to support it, but that won't bother people who are used to debugging it anyway.  They can try to convince the market that open source software is dangerous and unreliable, but that won't stop people who are actively involved in it.  So my next step is to get off my duff and start learning more about Unix administration.  It's time to stop being just a user.<BR><BR><BR>A troll's <a href="./2002.1.5.184242.7637.html#31">true colors</a>.<BR></FONT></td></tr>

This is the natural consequence of fanaticism:  unable to see anything except enemies or allies, the fanatic soon begins to magnify even the slightest difference with his apparent friends and then re-categorizes anyone who falls outside of the ever-newer, ever more narrow definition of "friend" as a sworn enemy.   This characterized the French and Russian Revolutions, not to mention the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and we see it today in the Lunix cult.

Why do you think there are so many fractious, competing versions of Lunix and it's various components and philosophical gurus?
<BR><BR>
As far as your sophistry about command line interfaces, or command prompts (as if that mattered), obviously a machine that allows this much flexibility doesn't belong in public circulation, because it isn't done yet.  To say it was "designed" do to an infinite number of things is nonsense.  In fact, no design was done, but rather the design task was left <i>un-done</i>, allowing hackers free reign.  A <i>completely designed</i> computer would perform the task you wished to do with it, like a banking transaction, or viewing a web page, and nothing else, no matter what a malicious user tried.
<BR><BR>
The public-- %99.99998 of computer customers-- is clamoring for such a well-designed computer, one that is both safe from hacking and easy to use.  Picture it, and you are picturing our future.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Even the ATM example makes nonsense of that:  a banking transaction can be made up of many different functions, like getting cash or checking a balance.  All on one device.  The thing is, there are a pre-defined, finite number of these functions, and no user can add more.  
<BR><BR>
A desktop computer will work in exactly the same way.  It will give normal people all the functions they need and want, whether it is their word processing or web surfing, but not leave any blank slates that normal people don't need.  The kind of wide-open, undefined functionality that command prompts and text editors and compilers provide is used by no one but hackers to attack decent society.

<BR><BR>You have to partition a hard drive before you can format it and store data to it.  You don't think "people" will do this?  Kind of difficult not to if you plan on dual booting.

<b>I have better things to do than decipher your techno-babble. Whatever "convert the file system from FAT32 to NTFS"</b>

<BR><BR>You must format the hard drive before you can copy data to it.  You have to select what file system you use.  As I said, upgrade from 98 to XP.  Win98 can only read FAT and FAT32 while NT based OSes (NT4, W2K, XP) can read FAT, FAT32, and NTFS.  NTFS = New Technology File System.  That's what NT stands for in Windows NT, NEW TECHNOLOGY.

<BR><BR>The simple fact that you have such a hard time grasping simple concepts such as formatting, partitioning, and file systems is not surprising.

<BR><BR>There are already partitioning tools with a cute little graphical interface.  If you know where to find them many are FREE.  However, not all of them are capable of readfing anything beyond FAT and FAT32.  Hell the fdisk utility you get when making a boot disk in MSDOS can read NTFS partitions.

<BR><BR>I don't think anyone besides a couple of retards on EBay are dumb enough to worry about writing a graphical interface to format a drive/partition.  How difficult is it to boot to a command prompt and type <b>FORMAT [drive letter]</b>?  Not to mention the format utility would be limited to the file systems available to it.  Most will only format the drive as FAT (FAT16) which limits drive space to 2GB.  If you're lucky you get FAT32.  Wooooo.

<BR><BR><b>Does the CMOS for your computer have a command line? You're damned right it doesn't. And there's good reason for that, Skippy.</b>

<BR><BR>All CMOS does is holds the user defined set up for BIOS.  It's storage is not large enough for a command interpretor, shell, and every other little thing you would need.  Not to mention the because the interface for BIOS is not universal you would have to relearn how to play with CMOS everytime you bought a new computer.

<BR><BR><b> It will happen, OK? Your obsession with the command line is really going to bite you in the ass when Microsoft finally manages to do away with its last vestiges.</b>

<BR><BR>I don't have an obsession with the command line.  I'm saying there is a lot of life left in the Command PROMPT.  But you want to talk about command line?  Fine we will.  Windows still uses the command line.  When you double click (or sinlge click if you selected that option) an icon it executes a command line.  A user can change it, or modify it if they want to.  It's designed to make things easier having a icon.  As long as it works this way, the command prompt and command line will still be accessible to the user.

<BR><BR>I don't know why you think the command prompt is such a huge deal.  I really wish this whole Linux=command prompt thing will stop.  Most anything I want to do in a Linux based OS I can do with the GUI, but not all.  Same goes for Windows.  I am referring to legitimate things, not "hacker things" like somemany of you immatures readers would assume.  I find that people who know the least about a subject are the ones who want to start the most arguments about it.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

First personal computers were assembled by hackers. First calendars were created by their astronomy equivalents. The first ape that tried to walk on the ground was a "walking hacker" of a kind.

Reminds me the continual clashes between technicians and lawmakers/lawyers. The lawyers are largely unaware that without the role of technicians (and especially the techno-pioneers, <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">hackers</a>) throughout the history they would still have court sessions on trees and their wages would be in bananas.

<BR><BR><b>Criminals deserve no credit for the work done by real scientists and engineers.</b>

<BR><BR>Well Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs had a shady past.  Look what they did.  Every professional knows that for most good ideas (hardware and software) most people look to Apple.  I mean come on, just look at the new Compaq design.  Can you say iMac?  Don't even get me started on Windows.

<BR><BR><b>How could this Gates have ever done anything, good or bad, that changes the fact that hackers have stolen and continue to steal credit for things they didn't do?</b>

<BR><BR>Just a scecond

<BR><BR><b>So as usual, I must demand that hackers cease stealing credit for things they didn't do. And while you're at it, cease all hacker stealing.</b>

<BR><BR>Maybe you wanna talk about criminal stealing ideas and claiming them as their own.  Hmmm, let's talk about Bill Gates.  Along with his buddy Paul Allen they wrote BASIC.  Ok I'll give them credit for that.  They went to IBM and said we have this operating system called...DOS.  Guess what.  They did have squat.  They heard about this guy, Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Company who did though.  What he actually had was a backwards engineered <b>copy</b> of Gary Kildall's CP/M.  He called it QDOS and it ran on Intel's 8086 processor.  I guess he couldn't wait for CP/M-86 which would release not too long afterwards.

<BR><BR>So in comes Paul Allen of [then] who offers Tim $50,000 for QDOS.  They then license it to IBM under the name MSDOS.  Once again don't even get me started on Windows.  You see yes MS <i>did</i> actually create Windows.  But what <i>they</i> created was a suite that ran under DOS.

<BR><BR><b>Criminals and hackers could never get into or graduate from a University</b> <i>SUMMARIZED</i>

<BR><BR>Kinda of like Bill Gates and Paul Allen who dropped out the junior year at Harvard?  Oh, I know you think the <i>honorary</i> degree Gates received from Harvard counts don't ya?  Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak went to Univ of Calif at Berkeley.

<BR><BR><b>It makes no sense. The reason hackers hack is because their limited abilities and tempermental flaws, as well as basic immorality, prevent them from being accepted where the real work of civilization goes on, such as at MIT.</b>

<BR><BR>And to think that Bill Gates was set to go to MIT.  Many hackers have graduated from MIT.

<BR><BR><b>Why do you think my concern for the ravages of hackers against civilization have anything to do with Micro-Soft or this Gates person?</b>

<BR><BR>Plenty

<BR><BR><b>How could his history or his company's policies change the truth about hackers? What is it that vindicates hacker criminals here? That this Gates person has a DUI or something? How does that make hacking less criminal?</b>

<BR><BR>That depends.  If you look at Bill's history one way it make hackers (even the respectable ones) look bad.  The simple fact that you hold Windows, Microsoft, and Gates up to be holier than thou show that hackers have done some pretty amazing things.

<BR><BR><b>Ask yourself the simple question: if any hacker had the credentials and qulifications to successfully invent, develop, or maintain any useful technology, why are they hacking instead of doing respectable work?</b>

<BR><BR>That all depends on your definition of hacker.  If you use the true <a href="./2001.12.31.114827.15.html#47">definition</a> then hackers are professionals with well paying jobs.  If you use <i>the adequacy.org</i> definition of hacker then you're still wrong.  Not all the bad guys are unemployeed.  Many are enrooled at Universities to (the first Internet worm was released by a University student) others work in various fields.
<BR><BR><b>Which, by the way, is NOT a criminal organization, in spite of the constant hacker propaganda that they have infiltrated it.</b>

<BR><BR>Once again it depends on your definition of hacker.

<BR><BR>That's right you have never posted about the great Windows and about how poor Billy has been force by the "hacker community" (your words, not mine) to include "hacker tools" in Windows.

<BR><BR><b>if any hacker had the credentials and qulifications to successfully invent, develop, or maintain any useful technology, why are they hacking instead of doing respectable work?</b>

<BR><BR>I wanna revisit this.  If you look at Microsoft's <a href="./2001.12.31.114827.15.html#54">history</a> than I guess <i>they</i> don't do any <i>respectable</i> work then huh?  Also your call for a BAN on various programming tools mean people like Bill Gates would never get anywhere.

It's unbelievable how obsessed you are with this man.  I hope his security personnel are keeping an eye on you, because it has gone from a creepy nerosis wherin you substitute Micro-Soft and it's founder for your distant and weak father and turned it into some kind of Jodie Foster thing.

You have to try to come back to reality.  Nobody else thinks Micro-Soft is the center of the universe!  Nobody else thinks that just because Micro-Soft did it, that makes it okay.  They are not the arbiters of all that is right and wrong.  Just because you (think you) can show that this person Gates or his company broke a law, that does <i>not</i> justify you breaking any laws.  They're just some big corporation.
<BR><BR>
And Bill Gates is not your "Darth Vader" either.  He is not your True Father, turned to evil, whom you must rebel agaist and hate, while secretly craving his approval.

<BR><BR>As far as my sophistry concerning command lines goes, what I've described is the modern standard for a personal computer.  What you predict for the future of computing is a single-function device useful for one purpose only, instead of the multi-tasking environment that is currently in vogue.  This does not change it from being a computer, it just assumes a larger shift in industry demand than I think is reasonable.  My reading in the tech industry indicates that users are asking for <em>more</em> flexibility and customization, not less.  Granted, they want this without sacrificing security, as seems to be your greatest issue, but I think you have the market's priorities slightly skewed.  Even the small hand-held devices are being asked to perform multi-tasking duties ranging from entertainment to communication to data input and storage.

<BR><BR>In short, my sophistry stands.  A personal computer is defined less by what it can do than by what it cannot.<BR><BR><BR>A troll's <a href="./2002.1.5.184242.7637.html#31">true colors</a>.<BR></FONT></td></tr>

a) Because unix people are well-aware that one solution doesn't fit all. Notice the differences between the distributions (NOT versions - as was said here many times, Linux is only the kernel, and it is the same in the distros; the difference is in default configurations and in included software). Because unix people don't have Big Corporate Management breathing down their neck and pressing them to do things One Microsoft Way so they can actually do things the good way.

<i>The public-- %99.99998 of computer customers-- is clamoring for such a well-designed computer, one that is both safe from hacking and easy to use. Picture it, and you are picturing our future.</i>
<BR><BR>
Nintendo future!
<BR><BR>
Now seriously. What can be considered "easy to use"? How many VCRs still have blinking 12:00 on their displays? Is it possible to dumb down the already point-and-drool interface even more? For what price? What about instead of bringing computers down to the level of Average Users rather try to force the users to actually <b>think</b>? Or is technical thinking a lost art in the "developed" Western World?
<BR><BR>
I heard a lot of stories of <a href="http://rinkworks.com/stupid/">user stupidity</a> and personally witnessed some of them. What I seen greatly lowered my expectations about human race.
<BR><BR>
There is no thing like a complete computer, and never will be. I want my computers to offer the ultimate flexibility, to do whatever I want whenever I want, when in most cases I don't know in advance what I will need. If possible, in a transparent way, without hiding behind truecolor pointclickistic interface. As far, the only way to achieve that was through scripting languages and gcc. You will have to pry the compiler from my dead cold fingers. Deal with it.
<BR><BR>
Non-hackable <b>isn't</b>. You can make it quite difficult, though. But you have to learn, or hire an expert.
<BR><BR>
It is nearly impossible to ban (and technically impossible to enforce it) commandline-based systems. They are way too powerful (so their users will just not give them away - I don't personally know a single techie for whom Law is more than Code), and way too easy to implement (I once implemented a rudimentary commandline interface on a onechip microcontroller) (so even if a miracle would happen and someone would seize existing systems, it is trivial to make basic tools and by using them to make more advanced tools). Also, where there is a demand there is the supply. Check the history (Prohibition), and look around (black markets of all kinds - from drugs to fissile materials). Face it: hackers will get what they want. Deny them tools, they make them themselves.
<BR><BR>
Personally I prefer being aware about the dangers in the wild, and I prefer the dangers being so high that they stimulate the means of defense. Imagine the world without "in-the-wild" crackers and virus writers. You think the "black arts" wouldn't exist? The idea of using viruses and worms for military purposes is as old as the networks themselves.
<BR><BR>
No, I will prefer the Net with viruses and script-kiddies - and with readily available defense means (firewalls, encrypted packet tunnels, intrusion detectors, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">secure operating systems</a>[1]...), where there is a reason to do things securely by default, and where there is permanent state of battle preparedness on both sides. Security isn't easy nor cheap thing to do so there have to be some incentives. Blessed be the threats.
<BR><BR>
Imagine having the "pathogen-free" sterile Net, and imagine the impact of a coordinated attack led against it by a well-trained well-financed adversary (for Americans ie. China, for non-Americans ie. USA, for everyone ie. CIA). Take this as a homework.
<BR><BR>
[1] Nothing is absolutely secure. But OpenBSD is the best you can get without really big hassle and/or expenses. And yes, source codes available.

I don't care about suits. I prefer military surplus. Has more pockets, requires no maintenance, is cheaper, and I can go through fire, fog, fall, and maintenance ducts and then just dust myself off. Suits suck for any real application and are good only as a show-off.

At this moment, I do web browsing on Windows machine, and everything more serious - from email to writing code and texts to databases to file archive to firewall - doing on Linux machine (firewall is scheduled to be overhauled to BSD). (Special case here; I need heterogenous network for testing and general playing with. Regarding games, I sadly don't have much time for them :(, so can't comment (reminds me, I should dust off my C64 emulator). Even when writing a longer thing for Adequacy, I write it as a text file (saved frequently for case of crash) and then move it to the browser via clipboard; I need too many windows opened in parallel at once, and Billy's Superior Technology sometimes decides to crash and close all the IE windows. (Not speaking about mysterious resource drains linked to running instances of MSIE.)

When will you people have consistency?</i>
<BR><BR>
My reference to Nintendo future was a reference to game consoles in general - small relatively reliable single-purpose machines; I don't have enough experience with the world of game consoles to know any dirt about them. I personally have gripes with Sony (though their electronics is good). (By the way, where I mentioned Sony before?)
<BR><BR>
<i>You watch too much television. Most people who have VCRs these days are able to adjust the clock. There might be some VCRs that have not been set, and usually it is because they have no need to use the VCR as a clock.</i>
<BR><BR>
VCRs need clock as time reference for programmed recording.
<BR><BR>
Personally, I got my VCR from my parents; el-cheapo (about $25 few years ago and worth about as much - sucks, heads need realignment or even exchange (not worth of the hassle), occassionally loses colors and then needs to be banged on its side, but enough for time-shifting news and Star Dreck, so reliably (except the color thing) doing everything I want; when I will not be lazy I'll get new old one and take this one apart for fun).
I am very happy with it - it is so old it has full set of controls on its panel (in fact I hadn't had to touch the remote from when I got it), can be programmed from panel, and one doesn't have to argue with obscure menus nor have to switch the TV on when setting it up. One sets few registers, like when setting up digital wristwatches, and it does what asked for; no droolproof TV-based interface that takes several times as long to program. I like it this way; however, getting new model with these features is rather nontrivial, as the VCRs are designed mostly for couch potatoes who sit outside the reach of the device, and every button is added cost. If they'd at least open the control bus specs so I could attach a front panel tailored to my desires, or ultimately to connect it to computer and program via commandline, I'd be happy.
<BR><BR>
Of course, modern VCRs have more features - automatic clock settings according to data in topmost TV scanlines, and all sorts of other services - I am not a home-video buff and it's couple years I was interested in there anyway; what I am pondering is to get a TV capture card (plenty of spare CPU power and disk space) and make fully computerized open-standards-based TiVo-like device. Until someone will crack the proprietary ShowView/VideoPlus+/VCRPlus+ scheme, I will lack this - but no big loss for now and the efforts are underway. It is also possible to automatically cut off the ads from the resulting MPEG stream; I have several methods in proposal stage for when I will be in playful mood.
<BR><BR>
<i>If VCR zealots were as psychotic as you Linux apologists, they'd not only make it extremely difficult to set, but they'd make hundreds of different VCR versions... excuse me, DISTRIBUTIONS... made specifically for each genre.</i>
<BR><BR>
As long as the tapes can be moved between them - OKAY WITH ME! Hypothetically: If you want super-quality sound and don't care much about picture, SymphonicVCR is here for you. If you like movies and want surround sound and enhanced image, get ActionVCR, and if you want just to timeshift news and don't care about anything other than cost, get BarebonesVCR. If you are into scuba diving and want to watch tapes under water, WaterproofVCR is here for you. If you don't need TV output at all but need input/output as ISO MPEG stream, get MPEGVCR. If you attach/detach devices from it frequently, install front-panel mod with connectors of your desire, and if you like solid industrial design, get rack-mount mod. If you want something not on the market, take soldering iron, or - if you don't know what its end is the hot one - ask a friend or hire a specialist. As long as the casettes are recorded all in the same format and can be moved from one VCR type to another, WHY THE HELL NOT?
<BR><BR>
At least you will still have control over the device, will know what is happening inside, and can be sure there will be no proprietary extensions that will one day forbid you from taping some things, as MPAA wants to (see lower), or fastforwarding through ads. (Or that there will be easy ways around them.) (See DVD zones and associated problematics. DVDs aren't common here enough for me to worry about it yet, but I don't think I will buy a player that will not have published a dezoning crack.) The days of taping a show for a friend (without having to ask The Underground for help) can be gone sooner than you think (check some digital TV proposals). But it is a topic for entirely different thread and for its own.

They have a lot of technical influence, and contacts. This is what <i>really</i> matters.
<BR><BR>
A law can tell you what you can't do with your equipment. However, it can't <i>force</i> you to comply. The keywords are <b>civil disobedience</b> and <b>passive resistance</b>.
<BR><BR>
According to my experiences, there are three classes of people:
<BR><BR>
Law-Abiding Citizens: They get scared by the very idea of the Holy Law being questioned. They comply with everything that is told them.
<BR><BR>
Normal Citizens: They appear like law-abiding citizens while attempting to not be inconvenienced by them too much. Typical customers of "unofficial" hardware/software mod vendors. They kept my income on survivable level while I was still freelancing. They are the majority. (Don't know how in the US - maybe people are more coward there).
<BR><BR>
The Underground: The subculture that forms around the Forbidden Arts. Some tinkering with hightech for fun, some for profit. Normal Citizens are their happy clients. Not all of their activities are necessarily sinister; Law-Abiding Citizens fear them, but Normal Citizens usually have friends in this class, who care about their computers, get new ones for them and assemble them from parts, do the services Commercial Subjects either don't offer at all, or for too high prices, or unreliably. Such relationships are usually long-term and personal, where the mutual knowledge of the parties serves as a warranty that the delivered work will be worth of the money/services paid for it (on one side) and that the payment will not be withhold (on the other side). They are The Ones Who Know, a heretic priesthood of the contemporary society. Normal Citizens benefit from them, and supply them with goods. (A friend in a service shop is the best way how to "tunnel" couple pages from a desired "authorized servicemen only" manual out.)

You added the Normal Citizens into the equation? Couple many people do offsite backups. A FTP directory on a server in Australia and a "sister" one in Yugoslavia, a CD in a drawer across the city, a CD with garage-band music tracks (with steganography-encoded files) donated to a student club...
<BR><BR>
<i>and though you may hope that going house to house wiping hard drives of illegal programs is unthinkable, for ordinary, normal people, it is just common sense, if it means fewer computer headaches and hacker-caused disasters.</i>
<BR><BR>
...and more computer headaches and corporate-strategies-caused disast...errr...feature side effects. And liquidation of the class that keeps Normal Citizens' machines up and running. And deterring many potential future technicians from pursuing The Crafts, thus creating catastrophical shortage of skills for the future.
<BR><BR>
It would require to toss essential privacy protections out of the window, which would alienate a lot of both Normal Citizens and Law-Abiding Citizens. The Goon Squads would also have to find all the backup CDs and all the offshore backup sites[1]. They would also have to make all the people with the skills to forget them (with the side effect of the IT-powered economy grinding to halt) or risking that the IT people will keep a side income stream by doubling as Underground Guys. If a single copy remains unfound, it can spread all over the world again; *every* file once was a single-of-its-kind copy. Steganography makes this task even more frustrating. You would have to monitor all the data transfers (down to the level of entropy monitoring (the essential part of steganalysis)), ban encryption (again an enforcement problem for its own), control all phone calls, every swap of a piece of paper or a floppy in a mall, every private conversation... (Personal question: Would you like to live in such society? Before you answer, remember: The Ones Who Make Rules can tighten them at whim, leaving you no choice than to obey.)
<BR><BR>
Hard to do and will piss off too many people. Not everyone feels comfortable to disclose their secrets to untrusted third party.
<BR><BR>
Plus you would have to do it internationally and all at the same moment. People know each other overseas; I have couple accounts all over the world, usually in exchange for coadmining the machine or other kinds of little perks. I even run a CGI-based HTTPS proxy/anonymizer for friends in China and Middle East, whose governments routinely filter Net access. For exchange for a postcard here and there, and first-hand situation reports - usually more reliable than corporate-sanitized news (if they even are), or other little services, usually translations. (I possess many skills, but Chinese and Arabic isn't between them. :( )
<BR><BR>
<i>Therefore, that whole long post about how important these tools are to you and how much you need them amounts to nothing. Normal people don't need them and never use them and will not miss them one bit.</i>
<BR><BR>
Until a Common Citizen gets a disk crash (the Superior Operating System (hi, Bill!) occassionally decides to dump the memory over first dozens of disk tracks - of course, over FATs and root directory)[2]. Then he will bloody miss the Underground Guy with his service floppy and a pirate copy of Norton Disk Editor.<br>
This applies even to the lower-budget Law-Abiding Citizens; many of them reorder their priorities when they find about the costs of data recovery services.
<BR><BR>
<i>You must get that through your head. "Pry it from my cold dead fingers" indeed! Easy as pie!</i>
<BR><BR>
<b>Try it!</b>[3]
<BR><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR><BR>
[1] Which can't be done all houses/appartments at once; it would require more policemen than the entire country population is. Sequential approach would require literally shutting down all the communications (so Normal Citizens can't alert their Underground friends) and all physical movements. (Which itself can be a hint that something catastrophical is going on.) Hiding a few of most important CDs can be done in few minutes, especially when it was counted with before; complete search (including disassembling of all devices and furniture and floors...) of every household is de facto impossible. Attempt to do so nationwide would most likely trigger large-scale riots, maybe even a revolution.
<BR><BR>
[2] Some viruses do it as well (example: Win32/CIH, aka Chernobyl - completely destroys typical FAT16 installation, heavily to moderately damages FAT32 systems). I was doing repairs of system areas mostly manually, as most of common damages obliterated just first few tracks, FAT2 stayed operational, and MBR and bootsector can be reconstructed with aid of a calculator. When CIH stroke first time, I got three FAT16 disks to rescue data from in a single day, so I had to write a two-pass scanner: first pass searched for directories on the disk, created lists of filenames, filesizes, and starting clusters, and saved it to another disk. Then take the list, select the files you want, do a short prayer asking for no fragmentation of critical files, and run second pass: a simplified version of Undelete. Take line by line, calculate the number of clusters to read, read them sequentially from the starting cluster acquired from first pass, and saved them to another drive. This is the ultimate way to salvage at least something even from the heaviest-damaged FAT filesystems. Imagine how much you would have to pay to Authorized Service. If you kept confidential data there, you would also have to trust the Authorized Service's staff. With already-established years-proven trust relationship between the Normal Citizen and the Underground Guy, this is not a problem. "Official" corporate structures will never achieve this degree of trust. Been there.
<BR><BR>
[3] Or maybe my grasp of English isn't firm enough and "easy as a pie" actually means "difficult as hell". Then you would be right.

<i>As for your fourth link, do you really trust an "article" written by someone hiding behind a ridiculous pseudonym like "The Riddler"?</i>
<BR><BR>
The article is technically sound. There is a lot of underground writers, publishing good texts under various monikers; they write for their subculture and their alias becomes their "trademark". It is identifier like any other; there is no reason why an article (or a novel, or anything) written under an alias would necessarily have to be worse than an article written under real name. In the age of indirect threats and lawyers behind every corner, hiding one's true identity isn't necessarily a sign of malice per se - rather just a common-sense caution. Especially when one writes about a product of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">bunch of rich criminals</a>.

Similarly, when an article is written under writer's original identity, doesn't obviously make it Absolute Truth as well.
<BR><BR>
(Just because someone is written as an author doesn't mean he is really the author; a <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a> signature is better.)
<BR><BR>
But this is why we have something called Critical Thinking. By coupling the <a href="http://www.astalavista.com/library/os/win95-98/mshidden.txt">article in question</a> with already existing technical knowledge, one can validate the article claims, then ultimately validate them by an experiment.
<BR><BR>
It doesn't matter if the article is signed as Peter Smith, John Doe, or The Riddler. As long as the author uses his/her ID consistently, the name can serve as a "trademark" of writing style, and ultimately can become a sorta-warrant of the content quality. Or not. But, as I said in the previous paragraph, what ultimately matters is if it gives sense when coupled together with third-party knowledge, and then how it works when deployed in Real World.

There is a popular misunderstanding about lawsuits - that they are "waged" only in order to win. A lawsuit by its nature consumes alot of resources of both sides, in both time, money (check lawyers fees), and stress. When there is sufficiently enough disparity in the opponents' resources, a tactical lawsuit can be launched even when it is evident it will be lost - in order to drain the adversary's resources, or to partially block them. Most people, when confronted by a Corporation, decide to decline and duck and cover, instead of going into a fight. Even when they could have good chance of victory. Effects of a several years long lawsuit, when the more-resourceful party twists the legal system to their advantage and fills more and more motions and delays and more and more sessions (which all cost lawyer fees) can be devastating on both property and morale of the less-resourceful side. Regardless of their relative legal status. And if they run out of money before their adversary runs out of legal tricks, tough luck.

No individuals at Microsoft have been convicted for any of the so-called offences that you accused them of. There is no evidence to suggest that Microsoft employs criminals.<BR><BR>
On the other hand, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=convicted+hacker&btnG=Google+Search">numerous hackers have been convicted of criminal offences</a>.

If you let hackers define the term "hacker", their definition is bound to portray them in a favourable light. However, the accepted definition of the word "hacker" based on common usage (and in linguistic matters, common usage tends to take priority over what is strictly correct) is someone who illegally accesses computer systems.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>How do you know this?  Maybe you are just a Microsoft PR guy.  Can you show evidence that MS does <i>not</i> hire criminals (knowingly or otherwise)?  I mean come on.  You can turn on the the Discovery channel and The Learning Channel and learn how the FBI has put cracker on the payroll in order to catch cyber-terrorists.

<BR><BR>It really depends on your meaning.  If I say MS hires hackers in the sense that I use hackers to mean knowlegeable computer professionals I am correct.  As far a common use of a term becoming the definition that's a load of crap.  You claim the Adequacy.org is the most contreversial site on the Internet.  In other word you use Internet as if it means the same thing as web (WWW).  Sorry not so.  You can look up the <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> and you will find to different definitions.  Stupid people who "can't talk could" will tell you otherwise.  I mean if I get half the population of the US to say that a cat is a dog, does that make it true?<BR><BR>

<b>Microsoft have a good reputation as a law-abiding company.</b>

<BR><BR>So that whole thing with the Justice Department was just a dream I had?  They were found quilty of multiple violations of the Sherman Act including bundling products in which they did not hold a monopoly with products to which they did.  Gee wonder why?  So they could have a monopoly on that product as well?  This is not the first time Microsoft has been investigated by the Justice Department.  

<BR><BR>Bill Gates thought the Justice Department couldn't do anything because it would be Double Jeopardy.  Sorry, Billy but you are not being charge for being a monopoly then.  You are charged for being a monopoly NOW (suit filed May 1998 by the attonery generals of 20 states and the District of Columbia).  Hell Bill, IBM was found to be a monopoly on 3 different occassions (1932, 1952, 1969).  Don't get me started on AT&T.

<BR><BR>Just because the settlement proposed by the Justice Department was a joke does not mean MS was not found guilty.  Nine states are still holding out and many people believe the Justice Department has been bought.  MS even stated publicly that they will pay for all the legal expenses the states incurred if the 9 remaining states will agree.  Gee, I wonder why.

<BR><BR>Would you like a couple of examples?<BR><BR>

<i><b>Quarterdeck</b></i>

<blockquote><i>Quarterdeck Corporation of Santa Monica, California (now owned by Symantec) was the inventor of the key memory-management code that allows a computer to switch from "real mode" to "protected mode." The innovation allowed for memory remapping, program swapping, and large applications to run on personal computers.<BR><BR>

Without this ingenious programming step, all Intel-based DOS PCs would have been limited to a few tiny text-base programs running on a DOS screen. In other words, Windows could not exist.<BR><BR>

How did Microsoft treat potential competitor Quarterdeck? Microsoft used the step in its own memory tool for DOS. Then Microsoft apparently rigged Windows so that it would become unstable if a directory called "QEMM" existed on a PC hard drive.<BR><BR> 

"QEMM" was Quarterdeck's flagship product and income source. Microsoft, many believe, also attempted to mislead Quarterdeck by claiming that the smaller company should develop a new GUI that would ride on top of Windows95, which Quarterdeck could then sell to PC makers for preload purposes.<BR><BR> 

However, Microsoft had already made contracts with PC makers forbidding them to load any such GUI. Apparently, Microsoft's intent was to have Quarterdeck waste time and resources developing a product that Microsoft had already banned from the market. Of course that tactic shows clearly that the PC market is not really a free market. Microsoft can ban any competing software through contracts, predatory program design -- or both.</i></blockquote>

<i><b>What about STAC?</b></i>

<blockquote><i>STAC Electronics developed a hard-disk compression scheme that allowed PCs to store 1.5 to 2.5 as much data on a hard drive. Even today, this would be quite useful for notebook PCs and embedded systems. 

However, Microsoft copied this code and embedded it into MSDOS 6.0 as "DoubleSpace." Microsoft was found liable in civil court and later paid $83 million in damages, according to reports on the case. 

But very few companies have the resources that STAC did to fight for years for their legal rights against giant, well-financed Microsoft's legal steamroller.</i></blockquote>

<b><i>Go Next</i></b>

<blockquote><i>Tiny company Go Corp. invented pen-based computing in the early 1990s. When invited to consider selling its technology to Microsoft, Go gladly agreed to have a "marketing guy" from Microsoft examine the product. Instead, several Microsoft programmers -- who many say were pretending to be marketers -- spent three days poring over every detail of the source code for Go's flagship product.<BR><BR> 

Then they pronounced it a dud and left town. Six months later, Microsoft began offering a similar product using Go's approach -- and dared Go to sue them. Next thing you know, Go went bankrupt and disappeared.</i></blockquote>

We could list hundreds of similar cases -- the strangling of Netscape via product giveaways, the disappearance of applications for OS/2 when Microsoft refused to provide development tools it had sold to independent developers, the booby-trapped code in Windows 3.1 to target DR-DOS, threatening to pull applications out from under Apple's nose -- but time does not permit a full list with descriptions of all the alleged wrongs.<BR><BR> 

But, believe me, those of you who think Microsoft is a "success" or an "innovator" are being deceived.

There are peculiarities in corporate law that I don't understand. Logically, a corporation's will is a combination of wills of the corporation's leaders. Any corporation's action necessarily has to originate from a physical person. So this physical person should be considered responsible. If not fully responsible, then at least as a crime aid.

<i>However, the accepted definition of the word "hacker" based on common usage (and in linguistic matters, common usage tends to take priority over what is strictly correct) is someone who illegally accesses computer systems.</i>
<BR><BR>
Depends on who uses the word. I personally consider the New Hacker Dictionary (alias the Jargon File) as canonical reference.

<i>You're the sort of apologist who thinks that terrorists are actually "freedom fighters".</i>
<BR><BR>
Back at the times of Nazi occupations, local forests were infested by guerrilas. They were ambushing German transports, assasinating German officers and leaders. (I have no doubts Germans would call them terrorists, if the word would be in so wide usage back then as it is now. Now they are the Freedom Fighters[1]. If Nazis would win the war, they would stay terrorists.)
<BR><BR>
Too many things depend on perspective...
<BR><BR>
[1] They even sometimes extracted food and materials from the civilians at a gunpoint (this part of history was later quite suppressed after the War when the guerrilas switched assignment from being the Officially Bad Ones to being the Officially Good Ones). (In other cases, civilians were voluntarily helping. The actual situations are most likely dependent on the levels of civilian cooperation vs the guerrilas' hunger.)

<blockquote><i>A person who writes programs in assembly language or in system-level languages, such as C. Although it may refer to any programmer, it implies very tedious "hacking away" at the bits and bytes.

<BR><BR>Since it takes an experienced hacker to gain unauthorized entrance into a secure computer to extract information and/or perform some prank or mischief at the site, the term has become synonymous with "<a href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.yb?term=cracker">cracker</a>," a person that performs an illegal act. This use of the term is not appreciated by the overwhelming majority of hackers who are honest professionals.</i></blockquote>

<a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/hacker.html">Oh, here's a good one</a>

<blockquote><i>A slang term for a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/computer.html">computer</a>  enthusiast, i.e., a person who enjoys learning <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/programmer.html">programming</a> languages and computer systems and can often be considered an expert on the subject(s). Among professional programmers , depending on how it used, the term can be either complimentary or derogatory, although it is developing an increasingly derogatory connotation. The pejorative sense of hacker is becoming more prominent largely because the popular press has coopted the term to refer to individuals who gain unauthorized <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/access.html">access</a> to <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/computer_system.html">computer</a> systems for the purpose of stealing and corrupting <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/data.html">data</a>. Hackers, themselves, maintain that the proper term for such individuals is <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/h/crack.html">cracker</a>.</i></blockquote>

<BR><BR>A person that breaks into a computer system without authorization, whose purpose is to do damage (destroy files, steal credit card numbers, plant viruses, etc.). Because a cracker uses low-level hacker skills to do cracking, the terms "cracker" and "hacker" have become synonymous.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
