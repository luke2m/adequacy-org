		Relationships are becoming increasingly common across the internet in all their varied forms.  Tens of thousands of people are exploring online romances and millions more are forging friendships over the internet.  In our new digital age these online relationships could very well be the next logical step for humanity.  People have the opportunity to know all manner of folk they would never meet in their day to day life.  These online relationships often cross cultural, economical, national, age and societal boundaries in ways not even possible in the real world.  Aside from the occasional folly, certainly no one could argue that this new online social world will have anything but positive effects for those involved.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">When some single people are looking for a date, they go bar hopping.  Others participate in organized activities, like church functions, hoping to find that special someone to share their interests, and perhaps something more.  Still others simply spend time with their friends, hoping to meet the right person through a mutual friend.  There are countless ways to meet people when you're looking for a relationship.  It's just that some of them are safer and healthier than others.
<P>
This article warns you about one of the worst methods of finding a date, tailing the list just above kidnapping: online dating.  This article will inform you about the downfalls of online dating so readers can make the healthy decision to stay away from it. If you are a parent, it is doubly important that you read this article, so you are aware of what dangers await your children online and you can do whatever is necessary to protect them.
<P>
Whether an online relationship starts by chance or through ads placed on personal advertising services, when two people manage to "find someone" through the constant stream of pornography on the internet, the result is the same.  The relationship is always unhealthy for those involved.  Often, just the pursuit of a relationship online itself can even be dangerous!
<P>
If you've seen the average dating scene in our cities today, you are probably less than impressed with at least some of the people there.  I'm sure we're all aware of the sorts of losers that show up just about everywhere in today's society, even when they're not welcome.  But imagine: the internet dating scene is composed of <i>those who can not cut in in the real world dating scenes</i>.  The losers you see at the local bar are at least well adjusted enough to go look for partners in real life.  In contrast, the people who would look for love online are so far below the mark that they don't even bother showing up to traditional places where one can find a mate, because <i>they know it's hopeless</i>.  
<P>
Think!  You know what kind of people use the internet.  The internet is full of people who pay hundreds of dollars per month for high speed access to disgusting, degrading pornography sites!<P>
Simply put, if you're looking for love on the internet, you're clearly scraping the bottom of the barrel.  But it gets worse.  In real life, your body, through years of trial and error, has developed a defense system that is adept at judging the people you meet.  Your first impressions about people can speak volumes.  If you happen to run into a person who is dangerous, or just a little bit too weird, warning signs go off in your head and you quickly dismiss the person, as you should, and move along to find someone else who is hopefully a bit more normal.
<P>
However, when you are talking to people online <i>you have no way of telling what the person you are talking to is like</i>.  Without the ability to see someone, you can not properly judge them, and you never know what sort of person you are talking to until you make the dangerous step of meeting them in real life.  To exacerbate things, most people you talk to online are aware of this, and exploit it to their benefit.  Not only will they avoid speaking about their shortcomings, but they will often intentionally mislead you!  Without the audio and visual cues you rely upon, you are powerless to determine if the person you are talking to is an average homely nerd or some sort of pornography addicted homosexual rapist!  <P>
An added benefit to meeting people in real life is that the places you go determine the sort of people you will meet.  If you go to expensive clubs in nice parts of town, the people you see are forced to cross a kind of financial and social barrier to get in.  On the internet, you have no way of knowing if you've accidentally struck up conversation with someone who is <i>altogether different from you!</i>  If you're not careful, you could even be talking to a presbyterian and <i>not even realize it</i>.
<P>
As mentioned before, because of the wide availability of pornography on the internet, most people online are only there to get their rocks off.  While you or your child might become emotionally attached to the person on the other end of the wire, to them the relationship rarely means more than interactive pornography!  You or someone you know is just being used for some perverts masturbatory pleasure!
<P>
Obviously, online dating is unhealthy and dangerous.  If you value your life and your mental health, you must stay away from them.  If you value your friends and family, you must warn them about these "relationships."  And if you are a parent, you must monitor your children's online activities closely.  The "friendships" they are forming could quickly become something deadly.
<P>
Thank you.      <br><br></div>

She was indeed rather large - probably too large.  She was not ever going to be a skinny girl, but there was no need for her to be as large as she was.<BR><BR>
She probably would have been facially pretty, had hygene been a higher priority - she really needed to wash her hair - it looked downright nasty.<BR><BR>
Personality-wise, she was very nice, but way lacking in self-esteem.<BR><BR>
I actually tried to talk her out of it when I found out, but she was not about to budge.  I even tried to talk her out of it when she got in from her flight, but she was too far gone by that point... alas, it was not for the lack of effort on my part or another IRC user at the time, but we lost.  That was also the last time I ever used IRC... the events that transpired were just too pathetic to keep using it - especially knowing that this was not a unique situation... I had some chick ready to fly out to meet me (we played the Battletech 3051 MUSE together)... it took me quite a long time to convince her that I was indeed engaged and had a wedding date set.<BR><BR>
Anyway, so there you have it...<BR><BR><BR><i>I am not who you think I am.</i><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
fat chicks have nice hair.<BR>
<BR>
fat chicks can cook.<BR>
<BR>
fat chicks suck a mean dick (gobble if u prefer).<BR>
<BR>
fat chicks go out of their way to be nice.<BR>
<BR>
fat chicks do what they are told.<BR>
<BR>
fat chicks do not call the police.<BR>
<BR>
And of course, every fat chick has a skinny girl trapped inside her (with alot of choclate).<BR>
<BR>
Fat chicks are not to be reviled, they serve key roles in society, as illustrated above.<BR>
<BR>
On ugly chicks, please subsitute the word "fat" with "ugly" above.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks 4 ur time, and as grandpa was wont to say: blow me and don't tell mom.<BR>

Many of the male personnas were actually women tired of being accosted by perverts online.  These women were just your run-of-the-mill desperation cases

<BR><BR>The writer of this story is correct.  If they are online looking for romance, there is something wrong with them in a serious way.  Of course, many of the women I dated in real life were pretty messed up too, but not nearly to the extent that the online ones were.

<BR>
The author of this article makes it seem like everyone is on the Internet to look at porn...WRONG...I don't know where he/she got this from, but they don't know a clue about the Internet or online relationships.<BR>
<BR>
I DO KNOW! I met a man on the Internet 2 and a half years ago...and guess what...he is a very wonderful man...a true gentlemen and the love of my life. We now have a real life relationship...we spend time together atleast every other week...I just got back from spending 5 days with him and his mom...his mom loves me to death and thinks the world of me. He has been a dream come true and it all started on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
He wasn't looking at porn and neither was I....we are both Christians...we are just 2 people who love computers...he was coming off a bad relationship and was NOT looking for love and neither was I....we just met thru a random chat and started talking, became friends, and slowly, over time, we fell in love with each other. <BR>
<BR>
And there is nobody that can't say its not real...we ARE REAL....2 and a 1/2 years REAL. I am a part of his family and he's part of mine and we are looking to have a great future together. <BR>
<BR>
So to whoever wrote this article....ya need to wake up and grow up. Its people like you who give the Internet such a bad name and its people like me and my boyfriend who know the TRUTH and what joy and happiness can be found in the online world. <BR>
<BR>
There are many, many, many success stories and many people who have married their online love...and the numbers will only increase. <BR>
<BR>
So to anyone who reads this article...its a bunch of BS...the aurthor MAYBE had a point in trying to get people to be cautious...YES...you have to be cautious...BUT you have to be in any other relationship too...more so on the Internet...but that doesn't mean its a bad thing. The person who wrote this article sounds like someone who had a bad experience, probably because they didn't follow the guidelines of online dating and now wants to take it out on the whole interent....but they didn't do a very good job of it. <BR>
<BR>
And its very pathetic when the writer of an article is so wrapped up in tying everything with porn...makes me wonder of the writer himself has an addiction to porn. <BR>
<BR>
You have to be careful, take precautions...don't go looking for love in a sex chat if you want something more than a cheap good time....same thing as don't go to a strip joint if you want to find a faithful, loving spouse....use COMMON sense. And evidently whoever wrote this article doesn't have much comon sense or they wouldn't have written such a stupid, totally out of line, full of non-sense article.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry dude, but wake up...the Internet is the wave of the future and online relationships ARE a part of that.<BR>
<BR>
Whenever there is communication, there is a chance for friendship and love....<BR>
<BR>
I found TRUE LOVE on the INTERNET...so you can't tell me that it won't work....MINE DID work!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I will say this as my advice:<BR>
<BR>
If you go to a strip club, you're asking for trouble...if you go to a sex/porn site/chat, then you're asking for trouble.<BR>
<BR>
In internet love...use comon sense. Start out as friends...talk about any and everything...ask QUESTIONS and lots of them....save the conversations...if he's lying, it'll get harder and harder and you keep an eye out for anything that looks sucspcious. Find out a phone #, mailing address, and make sure they check out. Look for anything wierd...like if he only wants you to call at certain times or if he doesn't want you to call him at all. Find out where he works...Get a picture...to make sure its recent, if that's a concern, have them take a pic in front of a calender, new model car...or something that will let you date the picture. <BR>
<BR>
Get the phone # or e-mail of friends and family members...talk to them. Don't run an investigation, but this is all a part of getting to know them...in real life, you'd get to know their family...so why not online? Don't be like "hey, is your son a murderer?"...just get to know them like you'd do in real life. <BR>
<BR>
If you have any doubts, ask and find out. Be completely honest with the other person and if they are not being honest, you will probably soon to find out if you follow the precautions.<BR>
<BR>
Meet in person as soon as possible...make sure you feel comfortable and make sure its been long enough where you've got to know each other online. NEVER meet them alone...always meet in a public place and if possible, bring somone along. <BR>
<BR>
Its a good idea not to get too serious before you meet becauce sometimes things can change in real life...for the worse or for the better so its just good not to get too attached.<BR>
<BR>
Don't get too lost in the love until you know where the road is leading you...if there is a great distance involved, THINK about it BEFORE things get to serious. It HURTS like crazy if you fall in love and even meet and its all great....but one problem...neither of you can leave where you are at and the distance gets to be too much. Understand what you're getting into before you get into it. Distance is tough...make sure you BOTH can deal with it and are willing and make sure there is some way in the future down the line that you can be able to be together. <BR>
<BR>
Sadly, sometimes it just doesn't work out or very rarely, you do find someone who has lied and not been caught...well sadly that happens, but that's the risk you take...it doesn't happen often if you follow good advice...and the same thing can happen in real life...you can be fooled in real life.<BR>
<BR>
Internet relationships are like any other...some work and some don't, that's just how it goes. BUT they CAN work...me and my boyfriend are PROOF..2 and a 1/2 years and now in real life. <BR>
<BR>
That's my opinion...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Now, I'm not saying this because I can't get any in real life, because I can. I still live in the city I went to high school in, and just the other day at a  restaurant, one of my high school classmates waited on me. Jenni was quite the looker in high school, and though she's put on a few pounds, added some lines to her face, and has a hairstyle that belongs in the '80's, she's still a not bad looker. We talked a little about old times, and what we're doing now. She was full of complaints about her ex-husband who doesn't pay child support, and three bratty kids, and got really interested when I started talking about my new Ford Excursion (yeah, it hauls a lot of servers!) and my exciting job as an sa. She  even gave me her phone number, but she didn't have an email  addy, so I'm not too sure.
<BR><BR>
Anyhow, I've felt more real connections with people online, especially after a cyber, if you know what I mean, and once I get NetMeeting working with my ne USB -cam you can be sure I won't be fooled by guys anymore impersonating girls.<BR><BR><BR>gcc is to software freedom as guns are to personal freedom.<BR></FONT></td>

<br><br>
Why is this? Well because people know their station and know when people are out of their league. Ugly people marry ugly people. Well known fact.
<br><br>
Likewise, the type of trash that make use of internet dating are just aiming for someone who is on a par with them. Ugly people can meet ugly people in seedy bars. But where is a complete social reject to meet other likeminded rejects? By definition, they won't find them in a social setting. This is why the internet is perfect.
<br><br>
No only that, but by giving these freaks the net as an outlet, we reduce the chances of any of them wandering pathetically into our social circle.

So don't write off internet dating as completely evil. It has it's uses.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As a final note, I happen to disagree with about 90% of what you've written here, and I find it hard to even respect your viewpoint the way it is being presented.  Where are the verifiable facts?  I happen to know for a fact that at least some of the people who use the internet are not the ghastly uber-nerds you seem to think they are. Nearly all of my friends and family, people I see all the time and have known for years, spend at least some time on-line.  We often keep up with each other through ICQ and AIM, and I personally don't think that makes them bad people.  In fact, some of the most 'socially-acceptable' people I know spend quite a bit of time online, and I'm sure they're not out there hunting for porn.  <br>
Believe it or not, it actually is possible to find a normal, well-adjusted person online.  They aren't the dregs of the barrel, many of them are people who are simply tired of your 'glorious' bar scene, or people who aren't actively looking for a relationship.  I happen to know personally a few couples who have gotten together this way, one of which will be getting married next spring, and in none of these cases are either of them ugly hopeless losers.  <br><br>
After reading your article, I'm simply left wondering what kind of experience you've had that makes you think that online dating is simply a haven for pornography-loving, homosexual-rapist losers who can't cut it in the real world.  Care to elaborate?

Because of their low status on the social ladder, many of the people who would date on the internet will jump at the chance to drag an innocent, normal person into their seedy social environment.  Everyone finds those that are better than them attractive.

This means that nerdy, maladjusted teenagers would leap at the chance to trick innocent, nubile young women, perhaps even our daughters, into their depraved world of pornographic "relationships".

But then again, internet dating has one, that i see as readily apparent, benefit: It requires a certain old school courtship.<BR>
<BR>
When chatting online, or what have you -- though u might have a picture -- you are defined by your words. By the emotions and thoughts that you can express. Few argue that writing is harder than talking.<BR>
<BR>
So in that sense, you are getting to know people who are perhaps... more socially adjusted, as expressed through their communication skills.<BR>
<BR>
hmm...<BR>
<BR>
Everywhere there are losers, online and realtime, but the online medium does give an oportunity for real communication, to woo from a distance with no.... phyical incentivies or drawbacks. Certainly, this has the spice of romance to it.<BR>
<BR>
As far as pornography goes... what wrong with p0rn? you've lost me. It is a goodness to enjoy the flesh. And photos of it.<BR>

I know of too many friends and family who have met other people over the net. Most of them are now either married, living together, really best friends, or have kids together and now are a family. <BR>
And after hearing all this I have started to try online dating myself. And I must say it isn't all that bad. You get to meet tons of interesting people that you would never ever meet in your normal everyday life. I work a night shift and sometimes don't do much on the weekend but play online games. I do have friends that I goto bars with. So its not like I'm an anti-social person. I've tried to meet people at bars too. But that in my opinion is worse than online dating. 1. Because half the people you meet at bars are drunk anyways. 2. How much can you seriously get to know someone at a bar anyways?!? 3. Half the time people are only interested in looks. <BR>
Thats what I have found out anyways from the bar scene. When online dating you talk to that person for a month or so, sometimes less. You get to know that person inside out. Sometimes they lie to make them selfs sound better than what they really are. But in the end when you meet you will find all that out eventually. So most people don't bother lieing just for that reason. But don't get me wrong. There are wrong ways to go about online dating. It should never be rushed. And one should always avoid "purely sexual incounters". That could always lead out to be some big thug wanting to rape your A-hole. <BR>
All I'm really saying is that alot of what you said is BS and that online dating isn't for everyone. But for some of us its awesome. And there is nothing wrong with talking to someone for a long time. Swaping pictures. Then meeting at a public cafe to talk in person to see if you really connect. <BR>
Thats all I'm saying.<BR>

See, I have a g/f online right now, and we're really trying to make it work.  We're both 16 and trying to get our lisences.  She lives about 200 miles away, and so we can't see eachother until we do (get our lisences).  It's been a few months and we're really struggling to make it work... it's really hard to stay in contact over the net when you both have day to day lives to go on with.  We would call eachother, and do when we get phonecards, but that's rarely... I won't be able to see her for another 4 months, but your success story has given me a little bit more hope for our own success: Thanks.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
