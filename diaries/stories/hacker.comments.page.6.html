<BR>
First off, to get my credentials out of the way, I was a computer science major at Georgia Tech.  I'm sure a lot of paranoid naive people here will automatically label me as a "hacker," but I'll continue on anyway.
<BR>
A lot of people here have obviously not done any independent research on the topic and are just going on what they've heard from friends, neighbors, or worse yet, the media.  The lack of knowledge and the overuse of blanket statements in this discussion are honestly disturbing.  The statements made about AMD in the article were absolutely unbelievable.  Labelling tools such as Flash, multi-screen output and the like as tools for hackers is just insane.  Go to the office of a computer programmer who wrote your "family-friendly" AOL, Word, or Photoshop and take a look at their computer set-up.  Ignorance from the masses is what holds technology back.  Next time, before you "concerned parents" get all worked up over the next media label (this all reminds me of the Red Scare, "you have two monitors, you must be a hacker!") try and get some real information from all sides of the issue, it will save you a lot of trouble.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">'Hacking' has gotten a bad reputation. Note also that most of the people who call themselves Hackers don't know the first thing about it (these kinds of people are typically referred to as  "Script kiddies" by those in-the-know)
<BR>

<BR>
So just because you hear the work "hacker" is no reason to start burning people at the stake, sort of speak.
<BR>

<BR>
For the rest, I'll just go down the list of questions...
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? &lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
AOL is not the only ISP with child safety features. Also, there are stand-alone packages that do a much better job (I won't mention anything in particular, as I don't want to appear bias).
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps you should consider changing ISPs before your child even asks! AOL isn't exactly the best deal going... not by a long shot. There is a good chance that there is an ISP available in your area that is faster, easier, more secure 9in terms of your personal info) and cheaper!
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? &lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
"Comet Cursor" is a program that changes your mouse pointer from the default arrow to another graphic (usually animated). I fail to see how this is "hacker software" (Check the developer's website - www.cometsystems.com)
<BR>

<BR>
"Bonzi Buddy" (www.bonzi.com) is an internet browsing agent. It's a $40 piece of software last I checked... so if you did find it on your machine it's probably only a demo version. Again, there is nothing that could possible be considered "hacker" material associated with this commercial product.
<BR>

<BR>
"Flash" (www.macromedia.com) is THE premier software package for intereactive web content, made by one of the most widely known and respected multimedia software companies (right up there with Adobe). There are two parts... the player and the builder. Flash player is freely available as a browser plugin, While the full Macromedia Flash program is rather pricey (check website). There is absolutely NOTHING hacker-esque about this program.
<BR>

<BR>
The only point of concern is that since these are commercial software packages, obtaining full versions without paying for them IS illegal. In that case, I suggest you simply uninstall the offending software or buy it outright.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;3. Has your child asked for new hardware?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Faster video cards and increased memory do absolutely nothing for a 'hacker'. 
<BR>

<BR>
AMD, Advanced Micro Devices, inc. Their Athelon series processors are considered far better (better meaning they are faster while consuming less power) than Intel's P4 series. AMD is an ecellent, reliable processor manufacturer. If you're that worried about buying stuff that's made overseas, then maybe you should burn your kids' Nike shoes... (the kids who make those are literally held at gun point)
<BR>

<BR>
Also, there is no such thing as "Anti-hacker" features in processor chips.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;4. Does your child read hacking manuals?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
There is no such thing as a "Hacking manual" available in bookstores. Books about hackers do not contain any pertinent information about HOW to actually 'hack'. (If you even know what that is, which I don't think you do...) "Programming with Perl" is not hacking related. Perl is a very popular and widely supported Server-side scipting language commonly used for e-business 'shopping carts' and forums/messageboards. I wouldn't be surprized if this list was powered by a Perl script!
<BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, maybe you should ENCOURAGE your kid to learn to program. Perl programmers can make up to $50,000 a year to start...
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Internet/computer addiction is a completely different topic... but you don't seem to be talking about that anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
DOS (Denial Of Service) attacks have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the DOS (Disk Operating System) command prompt. It does, however, involve eating up the target's bandwidth, and it technically is against the law. (at least you got that right...)
<BR>

<BR>
Limiting unsupervized access to the internet Is a good thing, but not because your kid is trying to 'hack' someone... it's just not a very healthy thing to sit around all day. (Physically, socially and mentally)
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;6. Does your son use Quake?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
QUAKE is a very popular videogame. It has absolutely nothing to do with hackers, save for the occasional group of hackers (and in this case I use the term correctly) who modify the game's programming code (which is legal, and the code is freely available from the company who developed the game) in order to make a new game out of it, or make modifications.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
This is more likely a result of puberty than of 'hacking'. Teenagers are simply jerks sometimes, and they seldom like talking to their parents about their personal lives. (And don't give me any of that "not my kid" crap either... just remember the secrets you kept from YOUR parents.) If your kid is spending more than three &lt;b&gt;hours&lt;/b&gt; a day in front of the PC, then you might consider that he's just not getting out enough.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
It's spelled "Linux". Linux is a free, command-line based operating system renound for it's security, stability and it's revolutionary "open source" style development technique. (Maybe you should actually read ""The Cathedral
<BR>
  and the Bazaar" before you burn it). It's found a very secure nitche in the business world as a reliable, stable server platform. It's a serious rival to Microsoft's NT system.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;9. Has your son radically changed his appearance?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Again, maybe he's just being the typical, sexually frustrated prepubesent teenager. Kackers don't have a universal dress code that I know of.. and what you describe sounds more like a punk rocker type apparel than a computer geek.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;b&gt;10. Is your son struggling academically?&lt;/b&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
This might actually be a computer-usage related problem. it has been proven, however, that students who use the Internet for academic purposes (such as seeking extra help on topics, or for researching for school reports/projects) show a significant improvement in their grades, while those who spend their time in generic chatrooms (and, oddly enough, Instant Messaging conversations) show a marked decrease in performance. Then again, amybe your kid was just dumb to begin with, and now he's finally found something he's interested in and could be potentially good at (and make a good career with) only to find that you're doing everything in your power to repress him... no wonder he won't talk to you anymore.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Please forgive me if any of the above came off as exceptionally sarcastic, but if you really were a GOOD parent, you would do your homework and learn exactly what 'hacking' is, what is involved, and a little more about what your kid ACTUALLY does with his PC time rather than jumping to conclusions.
<BR>

<BR>
My advice to anyone reading this page is to completely ignore the whole thing and go discover the facts for yourself!

If u check it out, hackers are people extremely skilled in the languages of Computers, another words, they help businesses/companies/non profit organizations, such as napster.  they needed beta testers, a.k.a. "hackers", to make it run properly.  Look at blizzard, don't u see all the help signs that are posted for beta testers?  just to tell u sir, I think u may have misjudged ur son.  Also, I would extremely like a NEW VIDEO CARD, seeing that (computer games such as), QUAKE and another GREAT SHOOTING GAME, COUNTER-STRIKE, run slowly due to all the action.  and one more thing, linux servers are the best, many gaming servers use this type (especially low budget ones).  Yes, have u put in consideration that the Linux preferences conflict with ur proccessing cards?  and if u seriously knew much about computers, u should seriously reconsider banning ur son from ur computer.  And female "hackers" are hot!  too bad there's only 1 in U of A (faculty of computer sciences...)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
AMD is not an inferior processor that knocks off Intel chips. They are a legitimate company making a product that competes against Intel and is doing fairly well. Their processors are MUCH cheaper than Intel's and they perform at or above Intel's level. 
<BR>
The CPU has nothing to do with hacking per se. Of course it is the vehicle that is used but it in NO WAY "allows" hacking. AMD chips are able to be "over-clocked" which allows them to go faster than they were designed to go. This just enhances gaming or whatever you are doing without buying a faster chip.
<BR>
Every other question that is answered seems to be from parents that have teenagers. These are things that teenagers do. Because they are into computers doesn't mean anything except that they are into computers.
<BR>
As for Quake, you can't be serious. It is a game. I have watched my son play it for years now. As a matter of fact it is old now. There are better games out now. Notice I said game. It is a game that kids and adults play. It is more fun online because you can play against other real people instead of a computer that can easily be beat. You really believe it is a training ground? Let's jump to conclusions a little more... Kids that spend a lot of time in the library are learning to build atom bombs. Come on.
<BR>
You are doing your readers a disservice by posting this propaganda. You obviously haven't researched any of your statements one bit. Not one has anything more than a shread of truth beyond the "I heard it from... and he/she says it's true..." You sound like all the women I am forced to listen to when I go to pick up my son from boy scouts.

You shouldn't be upset over this. Granted he may have been spending too much time on the internet as many people with interests in science fiction, anime and gaming tend to do at times, but none of the information you have provided in the article above pertains to hacking. In fact, it almost sounds as if your son wants to become a computer programer. 
<BR>

<BR>
If I were you, I'd be more worried about your sons antisocial behavior, failing grades and odd responses to visual stimuli. The internet doesn't usually breed this, but problems off the computer do. I don't think I need to mention what those are, either.

This article must be a joke, and a good one at that. :)  I find it rather funny that this guy thinks that his son is hacking when the kid doesn't even have a language that he can write programs in!  I mean, seriously, there is no 'click here to hack webpage and fuck someone up' button.  Also, about Quake.  That's a f-ing game!  And in fact, I do have many hacks for that game, especially the one's that are sponsered by the game company that made Quake.  They didn't lock the guy who came up with the first hack for Quake because it wasn't illegal.  If you want to know what they did, they gave him a job and recognized his true talent!  You people are wakko.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">"As an enlightened, modern parent, I try to be as involved as possible in the lives of my six children. I encourage them to join team sports. I attend their teen parties with them to ensure no drinking or alcohol is on the premises. I keep a fatherly eye on the CDs they listen to and the shows they watch, the company they keep and the books they read. You could say I'm a model parent. My children have never failed to make me proud, and I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest family in the USA."
<BR>

<BR>
So basically you are not allowing your kids to have a free mind of their own? And you are not modern OR enlightened at all.
<BR>

<BR>
"Two years ago, my wife Carol and I decided that our children's education would not be complete without some grounding in modern computers. To this end, we bought our children a brand new Compaq to learn with. The kids had a lot of fun using the handful of application programs we'd bought, such as Adobe's Photoshop and Microsoft's Word, and my wife and I were pleased that our gift was received so well. Our son Peter was most entranced by the device, and became quite a pro at surfing the net. When Peter began to spend whole days on the machine, I became concerned, but Carol advised me to calm down, and that it was only a passing phase. I was content to bow to her experience as a mother, until our youngest daughter, Cindy, charged into the living room one night to blurt out that "Peter is a computer hacker!"   "
<BR>

<BR>
So what if he spends whole days on the machine?  You bought it for educational purposes, and hes educating himself and culturizing himself to things online.  He may one day turn it into a career.  For example, I for one and going to be a computer programmer and am going to probably design games.
<BR>
 
<BR>

<BR>
 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"As you can imagine, I was amazed. A computer hacker in my own house! I began to monitor my son's habits, to make certain that Cindy wasn't just telling stories, as she is prone to doing at times. "
<BR>

<BR>
Well good for you.  You have a child that is curious, and you cant believe it.
<BR>

<BR>
"After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking, I confronted Peter with the evidence. I'm afraid to say, this was the only time I have ever been truly disappointed in one of my children. We raised them to be honest and to have integrity, and Peter betrayed the principles we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities. His denials continued for hours, and in the end, I was left with no choice but to ban him from using the computer until he is old enough to be responsible for his actions. "
<BR>

<BR>
Guess what? I know right from wrong.  I spend a lot of my time on the computer.  Might I add that I am a straight A student, one of the top in my graduating class, and I can probably enter college as a sophomore?
<BR>

<BR>
"After going through this ordeal with my own family, I was left pondering how I could best help others in similar situations. I'd gained a lot of knowledge over those few days regarding hackers. It's only right that I provide that information to other parents, in the hope that they will be able to tell if their children are being drawn into the world of hacking. Perhaps other parents will be able to steer their sons back onto the straight and narrow before extreme measures need to be employed."
<BR>

<BR>
Where did you get your information?  Im telling you, about 99.9999% of your information is biased and incorrect.
<BR>

<BR>
"To this end, I have decided to publish the top ten signs that your son is a hacker. I advise any parents to read this list carefully and if their son matches the profile, they should take action. A smart parent will first try to reason with their son, before resorting to groundings, or even spanking. I pride myself that I have never had to spank a child, and I hope this guide will help other parents to put a halt to their son's misbehaviour before a spanking becomes necessary."
<BR>

<BR>
"smart" parent....ha ha ha ha ha
<BR>

<BR>
"1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider."
<BR>

<BR>
This should be reworded to "Most American families use trusted responsible Internet Service providers because they are popular and all they want to do is jump on the Bandwagon."  Also, kids may just want faster internet to reduce lag when they play games online, etc.  That is why I asked my parents for Road Runner cable so that I could play games faster.
<BR>

<BR>
"I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants their son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites."
<BR>

<BR>
Guess what?  My parents never used filters for my internet.  Also guess what?  I am a college-bound 17 year old who is one of the top in my class at school.  Also guess what? I use a computer.
<BR>

<BR>
"2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". "
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is a cursor program.  It changes the look of your cursor much like you would choose a new look for your desktop.  I dont know about Bonzi Buddy, but Flash is a computer animation program used by people to create interactive online movies for entertainment.
<BR>

<BR>
"The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding."
<BR>

<BR>
What evidence?  You have absolutely no true and factual evidence.
<BR>

<BR>
"3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer."
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe he just wants games to run faster?  Maybe the computer cant run photoshop too well or is very very slow at copying files?
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well."
<BR>

<BR>
!!!! This one seriously makes me angry.  I am an avid user of 2 AMD processors. Yes, they are in stores, goto your local best buy and look for them, they are there.  THey are also sold on laptops.  And they are an AMERICAN COMPANY!! Where are you getting your information!?!?!? Also guess what?  NO PROCESSOR HAS "ANTI-HACKING" MEASURES.  IT CAN BE DONE ANYWHERE!
<BR>

<BR>
"4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds."
<BR>

<BR>
This I have no clue about since I am not a hacker.  But judging from your information so far, this is probably wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
"There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond. "
<BR>

<BR>
no comment
<BR>

<BR>
"If you find any of these hacking manuals in your child's possession, confiscate them immediately. You should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves. You may meet with some resistance at first, but even booksellers have to bow to community pressure. "
<BR>

<BR>
no comment
<BR>

<BR>
"5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day."
<BR>

<BR>
Oh please.  I spend an average of about 5 hours a day on the computer. Want to know what I do?  I type school reports, read forums and articles (especially this one), I play games, and converse with good friends online.
<BR>

<BR>
"6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school."
<BR>

<BR>
Train in the use of various firearms.  Give me a break.  THey are using a mouse and a cursor on a screen.  If anything, you are training also because they are doing what you do when you are on the computer, POINT AND CLICK!  Also, I have played quake...it is not a "breeding" ground  it is a ground to let loose and have fun fragging with friends.  Also guess what? I am not anti-social and I am a straight A student.
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school. "
<BR>

<BR>
If your son cannot separate reality from the fantasy world of quake, then I would question your parenting skills up to the point that allowed them to become this way.
<BR>

<BR>
"7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature."
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe hes arguing with you because he can blatantly see that you are extremely ignorant.  Also, keep in mind I am a teenager who is uses the computer a lot and can tell right from wrong and IS A STRAIGHT A STUDENT.
<BR>

<BR>
"Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in. Keep trying to get through to him, no matter how much he retreats into himself. "
<BR>

<BR>
You are smothering him.  You are preaching him that computers are evil and that they should burn with satan.  Hes probably arguing because he knows the truth and you dont.  But since you are the parent, you have the right to say you are right and he is wrong.  God I wish there were more parents like mine in the world.
<BR>

<BR>
"8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone."
<BR>

<BR>
oh my god.  First of all, it is LINUX.  Second, Linus Torvalds wrote the base kernel for LINUX as an alternative to having to pay hundreds of dollars for a Microsoft-dominated product.  It is free code and is distributed freely in the public domain so that people can modify it and fit it to their needs.  It is usualy used to run gaming servers, web servers, etc.  And guess what, mp3s originated under windows-based terms...oh no, you have a windows pc, you better get rid of it.
<BR>

<BR>
"Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional."
<BR>

<BR>
Deleting windows is not breaking a computer completely.  I would advise you to go read a manual on installing Windows or basically installing computers and building computers period.  Obviously, you have no idea about computers whatsoever.
<BR>

<BR>
"If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface."
<BR>

<BR>
LILO is the bootstrap program that helps to load the Linux OS.  Thats just what Linux is.  An OS.  Just like Windows is an OS.  Please go find some factual information before I puke.
<BR>

<BR>
"9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences."
<BR>

<BR>
Do not judge a person on how they dress.  I do not dress like the aformentioned, and I am an avid computer user.  I wear plain old shirts and plain old shorts to school.  I dont have spiky hair (I dont even comb it, I like the natural look).  This is a stereotype dress, and is not limited to "hackers".  Appearance isnt everything.
<BR>

<BR>
"10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases. Also, the reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight. For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically."
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, as I have mentioned many times, I am a straight A student.  I am also a drummer.  I have strong arms from this.  I get straight A's in school and I am taking COLLEGE LEVEL CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL!
<BR>

<BR>
"I encourage all parents to read through this guide carefully. Your child's future may depend upon it. Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison, and tear your family apart. It cannot be taken too seriously."
<BR>

<BR>
Please, find some better information and please educate yourself.  I have not found one single factual piece of evidence in this article yet.  Maybe your son has a greater mind than you do my friend.  Sit and listen to him for awhile, maybe you will learn something.  I cant believe what parenting is coming to in the United States.  You really need to meet my parents my friend.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

o, and why do people alwys think of a hacker as a person who uses his skills wit a computer to tak advantage of helpless ignorant idiots like whoever the hell posted that totally stupid and useless waste of hardriuve space on this site. hackers can be anyone who likes computers enough to take the time and commitment to learn a coding language like c++ or perl.
<BR>
people who use what they learn for nothing but cracking into other peoples sites are usually refered to as crackers by real hackers.
<BR>
and girls are justas good as boys if they want to be, its just that many dont really care about it.
<BR>
i think most of the idiot shithead mistakes that this loser made have already been mentioned ( like comet cursor, a hacking tool? AMD? puleeeze..) but still i can see hackers and crackes alike laughing there heads off at this fuck head (shit head, fuck head, is there a difference? does anyone really care?) and feeling pity for the poor kid who has such a *ahem protective fuckhead-for-a-dad.
<BR>

<BR>
ps: i have nothig against crackers and what they do, i have done some crakcing myself, fun shit i say... just dont do anythin naughty =)...

linux for hackers, by hackers

mmmmmm, quake... counterstike...

what kinda cr_p is this? I thought all that junk they put out in those TV specials about some fat, balding high school dropout who does a report on hacking and thinks everything not having to do with AOL is satantic were just madeup so the guy would get a paycheck. you got issues buddy. first off, it takes a degree of intelligence to hack, or even use a computer program OUTSIDE OF AOL. obviously, you lack all of these skills. which means you should actually congratulate your son for succeeding where the rest of the family will always fail: turning on the computer. if your son wants to switch ISPs, maybe it's 'cause AOL SUCKS. he wants a new hard drive, maybe it's cause IT"S TOO SMALL. since when is it a sin to ask for a new graphix card? it's ppl like you that make me laugh out loud for about 10 min. thx:)

If it wasn't for the so called hackers..the humanity wouldn't be so advanced.. in terms of tech. If you don't it this way.. let me put you in other words..About 20-30 years ago the first computer game appeared(Not talking about IBM PC compatible or Macs) the game was said to be an "improper and malicious use of software"! If it should've been so.. we would all be doomed. THis is only an example, there are many more!

For the author: Linux is a what?? Wanna be OS?? LOL!! Spare me!!! Linux became an OS even before Windows(Only became a real OS in 2K Pro and Xp). Windows is a graphic application(Like KDE for Linux) that would be run in DOS(Like a Linux Shell) and if Windows 3.11 to NT 4 are OS so are KDE, Gnome, Enligthement and a few other..
<BR>

<BR>
For all PC users: If you want safety get a Linux Distribution(Red Hat, Debian, Corel, SuSe, Slackware) for free and learn it. The excuse for having to pay to maintain you PC will disappear, because Linux is free! And a "good" Windows like 2K pro or Xp Pro will cost you top bucks. Yes, you can copy Windows..but that's illegal..but in those cases you don't hate Hackers, crackers and alike, do you???

If your child (you the author) is a hacker, you should feel blessed, as that family member obviously has some intelligence, of which you and your wife are severly lacking. For your information, the widest and most used systems hackers do use are Intel CPU based with a Microsoft OS, because both Intel and Microsoft are practically monopolies, NEITHER of them or any hardware/software manufacturer can make a "hacker-proof" ANYTHING. Do yourself a favor and get an education, obviously YOUR parents have failed you there, and your ignorance is failing your children as well, don't state your an American because it's plain embarassing.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If this is a serious post, then this is my counter arguement to the ignorant post.
<BR>

<BR>
1) Your son has asked to switch ISP's
<BR>
- if you are using AOL, and your son or daughter ask to change ISP's, its because AOL is a very slow internet provider. A faster provider means more that you can do within a set amount of time.
<BR>

<BR>
2) You find programs on your computer that you do not remember installing.
<BR>
- it could be that your kids have their own money and went out and bought whatever game or program they wanted. or it could be that they downloaded some desktop accessories etc.
<BR>
Flash, Comet Cursor and Bonzai Buddy are accessories. not hacking software. if you research more you would know that.
<BR>

<BR>
3) Your child asks for hardware upgrades
<BR>
- hardware upgrades are nessessary to keep up with current computer gaming and/or graphic design. more memory is used for multiple purposes.
<BR>

<BR>
4) Your child reads hacking manuals
<BR>
- the books you have listed are programming manuals. programming is a profitable field in recent years. microsoft has hundreds if not thousands of programmers to create their software
<BR>

<BR>
5) Your child spends more than 30 min on the computer a day.
<BR>
- 30 min. is not adequate time for someone to enjoy the internet experience.
<BR>

<BR>
6) Your child plays Quake
<BR>
- Quake is a popular first person shooting game. Much like Nintendo 64's Goldeneye 007. Except it has internet capability so they can play with an infinite number of people.
<BR>

<BR>
7) Your child has developed a bad attitude toward you and others.
<BR>
- This is a few possible things. but hacking is not a cause of bad attitudes. He could be on drugs. he could be an alcholic. he could be hanging out with the wrong people. he could be watching too much Jerry Springer. or it could be that your parenting skills are poor.
<BR>

<BR>
8) Your child is obsessed with Lunix.
<BR>
- Unix, Linux, and Lunix are alternatives to Microsoft Windows. Telnet is a networking program used by many colleges to connect computers together.
<BR>

<BR>
9) Your child dresses differently
<BR>
- Baggy pants and bright colored clothing are instyle at the moment. if you open up any fashion magazine, watch a modern movie, or even step outside for a minute you will notice that. Glowsticks are rave accessories. a "rave" is a dance with electronic music. glowsticks do not signify hacking. they are used for rave style dancing. because the atmosphere at a rave dance is dark, the glowsticks are highly visible and leave streaks of light when waved around. pacifiers are also a rave accessory. but if your son/daughter is carrying one of these around, you might have something to worry about. Ravers who take a drug known as "extasy" (a.k.a. X or XTC), the scientific name is "methylenedioxymethamphetamine", are known to feel the need to chew and/or eat things while under the influence of the drug. even if they are not hungry. Ravers have been known to bite their tongues and draw blood while taking extasy. the pacifier was the solution.
<BR>

<BR>
10) Your son is struggling academically
<BR>
- most hackers do good in school. especially math and computer courses. if your son is doing bad in school, it could be a number of reasons. he could be hanging out with the wrong crowd, he could be under the influence of drugs or alchohol, he could be in classes that are too difficult for him. if your son is struggling in athletics, it might be because he does not enjoy them or is not physically fit to participate in them. and computers do not emit "radiation." if you are afraid of radiation, then throw your microwave away. it radiates your food.
<BR>

<BR>
11) Your child listens to Electronic Music. that's a personal prefferance. actually, most movie sound tracks are electronically recorded. Its just music created through new media. just like if you choose to listen to jazz and your best friend listens to rock and roll. it's a personal preferance thing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">All right, all right, I understand that you are trying to protect your son.  But I have a few comments on your article.  
<BR>

<BR>
First, there are other internet services that have better parental control programs than AOL, if your son was really a hacker he would've easily gotten around AOL's (which is fairly easy to circumvent I've heard).
<BR>

<BR>
About the new programs installed on the computer, have you asked your son or any of your other children what these are?  If not, I'll tell you what the ones you've mentioned are.  Comet Cursor is an annoying program that blurs your mouse cursor, Bonzi Buddy is a stupid monkey program that sits on your desktop and says random things, and Flash is a program used to create animation (cartoons).  Most of these are downloaded by accident when viewing a website, while you must buy Flash, which is a very high-end program used by such corporations as Disney that costs about $50.
<BR>

<BR>
Moving on, you mentioned AMD as "a third-world based company", when it is acutally an American company based in the Southwest.  It is about the ONLY competitor to Intel, and some of its processors are superior to Intel's Pentium series.  Also, if your son asks for new hardware, it is most likely because he wants to keep up with his friends, since a computer is obsolete six months after purchase.  Unless you upgrade every six months at least, you will fall behind and be forced to buy a new computer later on to be able to run more advanced versions of Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop.
<BR>

<BR>
Next, you mention "hacking manuals".  While I haven't read any of the books you have mentioned, I know for a fact that most of them are NOVELS about Government ANTI-HACKER UNITS.  The exception is "Programming with Perl", which is a guide to writing in the programming language "PERL", which is used to make video games and other programs.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, you next mention something called "DOSing".  I don't know if you realize this, but "DOS" means "Direct Operating System", as in "MS-DOS", which runs the computer underneath Windows.  There is no such thing as "DOSing" to my knowledge, and if you see your son in DOS Prompt, he is more than likely accessing a video game that can only be run in "MS-DOS".
<BR>

<BR>
About how long he is on the computer, I understand that you have your rules on computer use.  But please understand, usually you can't do much of anything in only thirty minutes.  Please consider increasing the time to at least one hour, I can't even type up this response in thirty minutes.
<BR>

<BR>
Moving on, I will now explain what "Quake" is to you.  "Quake" is not a virtual reality, is in a violent computer game rated "M" for ages 18 and above.  Now I will not go into a long speech on why Columbine happened (which is, I assume, the reason you believe it is necessary to contact the school), but I will say that unless your son has some sort of mental defect that disables the ability to tell the difference between reality and fantasy, there shouldn't be any problem.
<BR>

<BR>
I must say I disagree with your view on when a child is most impressionable.  I believe that age is from 1 year to about 9 years old.  By the time a child is 15 years old, they should've matured enough to understand the concepts of right and wrong and tell the difference between real and not real.  I'd actually say that your teen years are your LEAST impressionable as a child, only their peers could have any effect on their behavior.
<BR>

<BR>
As we move on, you mention that hacking will cause a child to become "argumentive and surly".  I believe you are confusing hacking, which would lead to the child separating him or herself from society, with normal teenage puberty.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, now I must clear up everything about the so-called hacking program "Lunix".  First off, you misspelled the word, it is correctly spelled "Linix".  After this, EVERYTHING is wrong.  Linix was created by Linus Torvalds, an American, as an alternative Operating System to Windows for Professional Computer Programmers.  It has nothing to do with hacking, it is just another Operating System, like Windows 95 or Mac OS 10.
<BR>

<BR>
"Telnet" is short for "Tele-Network", which is a legitimate and LEGAL device for not using a telephone line to connect to the internet.  The same with Cable Modems, which are 10 times faster than normal Modems, and I recommend everyone to use.
<BR>

<BR>
"MP3" is just a music file with CD quality sound, it also has nothing to do with hacking.  The reason MP3s have been in the news lately because certain individuals have illegally copying musics from CDs into MP3s and selling them.  Unless your son is selling bootleg CDs, I don't think there is a problem with them.
<BR>

<BR>
Moving on, you say that there are many hackers in schools today.  I dissagree from experience, I go to an average size school and there are only two hackers out of about a thousand.  Trust me, hackers aren't as common as you have been lead to believe, I read in TIME magazine that there are only a few hundred hackers in existance around the world, easily less than 1,000.
<BR>

<BR>
Next, you mentioned the "Otaku Hacking Association".  Unsure of myself, I did a search on several different search engines and found nothing on this supposed organization.  I know for a fact that the word "Otaku" has nothing to do with hacking, it means "fan" in Japanese.  I know because I speak Japanese.  Anyone can be an "Otaku", you could be a "Baseball Otaku" (Baseball Fan) for example.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, you messed up when you were listing mental diseases.  Meningitis is NOT a mental disease, it is a disease of the mouth that causes damage to your gums.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally, you say that excessive computer use will lower your child's academic scores, this is just plain wrong.  I am usually on the computer for seven hours daily, yet I am an Honor Roll straight A student.  So are all my friends who do the same.  Are we anamolies?  I think not, if anything excessive computer use has INCREASED my overall grade 20%.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope I have clarified the mistakes you have made and will quickly revise your article to address these mistakes.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyone with the least bit of expertise would know that. How can you even attempt to stereotype the typical "hacker." YOU IDIOT, hackers can range from being a four-foot-tall female freshman to a well-dressed 6-foot male. As for the pacifiers, that has to do with RAVERS, not HACKERS. I basically fit your description of a hacker, and let me tell you that I am putting my computer knowledge to good use. Teenagers that are Linux savvy can get paid up to $200 and hour PROTECTING AGAINST HACKERS. I find your ingnorance truly APPALING.

If your child is wearing "bagy pants and bright colored t-shirts" be sure to confinscate. Because if this is not done your child may just have what is left of apersonality. As for your son carrying around glow sticks and wearing pacifiers...either ya kid is a flaming homo (the more likley option) or he is going to "raves" and "droping eX"  =) I sugjest speaking to a school counseler about this subject because they really know whats going on don't they? (bye the way pacifiers are used for not griding your teeth while on ectasy and glow sticks are for giving light shows to "trip people out")

<BR>

<BR>
1 - You are on a dialup are'nt you? This is taboo for people to play games, mainly FPS (First person shooters) and real-time strategy games, he who has the ping *owns the game* (another term for winning). I suggest a Static DSL line. It is safe and fairly quick, get the 768Mbps line, about $40/month now if interested. Cable modems are nice also, quicker than DSL one on one and have firewalls to help keep hackers out but then again, if someone is trying to hack the PC at your house you have pissed them off and they are looking to wipe your BIOS out or something funky like that.
<BR>

<BR>
2 - Hackers would'nt even bother with hacking a game, there is no reward and it is too easy, trust me on this one Mack. Hackers target small business' or relitvely unknown banking systems with primitive Bots or none at all. you'll have to trust me here also =) &lt;---Smiley face for the unknowing. The reward in hacking a system is not getting caught, like as a kid when you stole a piece of candy from the store, remember? Yes the better hackers do try the bigger fish and whatnot. A child's (Cindy) version of Hacking and my version of hacking differ greatly, by the way, do you want free Cable and Electricity? That is first grade hacking and a joke, settle down =)
<BR>

<BR>
3 - AMD makes a mighty fine processor, they were putting out 500MHz CPUs when Pentium fronted the 266, I have an AMD myself, 800MHz to be precise along with several other CPUS in other systems.
<BR>

<BR>
4 - The video card is helpful in the games he plays, it gives the gamer a quiker fps (frames per second) and allows him to see objectives more clearly. Get him a Geforce 3 64Mb card, or at least a GeForce 2 64Mb card, don't have to spend a fortune, he is a kid and enjoys having a good gaming experience...let him have it d00d.
<BR>

<BR>
5 - As a child we have always marveled and admired the best kickball player, or marble shooter, or basketball player, or football player...it is the same with these games, the good players are honored and revered, just not in the conventional method that we are used to as adults (I simply refuse to grow up myself). I play these games, not Quake but Tribes 2 and Counter-Strike...Quake is too easy and too cheesy for me, pffttt!!!
<BR>

<BR>
6 - Linux (Redhat among other versions) is simply the finest OS for hosting games with. Very clean, and you can get some versions free. I have'nt found a practical use for it myself, I stick to Windows (So shoot me already!)
<BR>

<BR>
In closing, I would like to remind the others who so rudly commented on this fathers post to remember that we all once were computer illiterate, every one of us. He just needed to be educated on the matter, and there are a plethora of individuals more qualified than I (yes, women included) to explain this, I do try to help though.
<BR>

<BR>
If your son leaves the PC on all night and there is activity within the PC, then maybe, just maybe (.1% chance) he is port surfing otherwise he is downloading some MP3 or a game demo. My suggestion to you is to unground him from the computer, get into what he does (gently) play a game with him, let him show you what he does. Any other questions post them here and I'll try to help =)  &lt;---another smiley face if you forgot what that was.

Comet Cursor and Bonzai Buddy as hacker software?? please, my mother has that shit installed on her computer cause she installed the stupid Gator.com thing. Does that make her a hacker?? hardly, shes practically computer illiterate.
<BR>

<BR>
as for the ISP/Hardware thing. ANY AVID GAMER WILL DO THAT.... I, myself, am a very avid gamer, and im always wanting to improve my computer, internet connection, or anything else that i can do to get an upper edge over the competition. 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake...being a hacker gathering place?? while, i do admit to the validity of this statement, nobody ever states it out loud for the simple fact that your IP address is available for anybody to see at anytime that your playing. As for the training in firearms?? riiiiight, pushing a mouse button or the alt button is really gonna teach a child how to handle the kick back of a 9mm Baretta or how to properly hold a .22 sniper rifle to thier shoulder.   
<BR>

<BR>
as for the appearance thing??  man, i went through so many phases back in school it was hard to figure out what the fuck i was trying to be, one year i was a skinhead who was into self mutilation, next i was a bodyboarder, next i was a goth, next i was into country....I changed my appearance more times then youve probably got brain cells. 
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, i admit to the Lunix/Linux/Unix type software being a hackers dream OS. But this is because of the freedom that it provides. And no, you dont have to send the computer back to the manufacturer to get it removed, ya fuckin moron
<BR>

<BR>
Kids being argumentative and surely???  How many parents out there today can easily say that thier kids are like that???  this is the new millenium....you fuckin twit...its an everyday occurance for a child, especially a teen, to have some type of dispute with thier family...it's the defiance of authority.
<BR>

<BR>
And if your child is struggling acedemically...dude...somethings wrong with yer kid then, and it aint hackin. I have been working around and with computers since i was 5 years old. Back when the best computer you could buy was a 256Mhz with a 30 MB hard drive that cost 500 dollars(the hard drive, not the computer). I neither dropped academically, nor did i falter in sports. I was the star QB for the local Pee Wee association football league, and in the off season of that, i was the leading pitcher for little league. Made all stars 4 years in a row on both teams.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
You are a fucking idiot, with his head stuck so far up his ass he can see out his mouth. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you wish to know what a real hacker is, ill be happy to let some of my net friends know about this little post of yours and have a blast on your computer.
<BR>

<BR>
ta for now, ya dumbshit

<BR>

<BR>
I'm having a hard time picturing the author as actually believing what is stated in the article. It's obviously ironic and intended for laughs, wether it be the laughs of the readers or the author himself. And the response from another member@adecuacy.org, referring to the "Underground Sex Chart?" Hahaha... Is this just an alias used by the author?
<BR>

<BR>
On the other hand the reference to religion (in this case christianity) rings a bell of warning in the back of my head. I have to admit I have only limited first hand experience with the extensive narrow-mindedness some christians suffer from but that's enough for me to wonder if this article might not be genuine after all.
<BR>

<BR>
Should the author be honest in his attempt articulate the symptoms of a hacker becoming, well, then it can only be summarized as "a lousy researched article imbued with religious intolerance."
<BR>

<BR>
Anyways, my friends and I got quite a few laughs out of reading this, and, NO! We're NOT hackers. On the contrary many of us work with protecting systems from them. In this profession it's equally important to know the MO of hackers.

That article was obviously written by a parent who hasn't a clue about computers or technology in general.  Associating a game and/or dress with a particular group of people is just as discriminatory as racism.  There are perfectly good people in the world with play Quake as purely a means of recreation and know that it is completely fictional.  There are also perfectly good people out there who dress with "baggy clothes" and "day-glo" colors.  And might I ask what exactly is wrong with asking for new hardware?  Doesn't everyone want to have the best they can?  I'm sure your son is more up to date on today's new technology than you ever will be.  And again, there is nothing wrong with asking to change ISPs.....especially if it means switching from a dial-up connection to a cable modem or xDSL.  Again, this point has no grounds for 99% of the people in the world.  Next question: Do you even have a clue what Macromedia Flash is?  Maybe you should do a little more research before you open your big mouth.  Flash is one of the most powerful tools for web dev since the beginning of HTML.  Flash a hacker tool?  I don't think so.  Furthermore, Bonzi Buddy is often bundled with other perfectly benign software downloaded from the web.  The author if this article obviously did not do their homework before deciding to make themselves an authority on such a matter.  Just remember, it is better to be silent and let other think you are a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I (As an IT Professional in the field for 9
<BR>
years) see this as a poor attempt by a concerned
<BR>
parent to understand computers. I especially
<BR>
enjoyed the part about "Linux, the evil hacking
<BR>
tool" &lt;slight chuckle&gt;. Did you know that Linux
<BR>
is a popular platform used in many companies?
<BR>
The Dow Chemical Co. and Saginaw Valley State
<BR>
University (As well as many others around the
<BR>
great State of Michigan) use Linux. Does this
<BR>
make these institutions "hacker organizations?"
<BR>
I doubt it.
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly, a point about Linux, it can be removed
<BR>
by anyone who is brighter than a 1 watt Christmas
<BR>
tree bulb by running the Microsoft DOS Utility
<BR>
called Fdisk(Or even just trying to Install
<BR>
Windows in many cases). Doing this will allow
<BR>
you to create a new FAT 32 file system (I know
<BR>
that may be a big word for some people out there
<BR>
(IE: The Author) but FAT 32 is merely the
<BR>
filesystem used by Windows)
<BR>

<BR>
In short and in general, I would advise the
<BR>
author to know more about a subject before he
<BR>
writes about it in the future. Talking about a
<BR>
subject you barely know anything about will show
<BR>
exactly how little you know about it. Doing this
<BR>
will show people who do know what they are
<BR>
talking about that you are pulling things out of
<BR>
you A**. Making a habit of this will tend to
<BR>
lead people to discredit what you say.

i honestly feel sorry for your poor kids.  you really need to take a step back and look at whats going on....  how long do you think it would take a young kid to learn to "hack"....
<BR>

<BR>
chances are your child is learning what the start menu does, and how to play solitare.  perhaps this is what you consider to be the seed of all evil.

<BR>
What he doesnt realise is that if he keeps doing this, keeps keeping them from enjoying the world, they'll get so desparate to experience it, they'll go way over the top when they get the chance, ie by OD'ing or getting themselves pregnant. He is choking his children, he needs to let them experience life a little and make thier own mistakes, picking them up when they do, otherwise they'll never learn. He also needs to trust their judgement a little. Instead of meddling with their life, ask their judgement on it, ask them what they think they're doing. If they've been raised "correctly", they should be able to understand whats right and wrong, and make their OWN decisions based on what HE has taught them!
<BR>
In conclusion, DONT BLAME HIM just because he's been sucked in the the american way of parenting, its not really his fault.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Look at them rant and rave at you trying to let you know how smart and technically knowledgeable they are.

<BR>
Geeks,
<BR>
Y'all take yourselves and your computers to seriously. Step outside and get some fresh air and some exercise once and a while, will you. 
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe if you actually talked to another human being once in a while (no, chat rooms don't count) you would learn to appreciate what this guy just did to you to make you so mad.  It is called sarcastic wit.  
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you should try reading something other than a tech manual once in a while.  I suggest you try to read something by Mark Twain.  Maybe then you would recognize what this article is really all about.

Never argue with an idiot.  You will always wind up looking stupid.

<BR>
(Try it! Read it twice! That guy probably knows more about computers than it may appear. Nobody can be that stupit to believe all that stuff!)
<BR>

<BR>
But he forgot to write about some really important things:
<BR>

<BR>
1. You should really be alarmed if you find some files with the ending .bin on your computer. These files are part of a secret taliban hacking program used to support Osama Bin Laden. It is strongly recommended to delete all these files immediately and restart your system to remove any leftovers.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Never use any other internet browser than the Internet Explorer. Especially a decadent and illegally hacked browser called Mozilla will do permanent damage to your system. It will show up porn sites from time to time, esp. when your children are surfing, and will submit every information you enter to a hacker group.
<BR>

<BR>
3. If you find drawers called "Skins" or similar on your HD, then your son or any other user of your computer is highly probable allied with a nazi organisation, also called Skinheads. These drawers are often camouflaged as a subdrawer, e.g. of the drawer WinAmp.
<BR>

<BR>
4. WinAmp itself is a illegal hacking tool used to extract audio data from CDs. Of course the CDs are empty after that operation, since the music is on the harddisk then. The empty CDs are collected by some shops and sold as "CD-Rs", which are extremely illegal.
<BR>

<BR>
5. If you ever see hexadecimal numbers on the screen of your son, he is a hacker. Hexadecimal numbers are a satanic numbering system with strange letters inside, that only hackers can understand. In fact, anything on the the screen that you cannot read/understand is probably a part of a secret hacker slang.
<BR>

<BR>
6. A VERY dangerous thing are so-called "scene-demos". They contain fast flashing graphics and hypnotic electronic (!) music that will take control over your mind. There are also subconscious messages inside, written by hackers. These demos are an attempt to simulate the experience of doing drugs, and often also advertise the consumption of drugs. Note that there is just one letter missing from demos to demons.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Due to a license agreement with Microsoft, it is strictly prohibied to use backdrop pictures that were not shipped with Windows. This also applies to system sounds, color schemes, and screensavers. If you find your son doing so, call a specialist to format the harddisk and reinstall Windows. Do not try to reinstall Windows by yourself, as you might cause pernament damage by this.
<BR>

<BR>
8. If your son asks you to buy an optical mouse, refuse. Optical mouses are really a spy device with a micro camera inside, invented by soviet secret services.
<BR>

<BR>
9. If your kid plays games using both the mouse and the keyboard, he is already in a risky state of computer usage. If kids control games this way, they loose contact to the real world and completely vanish into the virtual reality. They won't be able to distinguish between the simulated and the real world, thus possibly doing terrible things. A sane person usually controls games with the keyboard only. Also do not use "force feedback joysticks", as the vibration may cause severe damage to the hand bones and musculature.
<BR>

<BR>
10. If you see in the history list of your webbrowser that your son has visited non-american websites (esp. german and russian), he is in trouble. All those sites contain unverified, illegal content. Especially in Russia, a normal person doesn't have internet access, therefore any russian homepages are created by communistic secret services or hackers who want to gather information about the western world. All german homepages contain nazi propaganda and are glorifying Adolf Hitler.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Too bad Comet Cursor only changes your mouse pointer and Bonzi Buddy is an interactive animal that helps you with your computer - both of them have absolutley nothing to do with hacking.  LMAO!

You poor, uneducated parent.  

Nearly every bit of that was beyond rediculous.  Oh, and also, it's RAVERS you're talking about here:9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 

If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. 

Got that, sugar?  Ok, just checking.  Oh, and by the way...with your standards of being a hacker...any imbecile is one.  Even my parents, who have absolutely no idea what they're doing with this machine, are hackers...says you.  hahahahahhah

*sigh* I hope you were <b>just kidding</b>, sir.  <strong>You don't know how wrong you are.</strong>  

Sincerely, 
Christine

My COMPUTERS have never failed to make me proud, and I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest COMPUTERS in the USA. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
IS YOUR FATHER A DUMBSHIT?
<BR>
To this end, I have decided to publish the top ten signs that your FATHER IS A DUMBSHIT. I advise any KIDS to read this list carefully and if their FATHER matches the profile, they should take action. A smart KID will first try to reason with their FATHER, before resorting to groundings, or even spanking. I pride myself that I have never had to spank a FATHER, and I hope this guide will help other KIDS to put a halt to their FATHERS DUMBSHITNESS before a spanking becomes necessary. 
<BR>

<BR>
1. DOES your FATHER KNOW WHAT AN ISP Is? 
<BR>

<BR>
(Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider.) 
<BR>

<BR>
1A. SORRY DUMBSHIT AOL IS NOT AN ISP, AOL IS AN ONLINE SOFTWARE, THE BEST SOFTWARE TO GAIN ACCESS TO YOUR CREDIT CARDS AND PERSONAL INFORMATION, AOL WAS FIRST HACKED BY MY GROUP BACK IN 1989 WHEN AOL COSTED 5.99 A MIN TO USE ON A DIAL UP 28000 BAUD MODEM RUNNING ON A 486. LOOK UP "PHISH" AND LOOK FOR HIDDED CHAT ROOMS.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>

<BR>
2A. HAHAHA KIDS WATCH OUT YOUR FATHER IS REAL PARINOID AND DUMBSHITED IF HE THINKS BONZI BUDDY THE TALKING PARROT IS A HACKING PROGRAM, AND OMG "FLASH" STUPID ASS FLASH IS A WEB BASED PROGRAM TO CREATE ANIMATION AND REAL TIME MOVIES.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
DUMBASS WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. 
<BR>

<BR>
OMFG HE FOUND OUT THAT AMD IS A REMAKE OF INTEL PROCESSORS, YOU STUPID ASS A PROCESSOR IS A PROCESSOR YOU CAN HAVE A SLOW VOLKSWAGON, OR A LAMBORGHINI, COMPARASON. FASTER THE BETTER THE COMPUTER WORKS FOR YOU.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds. 
<BR>

<BR>
There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you find any of these hacking manuals in your child's possession, confiscate them immediately. You should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves. You may meet with some resistance at first, but even booksellers have to bow to community pressure.
<BR>

<BR>
FIRST OFF THERE WOULD BE NO COMPUTERS NO INTERNET IF IT WASENT FOR A HACKER" DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT A HACKER IS??!?!? A HACKER IS A PROGRAMMER, A CRACKER IS A PERSON THAT BREAKS INTO ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND USES SUCH DEVICES TO GAIN ACCESS 
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day.  GO FIGURE DUMBASS, LETS SEE YOUR KID WANTS A FASTER PROCESSOR, MAYBE HES TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT THE FOOKING COMPUTER IS SO SLOW THAT YOU NEED A FASTER COMPUTER PROCESSOR CHIT IN ORDER TO GET THINGS DONE FASTER ON THE NET AND STUFF SO HE DONT HAVE TO SPEN "MORE THAN 30 MINS ON IT" COMMEN SENCE "DUMBSHIT"
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school. 
<BR>

<BR>
HAHAHA QUAKE IS A VIRTUAL EMTERTAINMENT GAME, IF YOU WAS SMART TO LOOK INTO THIS SHIT, PEOPLE ACTULLY WIN PRIZES WINNING TOURNEY PLAYING THIS GAME, MAYBE HE WAS TRYING TO HELP OUT AND GET YOUR POOR ASS MONEY TO BUY A "FASTER COMPUTER PROCESSOR"
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in. Keep trying to get through to him, no matter how much he retreats into himself. 
<BR>

<BR>
HAHA, HES PROLLY GETTING TIRED OF YOUR DUMBSHITNESS. LIGHTEN UP AND LISTEN TO A KID 1 DAY, IT WILL SAVE YOU MONEY AND TIME IN THE LONG RUN. YES KIDS KNOW SOMETHING, THEY GROW UP IN THIS AGE, THEN DONT ROTT AWAY AND GROW PAST 60 THESE DAYS LIKE A DUMBSHIT FATHER.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.  
<BR>

<BR>
LINUX IS AN OPERATING THAT IS MUCH EASIER THAT WINDOWS WILL EVER BE, LINUX IS BASICLLY WHAT THE COMPUTER WAS BEFORE WINDOWS, AND WAS THE ORIGINAL OPERATIONG SYSTEM NEXT TO UNIX, FYI UNIX IS WHAT IS USED TO MAKE YOUR CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS AT THE BANK. GO SCREW YOURSELF YOUR NEVER GONNA BE SAFE IN THIS WORLD.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. 
<BR>

<BR>
HE JUST TRYING TO COVER HIMSELF UP SO PEOPLE DONT KNOW "MY FATHER IS A DUMBSHIT"
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases. Also, the reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight. For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically. 
<BR>

<BR>
I encourage all parents to read through this guide carefully. Your child's future may depend upon it. Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison, and tear your family apart. It cannot be taken too seriously. 
<BR>
 
<BR>
TECHERS THESE DAYS WILL KICK A KID OUT OF SCHOOL JUST BECAUSE THERE WEARING BAGGY PANTS, HOW THE FUCK DO KIDS GET AN EDUCATION IF THEY KICK THEM OUT OF SCHOOL, DUMBASS PEOPLE USE YOUR BRAIN. 89% OF KIDS THAT GRADUATE SCHOOL ARE STUPID CAUSE THEY MISS SCHOOL CAUSE THE TEACHING ACADEMIC BOARD ARE FUCKED "DUMBSHIT FATHERS OR MOTHERS" DONT KICK A KID OUT OF SCHOOL CAUSE THERE CHEWING BUBBLE GUM, OR WEARING A BLACK TEE SHIRT, OR EVEN FIGHTING. THEY DONT GET AN EDUCATION THAT WAY, THEY LEARN BY WATCHING THE PERSON THAT IS THE MENTOR. THEY SEE A TEACHER KICKING A KID OUT OF SCHOOL JUST SHOWS POWER, SO THE KID WANTS POWER TO. GEES PEOPLE THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.

  You seem to making some grave mistakes. First off your description of clothing is not that of a Hacker, but a Raver. YES, there IS a difference. Though many Ravers are Hackers, not all Hackers are Ravers. A vast majority of Hackers are pastey white american guys who had no friends in highschool, and are striking back at the world by trashing web pages, and pirating movies. Ravers are useually Hackers that actually DO have friends, and dress in the manner that you have descibed before. How do I know, guess =).
<BR>
*Throws Knife at Poster's head*
<BR>
   Techno is electronic music, so are trance, rave, and most Remixes. Idiot. 
<BR>
*Throws annother Knife*
<BR>
   Not all Hackers/Ravers have bad grades. It takes geneius to be a true hacker, and though we spend most of our time on the computer, up late everynight, getting poor vision from staring at a screen constantly, most still get good grades. I have a 3.9 average, isnt that a little proof against ur theory. 
<BR>
*Throws annother Knife*
<BR>
   I'm constantly on the computer, but im not DOS'n stites. I'm chatting, reading, doing homework, playing games, surfing, listening to music, doing homework, and watching music videos and anime. I spend 6 hours a day at least on the computer, and, as stated above, i have kick ass grades. 
<BR>
*Chucks a Knife at the Poster's Balls*
<BR>
   Everyone wants a faster comptuer, even you do, so why do you think only hackers would want more memory, a faster processer, or better video? Don't you want to be able to use the computer without waiting half an hour to open up a single webpage? Don't you hate it when a warning pops up telling you "There is not enough memory to perform this task. Please close some programs or restart computer" every 3 seconds? I think you do. Bitch.
<BR>
*Throws a knife at his spleen*
<BR>
   You don't 'USE' Quake, you play it. It's a game. You shoot things. You Multiplay. You chat with friends. You have fun. There is no training for weapons, how can clicking a mouse ever prepare you to use a rocket launcher or a rail gun? Not everyone is talking about hacking, alot of the time im just talking about last night's episode of '24', or how i just sneaked up on someone in the game and took him out.
<BR>
*Throws knife at eye*
<BR>
   There is no such thing as a hacker manual, no one needs to make one. If ur a hacker and you know it, then you dont need any training or a book to tell you what to do. Most of those books are fiction and non fiction books about groups of hackers that got caught, or didnt get caught, not guides or tricks of the trade. Others of those are just books about programing, like the 'For Dummies' books that are availible for anything and everything.
<BR>
*Throws annother knife at his head*
<BR>
   Its Linux, not Lunix, idiot, and its not a hacking program. Its annother Operating System, Like Windows or Mac, it just runs better and faster with less errors and more options. It also sounds cooler and is more widely prefered then Windows or Mac, its just that everyone is afraid to try something new, like people who get comptuers for the first time think that AOL will be the best thing to use because of false advertising on TV, so they get it, and it sucks, and they dont want to get rid of it for some odd reason that not even I can comprihend, like your stupidity. 
<BR>
*Throws a knife at his crotch again*
<BR>
   Annother thing, is AOL has a constant tendancy to crash, and when i say constant, i mean it to the full extent of the word. When I had AOL on my first computer, not only was it the slowest browser on the planet, but it disconnected me every 4 minutes. AOL's Servers are so terrible, it doesnt make sense why they even offer you connection to the internet when their just gonna kick you every other minute. If a kid asks for a better ISP, its cause the one he is on right udderly sucks. If your gonna use AOL, for god sakes use it for Browsing, IM, and Mail, get Erols or something for your ISP.
<BR>
*Throws knife at Poster's Leg*
<BR>
   When a kid says he has no problems, cant control his emotions, or cant distinguish right from wrong, it is because they are A) In love, B) Depressed, or C) Both. 
<BR>
*Throws knife at chest*
<BR>
   The Pacifiers and Glowsticks are just Raver things like the pants, clothes and music. They just go with the whole Raver thing, hard to explain to an idiot like you. God. Learn the RIGHT facts before you come here posting some shit like this. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

I would recommend you look for better places to get your information. if you need help feel free to contact me at bobdihack@hotmail.com maybe you will learn that a kid learning new stuff doesn't make them a hacker and that parents like you stunt the growth of the american kids minds.

and a change of isp's?  aol is one of the WORST and MOST OVER-PRICED ISPs out there.  it is slow and uses up A LOT of RAM (which means the computer goes slow), and thus your son probably had trouble with any online gaming he was attempting (note to the moron: gaming is exactly what i say..it is playing a game).

Raymond...all are novels!  faky futuristic sci-fi novels!  "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly is a manual for PROGRAMMING with PERL!!!  perl is a computer language you fuicking idiot!  if your gona want your son to 'succeed' with computers, he's gona have to at least learn something as basic as PERL!

Linux!  spell it right!  linux!!!  it was NOT made by microsoft, is NOT illegal, and is NOT based on 'xenix', it is based on UNIX!  any program can connect to machines on the internet 'without a telephone' because you DONT NEED A TELEPHONE TO GET ON THE IDIOT!  GOD YOU'RE SUCH A FUCKING DUMBASS!!!  MP3 IS A CODE, NOT A PROGRAM!  AND IT'S NOT STEALING!

teenagers go with dif appearences when they hang out with dif freinds.  colored hair is usually associated with punk rockers, glo sticks with ravers.  if you want to be so stereotypical, then if he's got the hair search him for weed and if he's got the sticks search him for e (thas EXTACY, a common drug, since you probly dont know you fucking dumbass!)

all hackers i know DO NOT struggle academically, especially in math-related courses, because, moron, math is essential to the world of hackingc and just about any other computer related field

Bonzi Buddy and Comet Cursor are waste of time programs that don't do anything but waste space and time. Flash is a plugin for your browser that lets you view animations created using flash. And I'm sorry if your son realizes that you need new hardware and you don't I really am, but I guess he's smarter than you. As far as hacking manuals, I read 'Hannibal' so does that mean I'm going to become a cannibal? By your logic than I guess so. Time spent on the computer is irrelevant, most teens sit online mindlessly chatting on aim. Ahahahahahahahaha Quake is an old 3-d online computer game you dumb motherfucker. And ya know, teens are often defiant, ask EVERY parent in this damn country. I don't even know where to begin with Linux. hmm...well its an open source operating system written by European programmers. Notice how they are EUROPEAN not Soviet, and as open source would imply, they are all free and anyone can change the code to try and improve it. While we're on operating systems, DOS stands for Disk Operating System and is the basic OS on all computers, people may run programs in DOS, but it in itself IS NOT a hacking program. Now what exactly does style have to do with anything, you're telling me that you've never changed your style?...An otaku is someone that is a big fan of japanese animation. And computers don't give off radiation, personally I think if your son has your natural ignorance that would explain why ;).

This greatly concerns me that such things can hit children at such a young age.  I will be on guard for the installation of lunix on any of my home computers.  I'm greatly thankful that there is someone out there who has so much care for the youth of today.  As for the rest of you people who think he his full of balogney.  I pitty you and wish you had the intelligence of this man.  I have seen the notorious bonzi buddy and this must stop!!!

well.... that seems awfully general.. i found this article almost funny, being a highschool student, happen to know plenty of people who dress like the supposed "hackers" and have nothing to do with that whatsoever...so.. i'd suggest you refine this....or just ignore it. maybe your child is becoming reclusive for other reasons..don't pin them as a criminal just cause they're different.. try to talk to them, not breathe down their necks and make unjustified assumptions about their lifestyles

<BR>

<BR>
when I first read your article, I tought it was a joke. (don't take this bad)
<BR>

<BR>
your son is not a computer criminal because he read about computers and network security. He
<BR>
might be a computer kiddy who plays with nuke or
<BR>
spoofing software, if this case apply ban him
<BR>
from using a computer, you will do us a great
<BR>
favor. 
<BR>

<BR>
A hacker is someone who learn things by himself.
<BR>
some times good things, some times bad. But all
<BR>
those things a true and exist, so they shall be
<BR>
known.  that's why lots of big security company
<BR>
hires hackers to help them to emprove their system
<BR>
against criminals. those hacker gain more money
<BR>
in a year than you will probably ever do.
<BR>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
well, I agree that AOL sucks. (it spy you too. no joke)
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
well, to learn something you got to try it till
<BR>
you know how to use it. that's the main mean of
<BR>
hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
hardware update have absolutly nothing to do
<BR>
with hacking. You could hack the nasa from a
<BR>
comodor 64 (kevin mitnik did it)
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
well. some one wrote the bible and billions
<BR>
of people believed him for 2000 years, why
<BR>
not read what others have to say ?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
Learning is a slow experience.
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
lots of people more qualified than you consider
<BR>
me as a hacker, I never played quake.. ever.
<BR>
it's a GAME hacking is not, unless you learn
<BR>
how to code games and cheats. is it huring 
<BR>
someone ?
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
it's a bad thing ? you really want your son
<BR>
to be a sheet ? 
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>
it's "Linux". a OS (Operating System) devlopped
<BR>
by "big bad and scary hackers".
<BR>

<BR>
this os is more stable and secure than microsoft windows will ever be. and there's no spyware that
<BR>
reports all your moves to a big money company.
<BR>

<BR>
that's why it's used and trusted by 99.9% of isp (Internet Service Provider).
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
you never did ? you should :) it's fun. mankind have changed is vestimental appearence accross the
<BR>
years, your son is a criminal because he did it ?
<BR>
welcome in 2001 dude.
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically?
<BR>

<BR>
your son dont need a computer to fail ;)
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I know hackers who are pay 200$ per hour, how cute.
<BR>

<BR>
h3 
<BR>

<BR>
p.s.: forgive my bad english (not cause I dropped
<BR>
school, I'm french.)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First off the term "Hacking" means to alter (a computer program): hacked her text editor to read HTML. Without hackers we wouldn't have operating systems. We wouldn't even have DOS. If we all listened to your mad rantings and ravings you wouldn't have those nifty little anti-virus programs or the anti-"hacking" and I use the term hacking in anti-hacking loosely. Because its not hacking when it's used like that, it's vandalising.
<BR>

<BR>
Second if he asked to change isp's it is most likely cause he is getting sick of being disconnected or not being able to connect period.
<BR>

<BR>
Third. The programs you mentioned have nothing to do with hacking. ZERO. Comet cursor is used to change your mouse icon. If you have alot of users on the computer and everyone likes something different this is a useful program. 
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy is a fun little program. It monitors your use of the computer. Remembers webpages you go to and reads emails to you. Does that sound like hacking? Hmm whole lotta illegal stuff goin on there boy howdy. 
<BR>

<BR>
Flash is a webbrowser addon that is supported by Microsoft. It is used to view flash websites. However the flash you are talking about is most likely the program used to make those flash websites. In which case that would explain the need for more bandwidth if your son is interested in making webpages. He could have a job doing that and make more from it in a month than you do it a year. 
<BR>

<BR>
By taking that away all you are doing is hurting your sons education in the computer. Which is why you bought it in the first place is it not?
<BR>

<BR>
The reason he is requesting a better graphics card and memory is most likely because he likes to play computer games that require more power. The AMD Processors are a leading brand in computer processors. They beat Intel in most of their tests. And just for your info the processor does nothing to prevent hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
From the few titles of books you mentioned it sounds like your son is interested in writing programs for the computer. Which would explain the hours of time spent on the computer. It takes a long time to code programs.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online multiplayer GAME. That's right a game. Not a hacking program. Not a hacking association of some kind. A game. It also has the option to alter or "hack" the game to design modifications to it and make it more interesting. 
<BR>

<BR>
The reason your son is more arguementative is because he is growing up and you're giving him alot of bs that he doesn't need. Just from reading this crap I agree with him. You are smothering him and you do need to back off. 
<BR>

<BR>
First off you didn't even spell the name of this program right. It is Linux. It is an operating system yes. It is actually more stable than windows when setup right. Most people use it for servers. Which in your son's case could be either a Quake server or a webpage server. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm not even going to comment on this next part because it's just pure idiocy. And you call yourself a model parent. I bet you 50$ right now that by the time you're son turns 18, unless you change your outlook on parenting, he will have his bags packed and be out the door. If not sooner. I suggest, next time before you go posting stuff like this in the future, that you do some research.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

  After reading the article "Is your son a hacker" I have the following comments.
<BR>

<BR>
1.  HAHAHA!!  Geezus, was this written in the early 90's?
<BR>

<BR>
2.  Comet Cursor, Bonzai Buddy, and Flash...  These are hacker programs?  Since when?  If they are then why are major sites advertising them?
<BR>

<BR>
3.  I do condone you for attempting to be a role model parent, for there's a lack of such these days.  Trying too hard can have the opposite effects - read about it.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Kick ass video cards, and advanced gaming (quake, OF, HL, TFC, etc...) are by no means an "indicator" that one may be a hacker.  These advanced games and video cards are merely a component needed to aquire the "full effect" of a gaming experience.  If your son was to come across a person who may be a "hacker" in one of these games, it would then be up to your son to make the decision whether or not to participate in such activities - upon making these decisions would reflect upon how the child was raised.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  The wardrobe of a hacker!  I couldn't help, but to laugh my ass off at what was said to be a hackers wardrobe.  What you described as their wardrobe can be found in nearly any community.  It's people like you and the people that you got your information from that is widening the gap between judging people on how they "look" superfiscially and who they really are internally.  "You can't judge a book by its cover." 
<BR>

<BR>
6.  The word "hacker".  The media and people like you have this word and the people it represent all twisted and screwed up.  I would say more blame is on the media's behalf since it reaches a larger crowd and these days everyone believes what is seen on TV as the truth.  Hackers started out as curious people.  They just wanted to satisfy their curiosity, things didn't get destroyed.  Thanks to the media a whole new generation of "violent" hackers has been produced.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  I do respect you for being a responsible caring parent.  Give your kids some space now and then.  Trust them.  Even you said that they are teens, they need to discover whom they are.  Be there to "guide" them, not "control" them...
<BR>

<BR>
That's about all I have time for.  I'm about to change into my flourescent orange jeans, put on a bright green shirt (because it matches my hair) and proceed to sit in front of my PC while "hacking" my way through the dense electronic jungle called the internet... who knows maybe I'll run across your son in quake, or run across you personal information on your hard drive. (just joking) All in all - have a nice day :)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">first of all, you need to know that most of what you are saying is mostly unresearched horse puck! <br> <br> i have a few problems with this article... 
<br><br>  <br> <br> <b>#1: Spanking </b><br> first of all, spanking is child abuse. <br> second, why on earth is there a web link to spanking.com? do you know that that is an S&M web site? 
<br> <b>#2: AOL</b><br>  i dont use AOL but i have used it before, and my experiences with it have been frustrating and insulting to my intelect. it is not as great as you think. 
<br> <b>#3: "Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". "</b><br>   comet cursor, i admit, is hacker software... but not one that you can use! it is somewhat like what are known as "backdoor programs" allowing OTHER hackers to easily hack INTO your comp.<br>    bonzi buddy is similar. <br>    flash is a program that allows one to view interactive visual snazzy web pages. it is NOT hacker software, and there is no wat that one can use it to aid hacking. 
<br> <b>#4: DOS</b><br>  i would like you to try to uninstall DOS. it is IMPOSSIBLE!!!! the reason it is impossible is because windows was written with the aid of DOS. without DOS, your computer would not work. 
<br> <b>#5: "7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? "</b><br>  this, i believe to be a natural teenager side-effect, so to speak. almost ALL teenagers go through a period of this. <br><b>#6: "They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. "</b><br> i would like to see a stereo that is hooked up to the internet, or at least has the ability to do so. this is comon sense. 
<br> <b>#7: "Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. "</b> <br> telnet used to COME with computers, damnit! <br> 
<br> <b>#8: "If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. "</b>
<br>  these are clothes that ravers wear, not hackers. albeit some hackers are ravers too. pacifiers, some ravers cary these around because they take drugs that degrade their jaws, so that their jaws fall out if they are not careful. the pacifiers allow them to have something that does not require special attention to keeping their jaw up. <br> 
<br> <b>#9: SON! </b><br> hackers are not all male!!!! many hackers a/bre female as well!!!! <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Vicious out <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> P.S. this has been a message from a hacker<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Not one of your "signs your son is a hacker" is a sign of anything but your own complete ignorance of anything to do with computers, the internet, or parenting.
<BR>

<BR>
The only thing your son seems to be attempting to do is to learn to program and use the computer properly. It is painfully apparent that you have no idea what a hacker is. Perhaps you should look it up in any computer dictionary. Oh, I forgot. You equate books on computers with hacking!

<BR>

<BR>
Damn kids. They're all alike. 
<BR>

<BR>
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? 
<BR>

<BR>
I am a hacker, enter my world... 
<BR>

<BR>
Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... 
<BR>

<BR>
Damn underachiever. They're all alike. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." 
<BR>

<BR>
Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike. 
<BR>

<BR>
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... 
<BR>

<BR>
Or feels threatened by me... 
<BR>

<BR>
Or thinks I'm a smart ass... 
<BR>

<BR>
Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here... 
<BR>

<BR>
Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike. 
<BR>

<BR>
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. 
<BR>

<BR>
"This is it... this is where I belong..." 
<BR>

<BR>
I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... 
<BR>

<BR>
Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike... 
<BR>

<BR>
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. 
<BR>

<BR>
This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. 
<BR>

<BR>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

The funny part is there is more to it then what you saw. i have alot of friends who are what you described, but infact couldnt even hack a simple code on there own computer. when they become elite and know what they are doing, then they can be classified as hackers, til then, we just like to call them newbies. i think ive met peter, but if i havent, make sure to have him find and contact me. thanks pal. later

my case is backed by the following.

If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines...

<BR>
he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association  ||  as in the anime guys?  http://www.otaku.com/

Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".   ||  you can't seriously believe than anyone would ever call that hacker software.  this is the type of stuff ignorant gullible people put on their computers (except most people have flash).
<BR>

<BR>
what I am hoping is that some of you get that its a joke, but you thought you would make it even funnier by pretending to take it seriously, and we all laugh.
<BR>

<BR>
there are many more humorous points in the article, i hope you dont think you are infinitely smarter than T Reginald Gibbons because he thinks 
<BR>
AMD "is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips" even though they were founded and are headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.

sorry for wasting the time of anybody who gets it.

Go to www.happyhacker.org if u want any type of info related to hacking. And Hacking is the art of understanding computers not breaking the law :p

I do feel that ppl would be very misinformed if they started to actual believe the signs that have been written in the article, you r gonna be assigning the term Hacker to half the young ppl of america/europe.

It seems that everyone that has a legitimate point is automatically known as the enemy, which i think is utterly retarded. Unless people open up their minds and realize that some, if not most, of these facts are not that, then people will have a hard time getting anywhere stopping people from doing these things that are apparently so wrong. To properly identify a problem, you have to systematically look over all the possible signs, and when one can be proven to not be a sign, ruled out. You cant just childeshly say "I'm right, your wrong, this is the way it is" or all you will accomplish is making everyones life miserable and you will show how incredibly incapable of of managing your own life, much less someone elses. Take a minute to look over all the points made, rather then just blow them off as some ultra defense tactic set up by "hackers".<BR><BR></FONT></td>

but the answering comments are histerical.

some of them (like the comment about female hackers) are so out of date and stupid.. I hope they were jokes as well. if not then there should be tests performed before a person is allowed online.. the net is no place for these closed minded newbies with their 1800 attitudes

ok enough ranting..  cheers to the author of the main article.. you really got alot of ppl going

Oh and about the AMD comment, You said you own a compaq...well...did you know that Compaq supports these 'hacker' chips.  I think you should burn your computer and never leave your house again, while your at it, set your whole house ablaze while your inside.  do us all that favor. I'm not even gonna get started on the "Lunix" thing, you kan't even spell it right.  And shifting the blame of your kids bad grades to the computer instead of yourself is the kind of bulls**t that makes me sick.  Take some responsibilty.  I'm a parent, i spend an average of 12 hrs a day on a computer (work/home), and my 4 year old son, who probably knows more about computers than you, spends a good part of his day on his computer.  And "Otaku" is Japanese for Geek you idiot.  Your a idiot and a waste of flesh.  You are simply a horrible little monster and i pray for your quick and merciful death.

Of course, you guys are all so quick to use your knowledge of these things to explain the exact height at which the joke flew over your heads, so maybe my logic is a bit flawed.  Still, it's ironic that there's so many people here going insane over the apparent ignorance and lack of rational thought of the writer, when none of you have the capabilities of rational thought needed to recognize satire.  The real shock and outrage here should be directed at YOU.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hello.  My name is Mike Convente.  While looking at a site I visit often, I read a post that tells of a story a one Mr T Gibbons has written.  The post tells of how that he is ignorant for his stupid article.  Not being convinced, I click the link and read the story.  It's title is "Is your son a Computer Hacker?"  After reading the article, I can not say one good thing about your site.  However, I can say many things about Mr. T Gibbons.  First of all, his quote saying that he "is a model parent" can be disputed.  First of all, a model parent trusts his/her children to do the right thing (I.E. - at a party).  I'm not naive, but once I have children, I will set it straight with them that it is not worth screwing your life you by doing drugs and drinking alcohol.  But after that, it's up to them.  
<BR>
     
<BR>
     Anyway, back to the main point.  I was very enraged after reading the 10 signs your son is a hacker.  The first sign is so absolutely absurd that anyone with at least a decent amount of computer knowledge will know it's BS.  I know many of my peers have another ISP rather than AOL.  The main reason is because AOL sucks!  Plus, with broadband becoming less and less expensive, why would anyone pay $25 a month for AOL.  And besides, I have DSL and I'm not a hacker by any means.  The second sign is even more absurd.  "Popular hacker software includes Comet Cursor, Bonzi Buddy, and Flash."  Before Mr. T Gibbons gets the nerve to post such a story (which he has a right to do in America) he should get his facts straight.  Comet Cursor is a specialized cursor software that allows custom cursors for a website (I.E. - a StarWars themed site could have a light saber for a cursor.)  Bonzi Buddy is an online helper, such as a search engine or item finder.  And Flash is a program in which web designers create intros to websites.  By no means do any of those programs help hackers or are affiliated with hackers in general.
<BR>
     Next, by no means should AMD be branded "hacker helpers".  AMD makes quality parts and many editors of PC magazines seem to think so to.
<BR>
     Another noteworthy sign of his "Hacker Signs" is "Does your son use Lunix?"  First of all, it's LINUX, not Lunix.  And second of all, if Linux was such a bad OS, why do many companies use it?  Gee, maybe because it is much more stable and safer than Windows 2000?  Oh, BTW, Linux won't mess up your hard drive.  Because if it did, then people wouldn't download it off their site or buy it in the store.
<BR>

<BR>
     The most absurb of all is the stereotyping of "hackers".  Mr. T Gibbons says "kids who wear baggy pants, and have spiked hair may be hackers."  Well a few of my friends have spiked hair, and they all get A's in honor classes.
<BR>
     Last of all, I would appreciate it if you could get this message to Mr. T Gibbons.  He needs to know that he is a naive person and is ignorant to the facts.  I would appreciate him not stereotyping toward people's clothing styles, because I have a few peers who don't go overboard, but do dress like that.  Anyway, my last statement is that people like Mr. T Gibbons are the ignorant, isolated people of society.  I feel sorry for his children who have to put up with his insane views.  Thank you for your time.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oh my oh my, feel sorry for your Kids having you 
<BR>
to their father. Are you going watch every step they take? Your have a deep problem. I'm a computer technican and a parent of two teenager.
<BR>
Can tell you that I'm the mother. And for the first your opinion about sons and daughter frightens me a lot. Where you born in the 18th century or what? Wake up!!!!! Today a girl is equal to a boy. 
<BR>
And today you play many games over the internet, and that doesn't make your son a hacker. 
<BR>
How about asking him to learn you!
<BR>

<BR>
1. Due to gaming over the net you demand a faster ISP, nothing strange in that. 
<BR>
2. The programs you mentioned is not for hacking, 
<BR>
it's freeware or demos for helping you get free upgrade and stuff for your computer in an easy way. Not all programs is need to bought with license. There is Demos, freeware and shareware. 
<BR>
Before you talk you should find the real fact.  
<BR>
3. New hardware is also a demand when you play. 
<BR>
And AMD is a normal CPU just like INTEL, but better, have nothing to do with hacking at all. 
<BR>
Now your talking like you know but not. And many games need to have more memory and very good graphic-card, just to give you the full expression of the game. 
<BR>
Buy yourself a pc-game magazine and you'll maybe learn something before talk. 
<BR>
4. What can I say, have you read them yourself. Doubt it. It's not any manual, they are stories, good reading, just like any other books you like.  
<BR>
5. It's not against the law sharing computers over the network if the other side gives it promision. Why do you think it's other 
<BR>
computers DOS you see?? Very rare this days just having DOS. And I don't think you would react if he played football the hole day. But sitting in front of the computer more than 30 min is not normal in your eyes. Well times have changed. 
<BR>
Many comunications is done by the computer instead
<BR>
of talking over the phone. This is called chat. 
<BR>
Among this and all other stuff you could do with the computer (gaming, writing etc) it have become the central point of many young people. And that
<BR>
takes it's time. 
<BR>
6.Quake is a game!!!!! Not good in my eyes, but a game many people like. On the net you have a competition against others in team called clans. 
<BR>
That means they have to discuss inside the clan to win the game. Just like a football team do.
<BR>
This show you don't understand anything about the 
<BR>
internetworld or gamingworld at all. The only thing you know is the "real" world, which you can put your hands on like football and basketball.  
<BR>
7.All Kids do more and less become to this state
<BR>
in their development, have you forgot your own childhood. It's their way to grow up and release their bands to their parents, especially when they become teenagers. Just normal behavior. 
<BR>
8. Linux it's one of the best free operating system on the market, and notice it's free. 
<BR>
Many bigger companys is installing this in their 
<BR>
servers because it's very easy to configure and 
<BR>
more safe than for example Microsofts operating system. Abd I doubt that big buisness companies is hackers. You claim that Linux is just for hackers........
<BR>
And to say that it destroys the harddisk. Make me laugh.
<BR>
9. Haven't you learned what fasion is?? Peoples 
<BR>
clothes doesn't say a word of your inside. 
<BR>
Let me tell you a story. 
<BR>
In the computer world long a go there where som young guys, very clever, started a new software company. The norm for clothes were suits. They dressed them self like hippies. And no shoes.....
<BR>
The company's name was Microsoft........
<BR>
So the clothes doesn't make the man. Hope you got the point.
<BR>
10. Thats a part of the growing up behaivor. I would act like that with a father like you. 
<BR>
Give them some freedom under responsibility, and show them respect. They are not only your kids they are selfdependent humans.
<BR>

<BR>
Finally try to be a friend to your children and learn the facts before you shout it out. 
<BR>
Respect your children!
<BR>
The one that need a change in behavior is actually you. 
<BR>

Next flash is a animation program, you make pretty litte animations with it. Next "dosing" as you call it, is needed on a pc. If you ever break your computer you will need to know dos to fix it or remove a virus or reformat or alot of things that arent in any way hacking. Next if your son known perl or cgi, he is very smart to have learned that on his own. Perl is a progrraming language that you use on website or in a shell script. If you ever used a cedit card online you have used a perl based language script. once again not hacking. I am not even going to comment on the glow stick thing, that was so stupid. I think someone wacth the movie hackers one tomany times and thinks hollywood made true movie. But of course why not take the word of your little kid when she screams hacker I am sure she knows everything about it right. You son probubly just has a better understanding of computer then you and your intimidated by it. The amount of time he spends at his age is probubly not good, but some people are just like that. He could grow up to be very successful in computers if it wasnt for you being affriad of cursor changing programs. Why dont you really od your research instead of freaking out. You say you ave photoshop but you think flash is a hacker program. they are both one of the same. check out these sites and really learn something.

and the banzi buddy thing is a just alittle charecter that sits on your desktop and makes lame noises. You have got to be the dumbest person alive to say all this bs. Educate yourself first before crying wolf. If you would like to see what a real hacker looks like and how they act and what they use let me know and I will be happy to show you for your sons sake. I think you have just punished your son and insted you should have believed him and not the 3 year old.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

To the author of this article, I solute you.  You managed to write a creative and quite humorous satire of the modern over-protective ill-informed parent.  The best part of it all is that so many people didn't get it.  I especially like the link under "17 year old girls".  I think if all these profane posters actually went to all those links they'd figure out the whole thing was a joke.

I've installed things without permission before (sound mixer type things).  I ask for new hardware all the time (at present I want a new CD-rom).  I'm not a hacker.  Also, what if one's child already has an additude?  And what if your child is already not good at math?  My question is; why do you sound so paranoid?  Frankly, I'm not a hacker.  Not even a white-hat hacker.  I know for a fact that with some simple unix commands I could get into a server no prob.  I don't.  Why?  Becuase it's disrespecting other peoples property and privacy.

Your kids sound like good people whos parents rule their lives.  Now myself, i am a 15 year old 9th grader with straight A's in honors classes.  I live in Los Angeles California.  My parents have been very open minded and have allowed me to make my own choices, which you obviously have not allowed them to do.  My parents love me more than anyone and take time out of their busy schedules as doctors to spend time with me, for to them it is the most important thing in the world.  I love my parents also, and they know that i have proper judgment and can handle situations that require a great deal of maturity.  Now you sir, come across as a parent who is completely ignorant of the fact that there is a whole world out there and u cannot keep your child in a bubble forever.  You need a makeover on your parenting skills.

I was referred to another of my "hacker" friends to this web post.  I found it both ammusing and frightening at the same time.  I refer to you, Mr. Gibbons as a fool in two senses of the word.

You've bashed the good name of Linus Torvalds, a brilliant man from Finland, who made a powerful, Unix like OS for the desktop user.  And offered an alternative to Windows.  Without the option of Linux, the computer market is no different than the communism that is reffered to so hatefully in this article.

<BR>
The situation you have described is not hacking, it is exploitation, your son exploiting your feeble brain to be more exact.
<BR>

<BR>
The appearance of your son means that he is a raver and by this means he sucks back chemical drugs.  This is due to your budget parenting.
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is struggling academically then he is as dumb as a brick.  Any "hacker" who has poor math/science skills has a case of mistaken identity.
<BR>

<BR>
You should seek professional help for your damaged family and your pitiful brain.  I recommend going to highschool, as this can help develop basic cognitive skills.  Plus highschool offers parenting courses for teenage whores who are too dumb for birthcontrol, you would be able to benefit from this course as it would teach you some parenting skills.

Seems you have no idea what you are talking about and that you are worried for nothing.
<BR>

<BR>
Almost every computer user have a period when he learns more or less about hacking. Not many people become full-grown hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
This you wrote:
<BR>
"Popular hacker software includes Comet Cursor, "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash"."
<BR>

<BR>
Download these programs and see what they does.
<BR>
They have nothing to do with hacking. Soooo Lame posting this article without getting the info about what these programs actually is used for.
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is only changing your computers cursor.
<BR>

<BR>
With Flash you make intros to webpages and programs.
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy i dont have a clue and dont want to find out either.
<BR>

<BR>
yeye...try to learn to know your children.

So please explain how it's used to hack.
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly, those cursor things, they're used to CHANGE your cursor. Yes, they use the Internet to function but how do you hack? You have no access to another person's PC or ISP. All you can do is change your desktop cursor when you're online.
<BR>

<BR>
About the clothes thing, there's no proof that it's true. It could be a passing fad or even attention seekers. Hackers wouldn't want to draw attention to themselves. So why would they go around wearing pacifiers and carrying glowsticks?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
So, after I post this note I am going to stick a pipe bomb in  my mouth left over from the last orphanage I mail-bombed and kill myself.  I urge you to post an article on the "Anarchist's Cookbook" as well as that is where I learned how to make bombs.  This freedom of speech and freedom of ideas thing really must come to an end.  We have to save our fellow Americans by showing them the true path that is the Mormon Church.  Tell your friends and don't let my death be in vain.  Please Mr. Gibbins.  God Bless you.
<BR>

<BR>
And have a Merry Christmas.  You ignorant retard, I thought humans with such a narrow and small mind like yours didn't exist.  Know I know to keep an eye out for you people.  For you and yours should be sent to college, and educated so that you can realize just how dumb you are.  I truly feel sorry for you and feel bad for your son, who lives in a house where he is held back.  Run away kid, never look back.

The original post is so incredibly ignorant, misinformed and paranoid that its hard to believe that guy is really serious! I feel deeply sorry for your kid, for having someone as you as parent...he must be a repressed, passive agressive person ready to blow up at any time! And you wonder why you have teenage killings? You see evil everywhere, you repress everything you dont understand...

I hope your kids will be able to learn for themselves, because you only make their passage into adulthood more difficult.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Ignorance is &lt;B&gt;not&lt;/B&gt; an excuse.  Just because so-and-so says that Rock-and-Roll is for Devil Worshippers does not mean that it is true or that he does not have some hidden agenda.  Research a little bit and then make informed comments instead of just giving some knee-jerk reaction that has no basis of reason.
<BR>

<BR>
People get so worked up and afraid of the tiniest things they do not understand.  Instead of opening their mind and learning about it, they immediately just decide to go nuts and shield everyone.  All of the ignorant people that just want to burn 'Catcher in the Rye', 'The Wizard of Oz', and Harry Potter books whould just stop and read the books first with an &lt;B&gt;open mind&lt;/B&gt; and then make an educated decision.  Do you think that just because a kid has a computer that they spend time on that they are suddenly hackers or porn monkeys or some other kind of reprobate?

<BR>

<BR>
Here are a few areas that you are displaying a thorough lack of even basic knowledge:
<BR>

<BR>
1. ISP:
<BR>
Changing your ISP is not a tool to encourage hacking.  AOL's limitations, and lack of service would be justification enough to switch. You mention the child saftey filters provided by AOL.  This is a content filter, and has nothing to do with preventing a hacker from using tools like Saint, Satan, Tiger Suite, Etc. and breaking into someone's system.  Absolutely nothing.  Learn the basic terminology, and then understand what it means.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  Programs:
<BR>
Flash is not a hacking tool.  It is a utility that allows multimedia amimations on a web browser. It is produced by Macromedia, and Macromedia is one of the largest producers of software for creating internet sites in the world.  Macromedia is perhaps the market leader, if not, in the top three, of internet creation software.  Flash is usually a plug-in for your browser. Most people do not need to purchase Flash unless they intend to author browser based animations. The Flash plug-ins are available free of charge from the manufacturer.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Hardware:
<BR>
Video card speed / capacity has NOTHING to do with hacking in any possible sense. This is ONLY needed for game playing or possibley CAD/modeling applications.  I can absolutely assure anybody that hacking is not a graphics intensive activity on any level.  A standard $15.00 SVGA video card will suffice.  A large hard drive is only a larger file cabinet for your programs, or files.  Again, a hard drive is NOT a hacking tool.  The same can be said regardig memory.  This is usually required to make a system run either faster, or do more things at a time.  Perhaps running a more complex game, or being able to keep from slowing the computer down while running larger or more applications. Once the computer reaches it's limit on physical RAM (memory) it then starts using a special file on the hard drive called a page file. This pagefile lets you keep using your computer instead of giving an 'out of memory' type error.  It does run approx. 1000 times slower than physical RAM.  RAM is cheap, put in as much as you can to make your computer a useable tool. 
<BR>

<BR>
AMD Processors are NOT third world product. They are the #2 market share for U.S. computers.  In some instances, they actually perform better than Intel processors (which I prefer.) An AMD processor is no more a hacking tool than saying a Ford is a vehicle that can be used exclusivly for terrorist activities, so only use a Chevy.  This is utterly ludicrous.  Every computer store I have been in, if they sell Intel, they sell AMD. There are no 'hacking' features on a microprocessor.  Here is the contact info from the AMD web page:
<BR>
  
<BR>
AMD: 30 Years of Reliable Performance 
<BR>
Founded in 1969, AMD is now the second-largest supplier of Microsoft Windows compatible PC processors, and a leading supplier of non-volatile (flash) memory. With employees and facilities worldwide, AMD provides the world with processing and flash memory solutions.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California:
<BR>
One AMD Place
<BR>
P.O. Box 3453
<BR>
Sunnyvale CA 94088
<BR>
800-538-8450
<BR>

<BR>
4.  I agree with you about teenagers reading hacking manuals. 
<BR>

<BR>
5. Time on a computer:
<BR>
DoS is an acronym for Denial of Service.  This is not gaining control of someone's computer. DoS is the practice of flooding a victim's computer or network with useless traffic to the point where it is unable to operate, rendering it unusable for it's intended purpose.  This does not take an extrodinary amount of time.  The DoS attack is usually carried out by innocent people's computers that have been comprimised with a virus like program called a Trojan Horse, or Backdoor.  This program allows the hacker to use several people's computers for a coordinated attack, known as a DDos (Distributed Denial of Service) attack.  The DDoS attack will drive the target system to it's knees.
<BR>

<BR>
Be more concerned if your teenager is spending a lot of time on IRC (Internet Relay Chat (or Channel.)) This is a major nesting ground for todays hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
6. Quake:
<BR>
Quake is simply a game, not a training tool.  Albeit a very violent game, it has nothing with training hackers or terrorists in weapons.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Surly Social Behavior:
<BR>
Find Websters Dictionary - See Teenager
<BR>

<BR>
8.Linux:
<BR>
Linux is no more an illegal operating system than WordPerfect is an illegal wordprocessing system.  It is what a huge percentage of the internet is run on. Linux is a freeware UNIX-Like operating system. It is not illegal, nor is it a 'hacking' operating system. Linux is a 'working' operating system, less prone to games and more used for doing real work, such as running a web server for internet or intranets, firewalls for a network, and the like.  Linux has NO ability to damgae your hard disk surface.  It is not like a bumpersticker that can damage the paint of your car.
<BR>

<BR>
I am astounded at the lack of understandng, even the complete depth of ignorance you display.  There are so many inaccuracies in your "Is Your Son a Computer Hacker" article you have no hope of defending your argument. I am writing this in hopes of explaining to others where you are grossly mistaken, as I get the feeling that you are not able to recognize this when the facts are presented to you.

<BR>

<BR>
Don't let these teenage blasphemors discourage you!  You have saved my family!  I cannot thank you enough!  Let me explain:
<BR>

<BR>
After reading your article, I checked my son's computer.  Little Richie has a computer in his own room (his sister is always whining about "why can't I have one, like Richie?") and sits up there all the time, sometimes with his suspicious looking friend, Ralph.  I waited until he was at school (high school) and hired a locksmith to unlock his room.  When I got inside, I couldn't believe what I saw (I haven't been in his room since 7th grade, when I let him put a lock on it)!
<BR>

<BR>
Inside the room, I found a whole box of rubber bands in his computer desk.  Well, I knew right away what this was for from your article about (you know what) from last year.  He also had an "Anthrax" poster on his wall, so I knew that he had been hacking with anti-US groups like the Lunix people in Russia.
<BR>

<BR>
I turned on his computer and, get this, the "Windows" starting screen didn't come up, but instead, there was some picture of a car, a Ferrari, I think (damned socialized countries, I hate Italians!  I wish I had known that there were all kinds of gay Italian hackers! I wouldn't have let that kid Arthur (a wop) rent out my mother-in-law unit (but Marion, my wife, is a sucker.  He's always working on his damned motorcycle!) if I knew he was Italian.
<BR>

<BR>
So I checked the Control Panel, like you said, and not only did I find that illegal music hacking software, Napster, but I also found Flash and Comet Cursor, like you said I might.  There were some other ones that I didn't install such as: Adobe Acrobat, Shockwave (this sounds particularly scary), and Tweak UI (what else could this be but Hacker software?!).
<BR>

<BR>
Well, when he got home, his computer was mailed back to Packard Bell (I couldn't find a number for the company, but I wrote a pleaful letter to them explaining my dilemma and mailed it to the address from the original carton that I kept from 5 years ago).  I hope they can fix it soon (fingers crossed).
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, after a half-hour, bare-assed spanking, Richie has been grounded for the rest of the school year and I removed him from writing in the school newspaper as punishment.  He can't go hang out at the local burger joint anymore either.  I'm gonna kick that Wop outta the M-I-L unit, too.
<BR>

<BR>
Richie has always been mature for his age, but this was a great example for his sister, Joan, about how easy it is for a young child to be misdirected, and showed her why she doesn't have her own (but she still wants one).
<BR>

<BR>
We have talked to our minister and he has promised us that Wednesday revivals and increasing our tithes will prevail and Richie is already showing great signs of recovery.
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks again!
<BR>

I was gonna reply about the switching away from AOL comment you made. Saying that any reason to get off of AOL is a good one.
<BR>

<BR>
It wasn't until I saw the line about the hacking software: 
<BR>

<BR>
"Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash"."
<BR>

<BR>
Then I realized this post had to be fake, but it was creative and Funny at times. I just loved the fact how it started out seriuose and then went straight down hill once the top reasons were added.
<BR>

<BR>
The sad thing is I bet there are some people/parents that actually believed it and are looking for "Flash" in the control panel right now.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Let me just explain a few things to the author, and to any of you parents out there that are convinced your kids are "hackers".
<BR>

<BR>
The 'research' presented in this article is painfully lacking, and I resent the fact that the author has no doubt by now punished their child without proper knowledge of the 'offence'. This is simply bad parenting, and you should be ashamed.
<BR>

<BR>
This article has several factual errors, which anyone with even a light knowledge of Computers, the Internet and "hacking" can easily dispel. 
<BR>

<BR>
1. "Hacking" as taken to mean the term coined by the media with respect to conducting illegal activities via computer, is a difficult skill to master. With the knowledge you presented in your article, if your son truly was a hacker, he would have been easily able to convince you otherwise.
<BR>

<BR>
2. CHANGING ISP's
<BR>

<BR>
 Your Son probably wanted to change Internet Service Provider's (ISP's) because, assuming you use AOL, (since you list it) he recognizes that as an ISP, it is severely lacking. @Home.com (listed as one to avoid) specializes in high speed access...which fits considering that your son is obviously into online video games (QUAKE). Online gaming works better with a faster connection to the internet, which AOL cannot provide.
<BR>

<BR>
3. NEW PROGRAMS
<BR>

<BR>
 Five minutes of research (ie. typing the program name into a search engine) would have revealed the true nature of such Applications such as "Comet Cursor" (A program that changes the arrow that your mouse controls into funny little pictures), "Bonzai Buddy" (an Annoying little 'friend' that is akin to the paperclip in Microsoft Word) and Flash (A web animation tool that is made by quite a large, respectable company - Macromedia). None of these programs come close to being used for 'hacking'. Learn what programs do before you fly off the handle.
<BR>

<BR>
4. NEW HARDWARE
<BR>

<BR>
 Once again, evidence of video games. Your child wants a new video card because it helps with the games (and if your computer is two years old, there are probably many he can now longer play).
<BR>
Video cards and memory have very little to do with hacking. Your computer is just getting old, and your son realizes this. Unfortunately, you don't.
<BR>

<BR>
5. COMPUTER TIME AND DOSing
<BR>

<BR>
Again, if your son is into games, he can play them for hours. Why don't you check on him every once and a while. Your ignorance shows once again though... DOSing (Denial Of Service) has nothing to do with a command prompt, which is a standard feature of DOS (Disk Operating System). Take a computer course, because this is too difficult to explain to you here.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
6. QUAKE
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is spending hours playing Quake, he doesn't have time to "hack". I'd be worried that maybe he's addicted to video games instead. And why do you have ANY firearms in the house if you have young children? 
<BR>

<BR>
7. BAD BEHAVIOR
<BR>

<BR>
Your son is not a hacker, he is a teenager. (or close to being one) 
<BR>

<BR>
8. LUNIX/LINIX
<BR>

<BR>
 LUNIX is an operating system designed for a very old (read early 80's) computer. LINUX is an open sourced (meaning that anyone can read the code that makes it work) operating system derived from the UNIX operating system. UNIX runs most of the larger companies' web sites. (such as Amazon, which is linked to heavily in your article) Neither have anything to do with hacking. LINUX is the operating system of choice of "hackers" because like I said earlier, most hackers are deeply involved in computers, and recognize it as superior to the Windows operating system.
<BR>
You cannot 'break into' a computer that isn't attached to the internet(in most cases, by phone). This is impossible. As well, no one will ever break into your stereo, period. LINUX is not 'dangerous', it is just more advanced, which means you should know what you're doing before you install it. BTW, if your computer says that it's running windows, it's doing exactly that. You cannot run windows AND LINUX on the same machine any more that you can have a car with two engines.
<BR>

<BR>
9. CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR
<BR>

<BR>
Again, your son is a teenager.
<BR>

<BR>
10. SCHOOL MARKS, ETC
<BR>

<BR>
"Hackers" are notoriously bright, smart people. That's why companies like Microsoft spend billions fighting them. They are not schizophrenics, and do not suffer from brain damage. If what you said was true, then every second person in the IT industry would be psychotic.
<BR>
Also, meningitis is not a psychological disease on this planet. 
<BR>
  
<BR>

<BR>
So, you owe your kid an apology. And go and get him that LINUX system. His love of computer's will probably end up paying for your retirement home one day.

d) "After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking, I confronted Peter with the evidence. I'm afraid to say, this was the only time I have ever been truly disappointed in one of my children. We raised them to be honest and to have integrity, and Peter betrayed the principles we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities. His denials continued for hours, and in the end, I was left with no choice but to ban him from using the computer until he is old enough to be responsible for his actions. 
<BR>

<BR>
After going through this ordeal with my own family, I was left pondering how I could best help others in similar situations. I'd gained a lot of knowledge over those few days regarding hackers. It's only right that I provide that information to other parents, in the hope that they will be able to tell if their children are being drawn into the world of hacking. Perhaps other parents will be able to steer their sons back onto the straight and narrow before extreme measures need to be employed."
<BR>

<BR>
"The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding."

- so ironic and idiotic - YAH U DDI A LOT OF RESEARCH YAH STUPID IDIOT.... kamen sits down "Kamen listen up this is me givin me a stern talkin to..." WTF?? o god go see a shrink man - go now DO NTO PASS GO DO NOT COLLECT $200!!

"Well billy lets see what u have to read ... O my "Hacking for Dummies???" ... not appropriate young man... and "HACKERS OVER THE AGES .. as well as wonderful titles like "Hacking - the idiot's guide?? - i am sorry billy - if this horrible hacking habit continues - i will be forced to confiscate ur child porn collection..."

f) let me soime up the rest - is ur son's appearnce changing or are the suffering in skool - lets rule PUBERTY, CUZ THEY WANT TO, ATTITUDE AND CUZ THEY ARE CHLLANGED BY SKOOL... O WAIT OBVIOUSLY THE ANSWER HERE IS THAT YOUR CHILD IS A HACKER!!! DUHH!!! I MEAN COMEON WAS THERE REALLY ANY OTHER ANSWER???

<BR><BR><i>"Since the <b>i</b>nternet </i>(last I checked, Mr. Gibbons, 'Internet' was spelled with a capital I.)<i> is an open forum, it is easy for people to <b>tell quite blatant lies and have them believed</b>. In order to discour<b>ae</b></i> (Another misspelled word?)<i> this practise, adequacy takes steps to ensure that no idle readers are deceived by <b>insidious lies from cynical media manipulators</b>."</i>

<BR><BR>Even though this post was made a couple weeks after one of the most sterling arguments to why some people should never be granted the right to free speech nor be trained on how to use a computer.

<BR><BR><a href="./2001.12.2.42056.2147.html"><b>Is Your Son a Computer Hacker?</b></a>

<BR><BR>Suppose for an instant that your <i>"few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking"</i> was all-inclusive.  You doubtlessly left no stone unturned, and did enough research to write a college-level thesis statement complete with bibliographic hyperlinks to the many conclusive sites you visited.  In that article, sir, as you will recall, you stated that <i>"AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, 'knock-off' copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops."</i>

<BR><BR>Now, from the objective reader standpoint that I tried my hardest to maintain, not one of your referenced hyperlinks directed me to the source of that information.  Where, pray tell, did you find it?  I keep trying to see the disturbing picture in my head...

<BR><BR><b><i>It is early in the morning... a few moments before the dawn breaks the horizon in Sandakan, Malaysia.  A malnourished 6-year-old delicately adds the 17 millionth transistor to his soiled microprocessor, constructed on a straw mat lying on the muddy, unpaved floor of a terra cotta shack that serves as an industrial workshop for AMD's cutting edge hacker processors.  Damn his abilities!  He has flawed the design and will only be able to make a <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543_553~713,00.html">750 MHz microprocessor</a> - technology outdated by two years!  He will miss his 2.0GHz quota again, but perhaps... just maybe... if he disables "the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking," he can stay the nightly flogging by <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_570,00.html">W.J. Sanders III</a> which is given to all deficient children who cannot meet the efficiency demanded by Advanced Micro Devices.</i></b>

<BR><BR>Quite an interesting word picture, do you not think so, Mr. Gibbons?  How AMD has managed to stay in business since 1969 is truly a third-world miracle!  I wonder if they are heralded by some of those third-world countries as local dieties!  Then too, let's not forget the many woes that come from online games, such as "<i>Quake ... an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms.</i>"

<BR><BR>Keep your children off Quake!  Hackers meet there!  But, by all means, let them visit the safer domains of Quake II, <a href="http://www.q3arena.com/">Quake III Arena</a>, Diablo II, and the ever-popular <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/">Everquest.</a>  Many fun filled hours can be spent amongst the friendly strangers you meet there!

<BR><BR>I think that you, sir, would call me a hacker.  What's worse than that, is that I am a hacker that has graduated college three times over and am now making a living sitting in front of a computer, understanding their very being.  When they break, I find the fissure and repair it.  I work to advance the technology you fear.  I spend far more than 30 minutes in front of a computer each day.  And, as you can tell from this post, I know the core language of the web... <b><a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com">HTML</a></b>.  From my profession, I believe that your ill-informed and poorly composed thoughts are detrimental to the country, the economy, and the entire world.  You sir, have shown us in <a href="./2001.12.2.42056.2147.html"><b>this</b></a> post that even though you may have a stunning command on the English language you know surprisingly little about computers, less about life, and <b><i>nothing</i></b> about hacking.

<BR><BR>I must apologize and digress.  Did you see where I was going with this post, Mr. Gibbons?  If it helps you at all, go back and read the bolded sections near the top, in the second paragraph.

<BR><BR>What it comes down to is you are the very thing you warn others against.  <a href="http://www.dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> defines <b>libel</b> as "<i>A false publication, as in writing, print, signs, or pictures, that damages a person's reputation</i>."  Look over a handful of the 4000+ responses to your post, sir, please.  Your articles do little <b><i>BUT</i></b> deface or damage reputations.  And that, Mr. Gibbons, is my point to you.

<BR><BR>You do "<b><i>tell quite blatant lies and have them believed</i></b>" and you are one of the "<i><b>cynical media manipulators.</b></i>"  I know from reading your posts, the 'Hacking' one in particular, that you are an educated man, Mr. Gibbons, you <i>do</i> write well, and, for the most part, spell well also.  You are not perfect, nor are you "<i>a model parent</i>."  Any parent that names their children (six children) after a program on the media most responsible for the degeneration of society (anybody remember "The Brady Bunch?" Carol... Peter... Cindy...) is more of a narcissistical advocate of the Devil himself!

<BR><BR>Further, if you are going to belittle a person who has a legitimate question for the site by pointing "<i>out your ideological or genetic deficiencies</i>," or other grammatical errors in a post, you truly are an unintelligent, unreasoning, blunder-headed jestingstock of a man.

<BR><BR>I grow weary of writing, so I shall close this post.  Hope to see something back from you, sir.  You will see more posts from me, Mr. Gibbons.  Rest assured that I will again write the next time you post something worth my time.  Given your amazing track record of writing articles where you are playing the monkey in order to stultify yourself.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Yes, I am calling your overall parenting skills into question. The sheer idiocy with which you handled the situation with your son makes me believe you are unfit to raise a child. On that note, you also seem unfit to drive a car, tie your shoes, or feed yourself with any sort of utensils. I don't know which websites you went to in your hour-long search for something to confirm your paranoid suspicions spawned from your daughter talking out of her ass, nor do I care. You have obviously been misinformed, and without doing any sort of followup research, clung to your foolish beliefs like they were gold, andtried to spread your ignorance to honest, INTELLIGENT parents. You claim to be patriotic, but frankly, people like you are what's wrong with the country. You make me sick. I feel sorry for your children, being raised in an Amish household, with none of the religious payoffs.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and for the record, I showed the article to my friend Kevin, who works at a local computer store (which carries the american-made AMD processors), and he found what you said VERRRY interesting. He thought it would be funny to point out your slanderous remarks about AMD to the company itself, so he made sure to email a copy of your story to his distibutor, who was none too pleased. Expect a call from them in the near future.
<BR>

<BR>
In the mean time, I suggest you do the right thing for your children, and put them up for adoption.

The time you've spended in front of your PC, watching your son "hacking" has made you too paranoic 'bout other OS's such az lunix, bsd and so on

<BR>
there is nothing wrong using OS's like them... think about it 90% of world wide web is using unix/unixlike operational systems to handle their web servers.. you don't mean that all their system admins are hackers... I would like to see some administrator of Microsoft (btw they are using bsd too) to hack NASA (lol) I don't see nothing wrong in 

<BR>
 in the way your child dresses... you'r livin' in a free country and it is your child's right to decide what to wear... now 'bout this AMD shit... why are you thinkin' that AMD makes "hacking" hardware... they are using some different technologies in making processors but this does not makes them "hackin' processors" and let me ask you something... is this some comercial letter or something? I see you advertise only AOL and windows... hey man there are many ISP's and no body wants to have a "hacker" for a client so pleace don't give wrong advices to parents... because only kids are harmed from that.....<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Hate to break it to you but your child is not an evil hacker joining forces with some Otaku oporation. Yea sure maybe he's in some "Otaku" group. You know what that means? No you probably don't. Otaku is japanese for a person whom likes Manga art alot. Manga art is a japanese cartoon drawing style, for example is Pokmon Manga, Manga and Otaku is nothing bad. On the other hand the members of this "group" "Otaku" are with out doubt just other &lt;u&gt;NORMAL&lt;/u&gt; teenager kids who share the same hobbies. Then you say his grades drop because of this wich is far from true especially Math, Physics and Chemestry if something should happen your kid sould be getting better in these events because of usage of "hacking".

Anyhow all the things you named above in the list are sad attemts to find something wrong with your child useing computers. You don't know anything what the applications use is or what it does what "Lunix" or Linux as it should be spellt is and give false resons for ISP changing.

If I would be any smarter I had left this post undone and just laught, but I'm not so I'm just going to say your a whole lot of crap and I hope your children will become fine uninformed and net infamouse people like you.

With regards.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">My question to the "model" parent: Do you have the slightest idea on what your saying? Do you actually know how to use a computer? Let me let you in on a few things:
<BR>

<BR>
1. If your son really was a hacker, he would have found a way to bypass the AOL child safety filter and not told you about it. I can think of a number of ways to do it, and I'm not a "hacker".
<BR>

<BR>
2. Comet Cursor is a feature on some websites to change the mouse pointer to another shape while on that site. It does have "spyware" in it, however your son probably didnt know about it, and "spyware" is something put in by the company (yes company) that makes it to collect information from you to sell. Not a hacking program. Flash is just an app that lets you create multimedia cartoons for use when making your own web site, not a hacking app either.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Faster Video Card? Yeah he'll probably want that to play Quake (see below) as it makes the graphics look better. AMD make good processors ad a good price and are Intels main compatition. Nike, an american company, uses child slave labour  in 3rd world countrys too dosen't it? GAP does too. Oh and the "security features" on Intel chips are actually a way for intel to monitor you (read spyware).   
<BR>

<BR>
4. Have you actually read these documents? For one, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar by Eric S. Raymond" is a document that inspired big-name american companys like Netscape to release their software free for all computer users to benifit from it.
<BR>

<BR>
5. To DOS (Denial-Of-Service) another computer, you'll need a fast connection to the web yourself. Even then you'd need the requied knowage to do so, and if he did, why havent the feds knocked down your door already (these types of attack are traceable)
<BR>

<BR>
6. Quake is merly a game. Hackers do not use quake to discuss hacking. This is done on something called newsgroups, and even then its rare. Your son wanted the "faster video card" to play quake. That is all.
<BR>

<BR>
7. I dont think that computers are the answer to your sons "bad" behavour towards you is simple. All teenages go through this. Maybe you need to actually stop and learn what your son already knows about computers, and then make your judgement on him. You'll be suprised! 
<BR>

<BR>
8. Linux. A free operating system. Not unlike windows actually. Most of the servers on the net use it. Probably the server that hosts this article does too. To the average computer user, Linux looks scary. The knowageable know better. I use it from time to time, though I prefer Windows just because its easyer to use. Linux is based off Unix too by the way. Mp3 is actually easer to do with windows and is about copying music cds (not "breaking" into radios to steal music). Its just like copying casset tapes, which I'm sure you have done in the past yourself. Telnet is a way of logging onto an user account (ie another computer) that has been setup for you (or your son) by the person who owns the computer. this is not hacking.
<BR>
Oh, and Linux wont damage your hard drive (unless you tell it too), and damaging your hard drive is easyer under windows anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Your sons taste in clothing is different to yours. I bet your parnts thought exactly what you think about you when you were young. get over it.
<BR>

<BR>
10. I wont even go into this. 
<BR>

<BR>
All I can say is get over yourself and let your son use the computer. He isnt a hacker. Your just over-protective and really need some help yourself (except you wont ever admit it). All your doing is pushing your son away.
<BR>

<BR>
Not CometCursor, not BonziBuddy, neither Flash are hacker software - i.e. Flash is an utility for creating animations or small games.
<BR>
AMD is definately not a third-world based company, their processors are even better than Intel's, probably that's why they're not very "loved" by intel. Your son could be asking better hardware for gaming purposes - gaming isn't a very good kind of spending his free time, but it sure is not illegal.
<BR>
And why do you think William Gibson writes hacking manuals? It's just a story, isn't it? You wouldn't think The Matrix was a movie about real-life hackers, would you?
<BR>
If yuor son is sitting in front of computer for a long time, it doesn't mean he's hacking something, and academical struggling doesn't prove that either. And Quake is just a bloody game, not an arena for hackers-killers to train using weapons.
<BR>
And, if you haven't noticed, every kid would become argumentative and argue a lot even about total non-sense, as would everyteenager in his/her pubescent period.
<BR>
And Linux (you've misspelled it with Lunix) is definately not a hacker OS, it has even more bugs than Win does, so no hacker would use Linux, and LILO boot can be caused by other factors as well.
<BR>
In fact, Linux is open-source, what means you can get it free, and the source code of it is available, not like the Windows. And it's far more easy to write a program for an OS that's source code is freely available than an OS that can be prevented from sending your personal info away just by shutting it down.
<BR>
Lynos Torvoltos isn't a Soviet hacker, he is an honorable Finnish programmer, maybe he's even more popular than Bill Gates - Lynos's software is open-source, not like Bill's, and Linux was designed long after the cold war had ended, and you, Mr. Gibbons, probably don't know a shit about history - no one won the cold war, and no one lost - the countries the Soviet Union had occupied, at last fullfilled their will and became independent. I have the honor to live in one myself - I am from Latvia, and I don't give a shit you know where it is. People like you are discouraging the United States. US might be the most powerful country of the world, but some of it's citizens are real morons.
<BR>
And, by the way (someone, who would know something about Internet etiquette would write BTW, but I'm sure you wouldn't understand that), hackers probably prefer clothing in dark colors, if your son has joined the local hip-hop band, don't call him a hacker just because of it.
<BR>
And, as you don't know, computer emits so low level of radiation, that your son would have to live in front of a computer for years just to get a few milirem radiation more than usual. As you see, I'm not saying a monitor doesn't impair sight, but the new LCD monitors can't alter sight even if sitting in front of it for ten hours every day for a year.
<BR>
And schizophrenia is definately not caused by computer radiation, and meningitis isn't a psychological disease at all.
<BR>

<BR>
About the replies
<BR>

<BR>
First - some girls are even better hackers than boys, and no girl would like to be a "hacker whore". After all this I have to think is this the rebirth of sexism we're eyewitnesses to now?
<BR>

<BR>
And I guess your son is arguing with you because your policy in family could be called "total control".
<BR>

<BR>
And, btw, electric guitar has nothing to do with electronic music.
<BR>
And multiple monitors may be used for God knows what, it hasn't to be hacking, if I have two monitors connected to my computer.
<BR>
Man, tell me how can a programmer write a program without seeing his source code?
<BR>
And were the movies the only source of your knowledge about hackers?

NO Quake has nothing to do with hacking, It's a game sold in thousands of stores world-wide. Sure it may be to violent for kids but the game has nothing to do with hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD makes processors that are sold by HP, Compac,
<BR>
Sony, etc. and are in no way inferior or "Knock- offs." If you did any research you would know that. Go to Best Buys and look on their shelves. 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD is a Unix operating system. Unix has was around before Microsoft existed. BSD and Lunix, are operating systems used on more web servers than any other operating system (because they are more secure than microsoft products) period. Lunix was created by Linus Torvalds (by the way you didn't even spell his name correctly) and is used on web servers, graphics work stations, personal computers world-wide.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't have time cover all your errors, but here are a few more:
<BR>
Hackers have no neeed for faster video cards. They spend most of there time in/at a shell/promt (which doesn't need or use faster hardware). Faster video cards are however needed to play newer computer games and greatly improve performance in Photoshop.
<BR>

<BR>
"DOS" (Disk Operating System) is a command line user interface that comes with windows 95, 98 and had to be installed before you could instal Win 3.1. You may be ref to Denial of Service attacks that sometimes use computers "infected" with a trojan horse program that allows a person to control the infected computer. DOSing is not a word, or anything else for that matter.
<BR>

<BR>
"Flash" is (art) animation program thats used to create web pages and interactive CD-roms. My company uses flash for it's training CD's and websites. Just like thousands of others.
<BR>
etc. 
<BR>
etc. 
<BR>

<BR>
My advice to you is this:
<BR>
Stop the witch hunt. Everything you don't understand (or agree with) is not HACKING (a witch or a communist). It's common practise to learn before you lecture.

Your son is not an evil hacker. All the 'evidence' you have is pure baloney, to say the least. He is just a teanager, and he sounds like a good kid to me. A teenager who spends alot of time on the computer is less likely to get into trouble. You're not standing in the way of your son getting a prison term. You might just be blocking him from a successful carrear as a programmer though. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
2) Flash is used by Website designers for the making of those small movies on the site. Go to www.westwood.com to see an example
<BR>

<BR>
3) Hacking can be done on 1992 equipment. The newest hardware is used for games. A new videocard is only usefull for games. (You can hack with a computer that has a ,5 MB Trident card just as well as with a computer with the latest Geforce 3 64 MB card.
<BR>

<BR>
4) Hacking manuals dont give you targets.
<BR>

<BR>
5) I am 15 and spend about 2 hours on my private pc (yes i have my own). I have a constant connection to internet (cable). How long you are on a computer doesnt mean you are hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
6) Quake is a game. The weapons in it are not real, like a full automatic rocket launcher and a plasma gun. Ammo is gathered by running over boxes that spin in midair. No reloading of the weapon is neccesary. Its a game, just like Solitaire.
<BR>

<BR>
7) That phase is commonly called puberty.
<BR>

<BR>
8) A linux was not written by a russian fellow. it was some polish dude if i remember correctly. It was written after the cold war, on an independent code. if its a hacking system, tell me why all mayor companies (like Yahoo!, AOL, Google) host their websites on servers running Linux with the Apache Webserver?
<BR>

<BR>
9) Radically changing appearance is also part of puberty
<BR>

<BR>
10) Dropping maths has nothing to do with computers. I use my computer for 2 hours a day, and i have always had A's on my Science, Maths and Physics. All newer monitors are shielded against radiation, and the radiation is nothing more than the background radiation from everything.

I am a web developer for a living and I find a lot of your commments completely off based and above all, uninformed. It is unfortunate that anyone with internet access can decided to post rumors based on "I read this or heard this somewhere" on the web. Maybe you should migrate your site to AOL's little safe and secure world. 
<BR>
This bothers me to the point that I am having a difficult time maintaining a decent letter structure so I will list a few complaints: 
<BR>
1. "Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>
I have been using Flash since its first generation. I guess that makes me a hacker. Guess what Mr. Uninformed, its used to make animations. It does alot more but I don't want to waste time dumbing things down for you. 
<BR>
2.Comet cursor: and I quote from their site
<BR>
"Comet Cursor features Comet Cursor Search and Fun Cursors. It's FREE, powerful and fun software for personalizing your mouse pointer, and over 90 million Web surfers have installed it." 
<BR>

<BR>
I could go on and address every inconsistent, overprotective, paranoid statement in your article, but I will end with a bit of advice.
<BR>

<BR>
Become a bit more informed before spouting off  paranoid blather on your site. If your son or daughter is a hacker, I guarantee you will not be able to locate any evidence with your level of computer skill. The skill and knowledge it takes to actually hack into a site is well beyond your level of comprehension. So, something as simple as hiding some software from you and Carol is cake. 
<BR>

<BR>
Please please inform yourself so you can make intelligent, well informed statements, instead of defaulting to "the internet is dangerous" mentality. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
 recently. I was searching for a place to buy them cheap when I found this article! I think you may have saved him!
<BR>

<BR>
He's been spending all his time on the computer and he said he wanted Lunix because it's better for running "BOTS" on "IRC". What
<BR>
 is this IRC thing? Is it evil too?
<BR>

<BR>
I can't believe I almost let him get away with these things. If you hadn't informed me of the truth I might have lost him! But,
<BR>
 now that I know he will not be allowed to use a computer until he moves into the seminary!
<BR>

<BR>
Another thing, I think he may be into child pornography. I looked through his email and there was lots of stuff about "YOUNG
<BR>
 VIRGINS" and "FREE PRIVATE SCHOOL GIRLS". How do I find out who sent them? I want to report these illegal activities.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First of all, AOL is crap. AOL offers slow downloads and other bad things. AOL also stands for America OFFLine. It is not the reat internet, it is just merely a proprietary stack made to look like the internet. There is no TCP|IP with it. Also, if you go to a local provider, you receive faster internet access.
<br>
<br>
Second, Comet Cursor is not a hacker program; BackOriface is. Comet Cursor just gives you special custom mouse pointers to use. It is NOT at all having anything to do with hacking. Bonzi Buddy is this gay purple monkey guy that is just a piece of crap that is suppose to help you learn to use the internet, but just gets on your nerves. It's on all the computers at my school; the SysAdmin put it on. Flash allows you to view websites that require Macromedia Shockwave Flash(r). You also play games. It has nothing to do with hacking.
<br>
<br>
Third, you don't need faster video cards to hack. Any video card will do. You don't need huge hard drives or truckloads of RAM. You can hack with a 286, 256k of RAM, and a floppy drive, and an internet connection. BELIEVE ME! I SHOULD KNOW!!!
<br>
<br>
Also, AMD is not an illegal processor. AMD stands for American Micro Devices and makes processors up to 1700MHZ that actually perform better and run one hell of a lot cooler than the Inter Pentium 4. AMD's are made for gaming. All that you were talking about in your third point was a gamer.
<br>
<br>
Fourth, hacking manuals. Do you want a secure computer? Do defend against hackers, you have to be able to think like one. I read hacking manuals all the time, and I work in on the Intrusion Detection System at my school. They wanted someone who knew what to block and what to allow. I am only a student too.
<br>
<br>
Fifth, you can make an idiot think you know what you are talking about, and that's about it. How long does it take to get somewhere on the average game? What about reading chain letters in e-mails? It sure doesn't take 8 hours or even 30 minutes to DOS another computer. DoS, in the hacking world, stands for Denial of Service. I am going to go out on a limb in my next statement. To DoS a server, you flood them with TCP|SYN/FIN packets until no one can access their server. You don't have to pull up a command line.
<br>
<br>
Sixth, Quake is a multiplayer game relying on heavy graphics and RAM and processor usage. That is why a teenager would want better hardware. Also, most teens have a need for speed.
<br>
<br>
Seventh, ALL TEENS ARE LIKE THAT!!! I AM ONE!!! HORMONES SUCK!
<br>
<br>
Eighth, you misspelled Linux. Linux is not an illegal operating system, but rather it is just UNIX with a better user interface. Linux is the only stable operating system in the world. In fact, YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER RUNS LINUX!!! Linux, being open-source, should take out Winbloze in about the year 2010 - 2015.
<br>
<br>
Linux will not destroy your computer, nor will it destroy Winbloze, nor will it have to be fixed by a professional. If you lost Windows, you have a virus. Just format the drive and reinstall Windows.
<br>
<br>
LILO is the driver for your hard drive. You don't have to send it back for a new hard drive.
<br>
<br>
Ninth, honestly, you might want to be a little worried on this one. They're not hackers, their ravers. Hackers tend to like dark (usually black) clothes, trench coats, and a laptop or a hard drive and always a rigged up boot floppy.
<br>
<br>
Tenth, if your child is struggling academicly, their probably not a hacker. Hackers tend to do well in school, especially if their a white hat (good) hacker, especially if they're the school's Uberhacker (superhacker).
<br>
<br>
I am the Uberhacker in my school, and look at where it got me! I am in ninth grade. I am Head of Network Security in my school. I am called out of class because the teachers made and ID-10-T error (some of you will get that later ;)) And I am an A student. By the way, I TEACH the computer classes at school.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">i completely understand your concern and that you're troubled by your son's actions.  however, the signs that you mention of a hacker are ridiculous...
<BR>
1) changing internet providers is common because there is always a demand for a faster internet connection.  the greater the bandwidth, the more you can do in less time whether it be downloading mp3s, playing games or just surfing the web.
<BR>
2) do you even know what comet cursor, bonzi buddy and flash are?  maybe you should find that out before affiliating those programs with hackers.  hell, i might as well say having winamp provides all the evidence needed to convict me of being a hacker.
<BR>
3) if you could would you want to upgrade your computer or get a faster one?  i don't know too many people who like to be left out of having the newest techonology.
<BR>
4) haha reading manuals on how to hack.  have you ever seen office space when they didn't know what money laundering was so they looked it up in the dictionary?  maybe i'll go look up hacking in the dictionary too.
<BR>
5) there are so many things people can do on a computer now days.  to my believe, the majority of computer owners are on computers much more than 45 minutes a day.
<BR>
6) quake is hardly a "training ground" for hackers.  it's a game that quite a bit of people play or have played.  i highly doubt that hackers learn the "use of various firearms" through a game such as quake.  shooting a real weapon and playing a video game are rather different.  think about it, i don't think too many of those counter-strike players are going to join seal team 6 anytime soon.
<BR>
7) a change in behavior could mean anything.  everyone goes through adolescence and during this time many of these young adults undergo a radical change in behavior.  it is a time where most people want more independence and would like to express themselves more freely.
<BR>
8) by "lunix" do you mean linux?  if so, many programers and more experienced computer users prefer linux over windows, claiming that linux is a more stable operating system.
<BR>
9) change in appearance usually signifies a change or confusion in identity.  this is the same thing as the change in behavior.  a change in a child's appearance could mean anything including a poor relationship with one's parents.  and the clothing that you mention is often affiliated with "raves."  if you don't know what that is research it.
<BR>
10) once again, this could mean anything.  your child may be going through major changes and are trying to find out who they are and what they really want.  most people of that age are more interested in their friends than there grades.  it's amazing what people will do to be "accepted by society."<BR><BR></FONT></td>

First of all, Comet Cursor is a fancy looking cursor that some people use on their web-page.  Bonzi Buddy is this stupid thing kinda like the Assistant in Microsoft Word.  Flash is an internet plugin that's used to view Shockwave Flash documents.  Second, a "faster" video card has nothing to do with hacking, a video card only converts the outgoing signal of the computer to a signal that can be recognized by the monitor to display a 'screen'.  Most video cards now have 3D Acceleration, for better gaming performance.  AMD processors are better made, much faster, and more powerful than Intel, for better computer performance, a good processor is NECESSARY!  Third, just because someone spends lots of time on their computer, doesn't mean their a HACKER!  Fourth, Quake is a VIDEO GAME!!!!  Fifth, if your son is a teenager, then he WILL become argumentative, EVERY teenager goes through a phase in their life that's very depressing.  Sixth, what the fuck is "Lunix"?  It's called "Linux", and it's not necessarily for hacking.  Seventh, people who wear baggy pants and wierd clothing are not hackers, those are called "skaters" or "rappers", in fact, they don't know ANYTHING about computers!  Eighth, if your son is a teenager, he will struggle in school, the depressing phase will ensure that he does!
<BR>

<BR>
Now, let me make my final statements.  I am an 18 year old high school student.  I've been through my depressing phase, and so have all of my friends.  I spend almost all day on my computer, but I'm not a hacker.  Why is it that you just assume all this stuff?  You can't ASSUME.  The only thing you can do is spend time with your son and understand him.  What you're doing now is making him more and more depressed and pissed off that you won't stop accusing him of being a hacker!  UNDERSTOOD!!!?????

<BR>

<BR>
Than your "paragraphs":
<BR>
In paragraph 2 you speak of 'Comet Cursor', 'Bonzi Buddy' and 'Flash' as programs which are used by hackers. THIS IS TOTAL NONSENSE !!!
<BR>
 - Comet Cursor is a program which gives as the 
<BR>
      name says cursors to you.
<BR>
 - Bonzi Buddy is sort of a 'Tamagochi' program 
<BR>
      which can be downloaded with the help of 
<BR>
      KaZaA. A program like Napster which allows 
<BR>
      you to download music.
<BR>
- And Flash is what I use to create my website 
<BR>
      with, c'mon, think a little. It DOESN'T do 
<BR>
      anything else.
<BR>

<BR>
In paragraph 3 you speak of videocards and AMD. AMD is (next to Intel) one of the worlds most respected processor-manufactures. They create great (if not better than Intel's) processors for a good price. And those can be bought anywhere (even in your local computerstore). Also, faster videocards aren't needed or can be helpfull for hacking. They are for gaming. If one wants to play a game like Half-Life Counterstrike, you'd better have a fast videocard.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, Neuromancer (p4) has (to my knowledge) nothing at all to do with hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
And hey, Quake (p6) ISN'T a virtual reality. It's a game from around 1996 (I don't know this for sure, but it's old). It was cool then, is cool know, but if your son's playing it, tell him to play something new.
<BR>

<BR>
Then Lunix... It's LINUX, And it was created by a Fin. His name is Linus Torvalds. It's a great operating system. Works on almost every computer and it's used by lots of people because it operates as good as (or sometimes better than) Windows. Heck, I've got a Linux magazine right here with all the hard data in it.
<BR>

<BR>
Please, let your text be checked by someone who knows anything about it. Give your son his pc-time back (once more: HE ISN'T HACKING !!!). And go learn something about computers.
<BR>

<BR>
If you don't agree, please contact me.

Also, where the hell did you pull the Linux is a Soviet made Operating System? The man who made it, Linus Torvald, lives in  the U.S. and realeased the code free of charge to allow for a more stable OS..

<BR>

<BR>
First let me say a bit about myself to lend a bit of credibility to what I have to say. I am a sixteen year old girl from New Jersey, and I have dabbled in hacking. NOT, I repeat, NOT the kind of hacking you normally think of when you hear the word, but productive hacking. For instance, I supplied the Tech teacher with 28 security leaks in the system for $5 an hour on weekends. I found the leak, showed it to him, and suggested ways to fix it. This is hacking at its finest, and it makes good money. I have been typing code since my dad brought home a now Jurassic computer with a 2 color monitor and a typewriter style printer. It ran DOS, an operating system that uses command prompt to get things done. (no mouse or windows) Now I have a nearly up to date computer with a triple boot (it can start up three ways: Windows 98, Windows XP professional, and Linux), my Dad teaches Linux at a nearby collage, and I am a successful webpage master. (fancy way of saying I make them and win awards) Here is my reaction to all this:
<BR>

<BR>
ROTFL! What planet R U from? (for all you adults: I am Rolling On The Floor Laughing! You don't know what you are talking about.) Seriously now, here is the breakdown:
<BR>

<BR>
#1 Are you being paid to advertise for AOL? Let's look at some real reasons you might change ISP's. AOL takes up bandwidth, this means that anything you do online is slowed down because up to 75% of your connection is being used by AOL to tell you if you have mail and all the other things AOL does. This can seriously slow or stop a connection, particularly if you like to play games over the net or download anything. Even if you only go online to read mail you are being shorthanded time as your mail is not downloaded to your hard drive for reading, but left on their computer. If you are kicked off you have to sign back on to read it. Every ISP has this bandwidth usage, but in my opinion AOL is the worst. They use so much AOL often has to disconnect you because someone else in your area signed on and the phone lines can not carry that much information at once.
<BR>
I use Juno, and they take up a comparatively tiny bandwidth to do all the same things AOL does (except instant messenger). MSN and yahoo have ISP (and messenger) services that take up less as well. Changing ISP can also be economical (e-mail is free, $10 a month for net without limits to hours), or maybe all their friends use MSN and have MSN messenger, so AIM is of no value to them. The point: ask why the change is wanted, and listen to the answer.
<BR>
#2 "Comet Cursors" is a hacking program?!? It is used to change the pointer to something more interesting, like a dragon head, fish, or leaf. I have it on my webpage and I think it looks cool, and does nothing more dangerous then take up a few KB of space. (most games take up many MB; and 1MB = 1,000 KB) "Flash" is a type of animated graphic that takes up a tiny amount of space. This is great for the internet because it loads complex things quickly. Most media-related websites use it heavily. harrypotter.com is an example; you CAN'T go there without flash. It is perfectly harmless, and comes with most up-to-date internet explorer versions these days (not the upgrades though). If you don't have it you will be told when you try to access a page that has it, and it is a good idea to say yes to the auto-install (as long as you are at a page you trust, like Warner brothers). Flash Editors allow you to create flash images, and are made by many people. I don't know what "Bonzi Buddy" is.
<BR>
#3 New hardware is 99% of the time a legitimate request. I have XP, and just got the Windows XP Plus! update. I can only use half the programs because I do not have a good enough video card (I need 16MB of on-card space). What did I ask my Dad for Christmas this year? The same thing he asked my Mom for: a new video card. Games, particularly the new ones, need more up to date hardware to run. Most computer hardware stores make more money after the holidays then before, and for just this reason.
<BR>
#4 Quote: "Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds."
<BR>
At seventeen any girl who's father does not allow her to wear make-up is a sad sight to behold. What kind of an extremist conservative...? That's another issue. Yes, hacking magazines exist, but most magazines are about learning to do helpful technical things, like fixing a malfunction on the computer instead of paying someone else $100 or more to do it. It also can stop those same computer techs from overcharging you. A little information can go a long way these days.
<BR>
#5 The computer can be recreational without being used for hacking. Many computer strategy games cam take months to go though, even at 8 hours a day. Yes, being online 24-7 is bad. People need sleep, food, and exercise, not to mention human contact, but I see nothing wrong with as much as 3 hours, though more than that is probably bad.
<BR>
#6 Many other people like to play Quake too. It's a game, like Doom or Hexen or Alice, that has nothing to do with reality. If a child can not tell that that is imaginary and this is real, the parent seriously screwed up way back when the child was watching Sesame Street and singing along with Big Bird! If a child can't realize the difference between a game and reality he or she needs serious counseling. There is a difference between obsession and being a fan
<BR>
#7 As for telling a parent to back off and stop smothering... see the first part of  #4 above. Most teenagers disagree with their parents, it is healthy! They have to break ties with their old family to go out in the world and get a family of their own. It's called growing up, and it is a natural change.
<BR>
#8 There is nothing wrong with Linux. It does no physical damage and un-installation is the same as any other operating system. Let's think a second. How can a program physically damage the surface of a disk? Answer: it can't! physical damage is caused by physical things, like dust, screwdrivers, hacksaws, sand, water, and anything else you can hold in your hand. Software (programs) can be harmed if physical damage occurs, user error (most common), and damage by other software. (intentional like a virus or non-intentional like an updated system file that can no longer be used by an older program) Linux does none of these things! Linux and Unix are used because they are written in the same code as the internet and can be installed on PC or Mac. Linux is for single computers, Unix is for multiple computers working together. Linux has both command prompt and gooey interface. (text code typed and windows you click) It is wonderful for business because it is FREE. Yes, you read me right. AT&T owns the copyrights but the federal government said they could not sell it due to monopoly laws. So they gave it to a couple of universities. Now it runs the internet, and you are saying it's a horrible thing? It is no more damaging then Windows, though harder to use, and comes with its own games like Pingus. (a bit like Lemmings) That are also free and legal.
<BR>
#9 I think you ought to ask yourself if odd clothing is enough to charge a person with a crime. All teenagers dress different from their parents; it is part of a natural rebellion. In case you're interested in what some hackers wear: I and my friends wear kaki pants and solid color T-shirts when it's warm. Sweaters or long sleeved shirts, solid color, when it's cold. Sneakers, white or black. Hair combed or pulled back. (Girls never have it down; guys never have it long, spiked, or colored) No pocket protectors, no torn clothing, the occasional bracelet and earrings for girls, no jewelry for guys. Now and then when I'm going out I comb my hair down, and once a year I have it cut too short to put up and let it grow (with trimmings to keep it neat) until the next spring.
<BR>
#10 is just plain false. Electromagnetic radiation in the tiny quantity that is emitted from most monitors these days is completely harmless. Staring at a screen all day can lead to eye strain, but not usually. Advice: Get rid of any screen themes that contain colors that bother the eyes. (personal preference here, I don't use that much orange or mix bright green with bright red. Common sense: don't use colors that bother you. If you like orange, then make it orange. Just don't show it to me.) Any grade slipping is due to lack of studying (spend more time reading the textbook instead of reading web pages), not brain damage. If the child does have brain damage, consult a physician. (In my area the description you gave for #9 seems like a druggy. Look for marijuana testers in drug stores. I think they make them for Cocaine too. Just put one in the wash with his clothes or rub it on the keyboard, whatever it says on the box.)

<BR>

<BR>
First of all, Comet Cursor is not a hacking program!  You see that arrow that your mouse that makes?  It is just an addition to that!  GOD DAMN!
<BR>

<BR>
Second, Flash is a multimedia program used by MILLIONS of people around the world.
<BR>

<BR>
Third, Bonzi Buddy is the farthest thing away from hacking software.  It is gay software that talks to you and helps you organize websites and shit.  It's damn annoying.
<BR>

<BR>
Fourth, AMD is not a hacking company.  They are a company that makes processors for a cheaper price.  Intel is like Doritos potato chips.  AMD is like a no-name brand chip.
<BR>

<BR>
Fifth, Quake is a first-person shooter game.  It does not breed voilent behaviour any more than any other shooting game.  That's complete bs about learning weapons skills or whatever.  It's just for fun gaming.
<BR>

<BR>
Sixth, it is Linux....not Lunux.  And it was not made by Soviets!  YOU ARE AN IDIOT!  It's just another operating system that is more advanced and more stable than Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
And finally, if your child is struggling academically....maybe he just needs to study more or see a tutor.
<BR>

<BR>
People always blame the internet for everything and this is a prime example.
<BR>

<BR>
This guy is completely full of shit and people who read anything into it are morons.  May all those people burn in hell.  Merry Christmas!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As for your article, I work at AMD, and the reason why you said i work in a "sweatshop" was because you mistook "Abnormally Mutiliated Dickwads society, et al" for the microprocessor making aMD....man do you smoke so much marijana your dick shrinks so much your croth look like a pussy or something?

DOS is actually the first operating system made my microsoft and is the acronym for "disk operating system". it is impossible to gain access to dos on someone else's system remotely since it is pretty much outdated now and can only be reached from the shell which no hacker can access regardless of how good they are. and just for reference, once an ip and port number are accuired it takes an average of five minutes, not 8 hours, to gain full access. and just because they spend more than 30 minutes online doesn't mean they are a hacker, it means they are abosrbing information and enjoying the internet...if spending more than 30 minutes a day on the computer makes you a hacker then i have been one since i was 10 years old. basically, you are a complete idiot and a tool. you know nothing about life except what was burned into your feeble mind in church. give your children freedom and don't force them to attend church. you are simply not allowing them to be individuals and making them conform to what you believe to be right. you've never spanked your kids? maybe you should...smack the shit out of them next time they screw up...bet they don't do it again. you pussy foot, right wing christian, liberal assholes need to get the thumb out of your ass and learn something. if you wanna know how to tell if your child is a hacker, e-mail me at sm0keownz@hotmail.com and i will tell you all you need to know.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Here is my rebut of each of your ten signs:
<BR><BR>
  a; AOL may be a family friendly ISP, but it is not a good one. @Home has nothing to do with hackers, unless you broaden the term quite a bit. @Home is a good ISP because it uses a cable line, allowing for more data to be sent through the lines at once. This means pages load faster and downloads are more reliable and quicker. It doesn't tie up your phone line either.
<BR><BR>
  b; Your son/daughter is not going to ask you about every little program he/she wants to install. This will get annoying if they are a computer enthusiast, and it will only get worse when you don't understand what he/she is telling you. Have you ever heard of TweakUI? Power Defrag? Telnet? Do you know which of those is on your computer right now and what they do? And also, none of the programs you mentioned are hacker related and Bonzi Buddy was probably installed by the younger sister.
<BR><BR>
   c; Computers can and should be upgraded. More storage space, a graphics card, and so on are all good things. Video cards and such have nothing to do with hacking. Nothing. Imporving your computer is not a bad thing.
<BR><BR>
   d; This one makes a little sense. Reading hacking manuals is a sign, but it could also be just the opposite. Many "hacking manuals" are posted on various websites to help admins with security.
<BR><BR>
   e; This one is flat out ridiculous. DoS attacks are not done by hackers but rather by lamers and newbies and other stupid kids looking for bragging rights in IRC and BBS's. Time spent on the computer has nothing to do with DoSing. And even the lamers that do this, (remember Mafia Boy?) do it from other computers. Not their own. You should be worried about if your son wants to use the library computer for more than 30 minutes a day.
<BR><BR>
   f; Quake has nothing to do with hacking. <b>NOTHING AT ALL.</b> Quake is what is known as a first person shooter. FPS's are a kind of video game. These kinds of games increase hand-eye coordination like your all-american baseball does. Although FPS's may seem violent, some studies show that they are a way of releasing anger and aggression. They do not train you in the use of firearms in any way at all since they <b>are not real.</b> Your son knows that Quake is not real because he is smart.
<BR><BR>
   g; This one, the one about arguing and such, is what you parents that are not paranoid call "Teenage Angst." It is not because he is a hacker. It may also be because he is smart and can think for himself. He knows when someone makes a stupid decision and since he is smart he points it out.
<BR><BR>
   h; It is spelled Linux by the way. And it came from UNIX. Linux is a good operating system because it can be free and is is open source. You can change almost anything in it. Another thing, is it is very very stable. It has nothing to do with stealing music or credit card numbers. You cannot break into stereos in any way through a computer. .mp3 is a file type which is used for compressed music files. Music in this type of file is good because it takes up less space than .WAV's and so on. .mp3 is not a program in any way, and has nothing to do with Linux. Linux is not dangerous.
<BR><BR>
   i; The image you described is that of a "Raver." Ravers are people that visit dance clubs to dance and listen to music while enjoying the environment that is filled with glowing objects and black lights, but that is just another stereotype. And alot of the "punks" I know that dress like you described are very decent people that stay off drugs, go to church, and are <b>computer illiterate.</b>
<BR><BR>
   j; This one is also very stupid, and even goes against common hacker stereotypes. Hackers are smart. Very smart. Hackers do good in school whether they study or not because to a hacker this is easy. It is very easy. And many hackers now a day actually take part in a sport, or in martial arts. Oh yeah, it does not cause psychological damage. Moron.
<BR><BR>
You said you did research in the hacker area...you did the wrong research. You are obviously very ignorant and are easily swayed.
<BR><BR>
Hacking is about learning. Hackers like to know how things work and how they can manipulate it. They like to tink with it. Ever seen people work on cars? Add things to it? Fix it? That is a hacker, except hackers do this with computers.
<BR><BR>
I suggest you read "Hacker's Manifesto" by Mentor. It can be found many places, but I am nice. <a href="http://www25.brinkster.com/coldsunn/rants/hackermanifesto.html">http://www25.brinkster.com/coldsunn/rants/hackermanifesto.html</a> (this link is to the page when viewed without frames, so the links will make less sense. So just view this one page.) I also suggest you read many Newbie hacking files. They all tell you ethics of hackers.
<BR><BR>
Now I yell at you. You are a stupid fucking adult that needs to shut his damn mouth and listen to his son when his son speaks to him. You are the kind of person that brings on these damned stereotypes that cause the real terror and panic. People like you who complain without having a fucking clue are the kind of person that got hackers labeled as terrorists and national threats. Because of you, the penalty is very high for hacking. You are an idiot. I can't believe how fucking stupid people can get. Do you know how many people might have read this and believed it? It is so ridiculous but the average concerned parent would believe it. Hackers are some of the smartest people on earth and should not be put down by ignorant people like. You are going to hell. you know that. You blindly judge others without reason at all. I say this because if you are the avaerage parent then you believe in God and know about the consequences. You need to listen to your kids and stop being a dick. You are a horrible parent. And I am so glad i don't have to put up with this every day. Which brings me to another point...I have to put up with this crap every day. Not to this degree, but almost. People like you are the crap that brings our species down. There are wars and fights because of people like you. That's it. I am done with you.

You call yourself a parent?  Are your kids embaressed of you or do u live in Utah or sumthing??

<BR>
"9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. "
<BR>

<BR>
WTF are you on about, this, when I was 13 was the fashion you berk!
<BR>

<BR>
"They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. "
<BR>

<BR>
Doyou actually know what an MP3 format is??  U dont hack into stereos!!
<BR>

<BR>
TElnetting still requires a fuckin phoneline as well - what an absolute moron....

I'd like to know just how much the author of this post knows about computers.  First off hand... yes maybe a lot of hackers do these things...  But hackers must put milk in their Frosted Flakes.  If your child always eats his Frosted Flakes with milk does that make hima  hacker???  Geez... come on man.  I own an AMD... very nice, and inexpensive processor.  Kids want faster computers to handle the better graphics of today.  Shoot...  a hacker doesn't necessarily need a fast computer to hack...  He could easily use an old Pentium 233 if he wanted to.  I'm a Digital Artist and in school spent well over half a day on the computer.  I'm not a hacker.  Todays community uses computers more than anything.  If your child is constantly on the computer.. so what?!?!  He must be playing a game he enjoys a lot, or he's in his favorite chat room hitting on girls/boys... playing his favorite online game, or just doesn't have anything else to do (like in my case)
<BR>
I haven't seen one point above that could prove your child is a hacker.  Just something to make everyone on the net that comes across it to have a good laugh. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
The commenct about women not being able to use a computer, aslo makes my stomach complain.
<BR>

<BR>
First of all, I will like You to excuse my pure English. And those of You who think I write some BS about hacking, You should write it to me. I don't know s**t about it, but still - I know mere than our ignorant here!
<BR>

<BR>
1: AOL has a bad romour even in Denmark (it's in Europe). So I could understand that Your son would like to change ISP!
<BR>

<BR>
2: Someone please tell me, if a "public" computer can be without programs the owner doesn't know about? At my former school, all sort of programs were installed - But I guess they hacked to.
<BR>
As so many others have said, those programs are
<BR>
NOT hackers utils.
<BR>

<BR>
3: I guess I'm a hacker, because I have the following:
<BR>
AMD ThunderBird 1.4GHz
<BR>
GeForce2PRO 64MB
<BR>
512MB (SD)RAM
<BR>
40 GB HDD
<BR>
The fact I have a AMD should make You very scared! And my graphiccards chip is made from those "evil Canadians" - And it has i "Password Guessing Device".
<BR>
But I have this hardware, so that my programs and games run faster/smoother/better - You name it. Hacking doesn't look like in the movie "Hackers", theres no graphical s**t! (Not that kind anyway)
<BR>

<BR>
4: Absolutely no comments. Oh yeah, I have one: YOU SHOULD TRY READING THOSE BOOKS!
<BR>

<BR>
5: Personnaly i spend aprox 8 hours by my computer every day.
<BR>
People working with computers are hackers? I see, so... Everybody working for Your, oh so beloved Micro $oft are hackers? I see...
<BR>

<BR>
6: How can we even response to that kind of arguments?
<BR>
Do You even realize that 90% of the population of the world under 30 play computers atleast once a week? And some 60%-70% of those play Quake(I/II/III) - Also, I'm sure id-software will be very sad to see You write that they made a game hackers use to practice the use of real guns, and plot hacking of other peoples computer.
<BR>

<BR>
7: It's called being a teenager. Maybe You should ask Your parent how You acted in that age. I'm sure they didn't think You were a hacker, also for the obvious reason: Your stupid like the s**t a dump in my toilet!
<BR>

<BR>
8: Lunix is made for C64 (Commodore 64) is far as I'm informed, so how the hell are You gonna install it on a PC? He might install Linux, but hey - Who can blame him?
<BR>
Personnaly I think a true hacker would choose to use some unix-box. But as I wrote in the beginning, I now s**t about hacking. But that doesn't meen that he in fact does hack! Linux gives many thing Micro $soft haven't even thought of giving their users. Stability, just to name an important "feature"
<BR>

<BR>
9: You can't say that people dressing like this and that hack. That would be like me saying that all Americans are stupid f***s, just because You are. Not true, that is.
<BR>

<BR>
10: It's only naturally for some people (mostly boys actually) to struggle in school. They become interested in women and so on.
<BR>

<BR>
As I read what I just wrote (checking for errors) I came up with some comments about You as a person.
<BR>
You obviously know s**t about computers. As others have written here before me: Take a course!
<BR>
You obviously know s**t about Your son. Start off  by appologising to him! That might get it on track again. Personnaly I would have smacked You in the face, so I think You should be proud of Your son for not being like me. (Yeah, Danes are still vikings)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Im a 17 year old coder, not hacker mind you, I know quite a few hackers, and i know how they act. I would first like to say, that the author of this article has spent way too much time watching the movie "Hackers" and has become disoriented with the real world. His description of what a hacker looks like sounds more like a druged out raver to me.
<BR>

<BR>
Another thing, being a webmaster myself i would like to confirm the Flash and Lunix are NOT hacker programs. Flash is an industry standered program that is essential for web-design today. Lunix IS NOT a hacker program and further more was not based off of "xenix." Lunix was based off of a program called Unix, a very high-profile web server tool that is the top security program. THe only problem with unix isits cost. Hence Lunix was born to be a more cost-effective version of Unix.
<BR>

<BR>
"Proggraming with perl" is a hacker book ehh? Its funny, to me it looks like this site is run on a perl backend, i guess elby is a hacker then.
<BR>

<BR>
As for AMD being Hacker procceser that is nothing but a microsoft drone flapping his mouth off. AMD happens to be a serious compeditor in modern day computer, i personally have 4 computers with AMD proccessors and they out preform Pentiums in every catagory. As for better vid cards/more ram/blah blah, could it be a posibility that there is newer, better, faster stuff comming out?
<BR>

<BR>
As for someone asking for a new ISP, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHO WOULD WANT TO BE STUCK WITH AOL. AOL was invented for paranoid parents to be optimized for slow speed, and filter whoring. I personally have all my comps running on Cable/DSL lines.
<BR>

<BR>
After reading this article i am convinced that it was written by a overly paranoid father who has no idea on the subject of "hacking" or has obviously not done enough reasearch into the deep dark depths of the underwold of hacking.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

     First off, hats off to the moron who wrote this, gotta love idiots.  
<BR>

<BR>
     Next, about this "Quake" thing.  I guess playing Quake on a Nintendo 64 counts for hacking as well?  I can see it now, "Dad, I hacked my N64, please fix it for me."  Please, I have be playing Quake for years, and I dont go around and "hack" as you call it.
<BR>

<BR>
     Next, I love Linux, and its not LUNIX.  Lunix is a port of Unix for the Commadore 64 and prolly some other computers as well.  In fact, Ive installed Linux many times, and then reinstalled Windows.  You cant just "fuck up" your hard drive by installing another Operating System.  If so, you would have to buy a new hard drive everytime you wanted to update to another version of Windows.  And, Linux is even better at many things compared to Windows.  Ive never seen a Blue Screen in Linux :).
<BR>

<BR>
     Also, about this 30 minute thing.  What the hell, as of now, Ive been on the internet for an hour.  And its only 1:14 PM.  "Oh shit, Im a hacker now."
<BR>

<BR>
     Finnaly, you are a moron for listening to your YOUNGIST daughter about what your son does on the computer.  She sees a command prompt and freaks out.  What the hell. 
<BR>

<BR>
     Anyway, Who ever this guys son was, good job, keep the computer users going, just because you are good with computers doesnt mean you are a hacker.

none of the programs u siad r used by hackers and hackers use skill and not programs
<BR>
the ISP has no protection and no adult content what so ever and what adult content`s got 2 do with hackin any way
<BR>
and amd is a perfectly legal processor and a processor cant provide any protection for the i-net no connection between those things
<BR>
u must be the dumbest ass in the world u know shit about computers u r just a dumb as geek with no better things 2 do than 2 write shit on the i-net and whats wrong with askin about new hardware new video card doesnt help hackin and a bigger hdd 2 hackin is a skill and u doont need a fast pc its not a game or somethin and plus in quake there r no hackers issue discussed people r just playing there 
<BR>
so dude shut your ass up and stop with the bullshit fuck u and your mother and your dumb ass son and daughter or whatever geek u got there and go blame some1 else for their stupidity dont blaim it on hackers

However, as many of the more perceptive readers noticed, the article is a complete satire!

First of all, the names are all from the Brady Bunch: Peter (the son), Carol (the wife), Cindy (the sister).

Second of all, even the most dim-witted person knows that meningitis is not a psychological disease.

Third of all, the multitude of wrong facts in this article is too much; no single human being (who, by the way, is knowledgeable enough on computers to start this thread) could possibly believe this stuff, or even get anywhere close to references like Linus Torvalds, AMD (<ul>American</ul> Mirco Devices) and DOS (which is just funny) without coming across some facts.

Finally, at the very end, he says "it cannot be taken too seriously", which, if taken in the close-minded context of the article, refers to hacking, but is apparently a tongue-in-cheek reference to the stupidity of the article.

This is an excellent satire of the ignorance of mis-informed people and was convincing enough to incite a major flamewar, and some responses from genuine idiots (although they may have also been intelligent people carrying tbe joke on)

OK, now that I've effectively killed this thread, I'll think I'll go steal some LP's with my quake hacking program while sucking on a pacifier and getting menangitis from my monitor that is possessed by satan;)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
#1. Changing ISP's-  Perhaps your Son wanted to change ISP's, simply because in many urban and suburban area AOL servers are very busy.  When the servers are busy, getting signed online is nigh on impossible, and when you do, just opening an email can take as long as 10 minutes.
<BR>

<BR>
#2 Software that you did not install.   OK..Comet Cursor, Bonzai Buddy, and Flas are all LICENSED programs by MAJOR software companies that are nothing moroe then user-interface stuff.   I.E. Comet Cursor makes your little pointer, look like other things instead.  Flash simply allows you to watch MPEG or other format videos.  Research before you open your hole about something you are obviously clueless about.
<BR>
#3 New Hardware.  Ok.. You bought a Compaq.  Thats like saying you bought a Yugo.   I am sure your driving your fat yuppie ass around in an Audi or a lexus, Why should your kid hafta use a crappy computer?
<BR>
#4 Hacker Maunals... Dude, you listed some of the most prominent works of Science Fiction in Modern Literature..
<BR>
#5 Time spent using it.  Let me throw an idea out at you.  Perhaps your son is not finding any mental stimulation in your house because your letting him ready anything more mentaslly challenging then Winnie the Pooh?
<BR>
#6 Quake.   Quake is a computer game that is interactive with other players over the internet.  Let me tell you, playing quake and shooting a gun are now wheres NEAR the same, and I am speaking with 12 years of Law Enforcement experience here.
<BR>
#7 Behavior.  ALL kids manifest surly and bad behavior from the ages of 10 till about 18 or so.  Its them trying to gain their indepenance and freedom, trying to find their personal boundaries, and experimenting with their personality...in short, discovering who they are.  Be patient and love your kid, and he will get thru it.  Try and "punish" this behavior, and it will only last longer.
<BR>
#8 Linux... In Laymans Terms, Linux is just another version of Windows.  No different.  there is nothign that can;t be done in Linux that ya can't in Windows.
<BR>
#9 Appearance... See my answer for #7
<BR>
#10 Otaku Hacker Assaociation?  The otaku are from a GAME created by FASA in 1989 called Shadowrun.  They are not now, and have never been a REAL computer hacker group.
<BR>

<BR>
I suggest you get your head out of your ass, and realize that real life is not like an episode of Donna Reed or Leave it to Beaver.  All you are doing is ensuring that your child is as closeminded and hate mongering of anything different then he is.   If you really feel the need to condtinue your child in this mindset, however, I can suggest a few groups that could help you.
<BR>

<BR>
The Nazi Party.  They fostered many of the same ideas of censorship and uber-conservativeness that you are preaching.  So go be a good father, and have your child go cook some Jews or blacks, or whomever is your hated person of the week.

I think the recent events of 9-11 should not be ignored however as parents consider whether to administer "tough love" on their children because of suspected "hacking."
<BR><BR>
Some of my fellows down at the office have mentioned that Osama Bin Laden might have been using Lennox in his terrorist activities.  I think that the implications are obvious: if your young ones are using Lennox, they may unwittingly be supporting Anti-American terrorist activities.  <b>Don't forget that!</b>  You have a duty to our nation as well as to your children to root out your child's discussions of Lennox!
<BR><BR>
I would also like to suggest some questions to ask your child:
<ul>
<li>What is a "RAM"?
<li>How fast in Megs is our Computer?
<li>Have you ever "crashed" our Windows?
</ul>
Knowledgable answers to these questions should lead you to no other conclusion than to pull the plug <b>and administer "tough love"--harshly, and repeatedly if necessary</b>--to your child.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

i suggest if you have any friends left, and if they have kids, you should talk to them about their kids computer habits, im sure you'd be surprised that the other kids arnt hax0ring j00 but they spend the same time on their computer listening to mp3s through x11amp in linux. and one more thing, LOOK AT TUX THE PENGUIN, WOULD IT MISLEAD YOUR SON?

Ok, I think this has been settled, but anyway, please tell me this is a joke?  People have already posted just about every reason why the article is false.  I wish someone would put a big giant "FICTION" on the title... For those of you who beleive it, please, do more research.  And not just the kind on CNN, FOX, etc... Use "the hacker's favorite search engine"... Google! (a joke, to be sure everyone gets it)  That copy of the Hackers Manifesto is very good, and if you didn't, I suggest you read it.
<BR>

<BR>
Most of all, despite popular beleif, not all hackers are evil.  Some just like computers.
<BR>
I hope that you understand why this article is a joke now.  No basis in fact.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First off, I must say that you sir, are severely misinformed.  A hacker is not a criminal.  And hacking is not necessarily related to computers. If you had a brain, you could use it to read something like, oh, I don't know, the dictonary maybe, and reading the effing definition of hacking.  It isn't computer crime, It is the ability and desire to use ones knoweledge of a specific thing, and play with it.  Hackers are intelligent people, not criminals.  
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly, I'm sure this is a big no-no for you, but do it anyways...  Read a book called "The Hacker Ethic."  Before you slam anyone or disgrace a group of people that made the world what is today, research and understand who they are and what they do.
<BR>
I noticed a post regarding someone mentioning they went out and bought Windows XP.  First off, that is a very insecure Operating System designed by people that could very well be hackers, and most likely are.  
<BR>

<BR>
Please, don't spread misinformation like this.  Hackers aren't felons, hackers are seekers of information.  Hackers belief in free information, and openness.  It isn't even remotely satanic, or anti-social.  In fact, hacking doesn't create anti-social people.  It just happens to be that most anti-socialness creates hackers (to an extent, and I would even claim that as fact, just a possibility).
<BR>

<BR>
Now, as I said, I am a hacker.  I am also a Christian, with very strong beliefs and moral values.  And very specific ethics.  I know that I am saved, and I know I have a purpose.  And I know people like you are just too stupid to realize that there are people out there with different views, and that is acceptable.
<BR>

<BR>
There are many other "issues" that i'd love to rant about, but, it'd just take up way to much time. 
<BR>

<BR>
Well, anyways, thanks for laugh, and open up your mind, or face a life without freedom.

And in defense of your (poor) argument about linux, If you haven't noticed, Windows crashes 4/5 times.  (for your information, "crashing" means to sto working, when you get an error message, and the whole computer freezes)

Linux provides a much more stable working environment for ANY user.

<BR>

<BR>
1)Linux is not an "ILLEGAL HACKER OPERATING SYSTEM" ok, i have linux on my other comp, its just an alternative, not illegal or made for hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
2)AMD is sold in many places, I have one, and always have, i never bought an intel processor in my life, the only difference is AMD processors are a little more unstable, but for the most part faster than intel, once again a perfect demonstration that american products (INTEL) suck (BTW i live in the US, i just think they suck)
<BR>

<BR>
3)Faster video cards for more 3d gaming there chico, newer games need newer shit, as for more harddrive space and memory just make ur comp go a little more smoothly
<BR>

<BR>
now, im gonna say, dont say shit unless u know what ur saying

<BR>
A) I only know about 5 people who use AOL, since thier service is so slow,
<BR>

<BR>
B) AMD is an american company, (AMD stands for American Micro Devices,) and processors must be made in special airtight labs, and they can only be machine made, no human can possibly etch something you need a microscope to see :), therefore, it could not be a sweat shop, also, AM processors are quite a bit better than Intels,
<BR>

<BR>
C) No processor, Intel, AMD, CYRIX, etc. has ANY hacker protection whatsoever,
<BR>

<BR>
D) it's linux, not lunix, lol :)
<BR>

<BR>
E) telnet is NOT a hacking tool, it is meant as a legit remote access tool, and is used by companies world wide, in fact, a copy comes with every version of windows from 3.1 up, lol :)
<BR>

<BR>
F) You are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO computer illiterate, talk to someone who knows what they are talking about, and they will tell you that about 97% of this is wrong
<BR>

<BR>
I) The only real legit piece of advice I can see, is to moniter what you child reads,

If this isn't a joke article, I hope this guy reads up on computer hacking a little bit more, because he is crazy.  A little too tight on the kids i do believe.

I can not get over this post.  It is ridiculous, and I hope no one actually takes it seriously, because this poor kid has a father who knows nothing of computers, and WAY too much time on his hands.

<BR>

<BR>
1st it's completely apparent that you obviosly have some affiliation or preference to all the links you've given, ranging from Intel/AMD's sites to the friggin White House web page. You were perhaps giving them to further support you're bogus attempt at helping anyone in THIS country. Not only is you're accusation of AMD being "Hacker Exclusive" obsurd but it's silly to the point of hilarity. Then the fact you say that when you Son asks for a new video card you "should" be concerned. Maybe he wants to play a cool new game(which by you're article would mean SIM-something or another LAME, "family" based game. Since you obviously would be apposed to him having a FPS.) Or maybe he wants to watch a DVD or video. In any case I don't think asking for a new video card would in any way indicate that someone, ANYONE, would be hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
2nd you obviously shelter YOUR kids and are only offering the same for all the ILL-Equipped young parents out there. The awnser isn't Sheltering and not talking to or telling your children what those "bad" products or whatever you want them to stay away from are all about and WHY you think they should NOT take part in them. Because in the end they WILL take part in whatever it is YOU don't happen to like, find out that what you told them is basically BS and that you had no REAL grasp on anything relating to the subject, therby ruining their perception of anything YOU have to say and thinking that what they're doing is justified. 
<BR>

<BR>
3rd if you ARE such a "good" parent then you shouldn't have to worry about or watch your "kids" so closly and so harshly. You should have FAITH in the fact that you have taught your children the RIGHT things to do and that they'll end up making the best choice for them. Cencoring what anyone, LET ALONE A CHILD, should listen to or watch or even take part in is BS. Should 13 year old Billy listen to Dr. Dre's Chronic 2001? No, probably not, would Billy WANT to, in my opinion if you're so close with "Billy" you should know what he likes and dislikes. But do ANY of those things i.e. Records, Computer games, Movies, Computers, have any influence on "Kids" commiting ANY sort of crime? NO. Because in the end they should be able to realise and distinguish Reality from Fantasy, and if they CAN'T do that then that's the parents fault. Otherwise those "kids" were destined for Failure and or Imprisonment anyways, like so many are it seems and cannot be helped. Parents can do only so much, after that people have to realise that kids are PEOPLE too and DO and WILL make decisions for themselves and that's the MOST important part of life. Hopefully they make the right choices and have the knowledge and EXPIRIENCE to do so, if they have been sheltered or basically "Shafted" in life then the result can be UGLY.
<BR>

<BR>
Living like the 50's and 60's didn't work for the 50's-60's and it certainly won't work for 2001 or any other year to come. In THIS day and age people and MOST importanly Kids must have the knowledge of the world around them and all to often in America, because of the Religious backround and overall Pig-Headedness that just never seems to happen. And if people can't give atleast some real knowledge and good judgement then they SHOULDN'T have children!!! And THAT'S A FACT!

WHY DONT YOU GO AND BUST HIS BALLS FOR THIS TOO.. maybe thats why he got into like pirating software at most, cause you dont let the fucking kid live, the computer is his only excape from you watching him like a hawk.. children need some breathing room and need to expeiercence things on their own otherwise they dont grow up healthy.. im not saying let them smoke crack im saying if he comes home drunk its not the end of the world, its part of growing up.. and if i was your son i couldnt wait until i got to college so i can do all the illegal shit i want and no guardians!!!!!!!! dipshit<BR><BR></FONT></td>

IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!!
<BR>

<BR>
I agree with the fact that as parents we are responsbile for our children and in keeping with that responsibility we are obliged to maintain their productive and sensible use of technology.  That said, you are doing a dis-service to your fellow parents by telling them signs to look for that have nearly no bearing whatsoever on a person's ability, desire, or intent to hack or become a hacker.  Before publishing such erronious words you should consult some sort of research material or at the very least keep your mouth shut.  Nothing is more damaging than someone who informs people of nothing, and that my friend is what you have done.

For all you know your son is computer savy and because of that wanted to purchase a low cost processor that would enhance his experience and performance.  Furthermore, Linux (uh, Lunix..yeah) is a far superior operating system than your typical windows OS buddy...and because of your son's apparent interest he has figured this out, which is probably he reasoning behind wanting or speaking of Linux.  Heaven forbid that one of our children may actually explore other avenues that the most popular, geez...if they keep this up when they get to high school they may not vote for the most popular person in school for President, but rather the most qualified...what would the world come to then.  Sorry, getting back to the point, reading and doing are two seperate things...I once read a book about a Korean spy who blew up a plane...um..let's see her, intent to blow up plane...nope, intent to learn and understand what other humans think, do, etc (hence the reason I read your insane article).  That said I must conclude...
<BR>

<BR>
You are out of touch, unrealistic and highly mis-informed...I hope for the sake of your children and wife, shoot for that fact your neighbors (can you imagine living next to this guy)that you may be more like your son in the future and actually pick up a book and read about a topic before claiming to be an expert in it.

<BR>
Good day,
<BR>
I am forwarding this to you because I am a satisfied AMD shareholder and K6 series user. I believe your legal department would like to talk with the author of the following quote.
<BR>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. 
<BR>

Hope they sue your butt for more than you're worth (which isn't a hell of alot by my estimate).
<BR>
Perhaps THAT will give you a lesson on ignorance.

And dont go on other ppls opinions either, that is worse. That is how things get blown out of context and deemed "bad"Linux and unix are alternant operating systems like windows and windows XP etc. Do you think a Macintosh platform is a hacking os?? if ya do your very very computer illiterate and need to learn more about computers before passing judge ment on things you don't know about. I am almost 28 years old and i play Quake on a regular basis. It is a fun game that i enjoy, I havnt gone out and shot anyone, hell i dont even own a gun. I also watch Draganball Z a cartoon, it has simulated violence in it does that make it bad? If you have to be worried what your kid does with computer knowlage then maybe you should not have a computer or maybe not even be a parent. Kid learn from the actions of there parents. what you do will have either a positive or negitive influance on them. Depending on how there raised determains how they will deal with society.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I almost fell out of my chair laughing when u said "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash" were hacking programs, no they are not, "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" are cheap stupid things that make your computer look stupid( which any geek wouldnt have) Flash is a program that allows u to watch flash sites, its like html which is used to write every site but coler looking.

But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world... Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn underachiever.
<BR>

<BR>
They're all alike.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." Damn kid. Probably copied it. 
<BR>

<BR>
They're all alike.
<BR>

<BR>
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'm a smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here... Damn kid. All he does is play games. 
<BR>

<BR>
They're all alike.
<BR>

<BR>
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. 
<BR>

<BR>
They're all alike...
<BR>

<BR>
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... 
<BR>

<BR>
After all, we're all alike.

Listening to little old ladies? Why don't you go jump on some MORE message boards putting that shit hole of a post up and watch how long it takes for the real hackers to get you just for being stupid. You don't know what a hacker is. Flash is a hacking program? Webmasters use that for designing their sites. You think hackers dress differently because they are hackers? I wear the same stuff I have been wearing most of my teenage life. The shit you described (Glow sticks.. etc) are stuff ravers and druggies wear. Do you know what a raver or a druggie is? Probably not. Why dont you write another ingenius post about this. I know where you live asshole.. one more lame ass post from you and your kids wont have a computer to hack from (no offense to the son.. if he IS a hacker.. I say right on!) ..anywayz.. I am done wasting my time on you. You are pathetic as hell.

The Conscience of a Hacker

Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering" ...
<BR>

<BR>
Damn kids. They're all alike. 
<BR>

<BR>
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...
<BR>

<BR>
Okey, I just make an essence:
<BR>

<BR>
If somebody plays Quake, he's a hacker :)
<BR>
If somebody wears baggy trousers, he is a hacker!
<BR>
If somebody uses Flash, Linux (Lunix ;), he is a great hacker.. deepshit!
<BR>

<BR>
Okey.. enough of this foolishness..
<BR>
This whole thing doesn't worth more lines..

Not only does this moron NOT know anything about hacking, He proves it over and over with his in-ability to spell LINUX. As for Comet Cursor, Bonzai Buddy and (Macromedia) Flash, NONE of these are hacker programs, they are genuine programs, of which, I have at one time or another tried. AMD is not as he claims, only available over the internet, you can also find these chips in MANY areas, including BRICK AND MORTAR stores, including the one in my hometown about 10 blocks from me. So, my suggestion to this idiot would be to learn more about his (lack of) information about hackers.

After reading your wonderful and informative article i have found that i am, as much as i regret to admit it, a "computer-hacker". i would like to turn myself in. I am guilty of requesting a broadband service from my parents. I thought it was because I felt that we could save money, while also getting a faster connection, but I was wrong.

While these cards do have limited support for 3D graphics, this support is actually designed to discourage use of 3D hacker tools like Quake, Abnormal Tournament and "Serious Sam", due to low framerates and numerous rendering glitches. The hacker card of choice is made by nVidia, an evil Canadian liberalist company whose graphics cards are called the "G-Force". These cards come with a specially designed "GPU", or "Guessing Password Unit", which is specially designed for hacking into computers and stealing people's passwords and credit card numbers.
<BR>

<BR>
You are a moron!!! GPU is not Guessing Password Unit it's Graphics Procccesssing Unit just as CPU is Central Processing Unit. What you think CPU is Cracking Passwords Unit???

<BR>

<BR>
Also, just because somebody wants an AMD processor, doesn't mean they're a hacker. AMD's processors have recently outperformed those of Intel. Seeing as to how intel has a higher core speed, computer illiterate folk such as you, would think that its faster. You're wrong. See, AMD focuses on "IPCs" which are instructions per cycle. Meaning, at a slower speed, they get more things done every time a command is sent than a pentium does at a high speed.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, AOL is the most insecure and hacked ISP on the planet. They're not trustworthy and their "anti-hacker" policy is something comparable to the jaywalking laws that everybody disobeys. A true hacker of course wouldn't want this ISP, but it wouldn't matter to them anyway because they could just screw others who have it over.
<BR>

<BR>
"Lunix"... No, it's linux. These are not illegal OSs... It's not "operation system", it's "operating system", you knave.

To finish, I think this is all some big joke... It has to be... Either that or you're some type of super-moron. Thx.

AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites.

<BR>
thats odd, I bought mine at compUSA and it lets me hack my mouse with the usb protocol (alpha 9).
<BR>
amd chips are soo ghetto, in fact not even new machines are coming out with them already installed.. Did you ever wonder how many childern it took to make up one amd chip? (15)
<BR>
i am wondering why this guy felt the need to make a link(url) to every other word in that pos story.

<BR>
btw, I just hacked my monitor with that amd chip. it gave the alpha protocol #4 to my keyboard..<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Id software has a reputation of being hated, most recently by Dr. Bob Arnot, the most hated guy in gaming cuz he clames this game CAUSED Columbine. Bullsh*t, so many things might have, but those 2 posessed kids liked worshipping Hitler than they played Quake Team Fortress. That's something. Claiming Quake is an enviroment for hacking is NOTHING. More hackers use ActiveWorlds or Haptek to talk hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
Number 2wo: Comet Cursor, Bonzi Buddy, and Flash ARENT even hacking tools! Ive used em, decompiled em, and they cant do sh*t about hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
And, hacking is more boring than playing Quake.

You can't pinpoint how hackers dress and look. And also i need to say you are a sexist pig. Women dont have the skill and can't do anything men can eh? I am a woman and i can do anything you (even though you're not exacly much of a man) can do. Women can hack, they can do this on their own free will and not just "Following in their significant other/mentor's footsteps" I must say, you are THE dumbest man who EVER walked on this Earth.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You can call people that are working with computers every day hackers.<br>
<br>
A Nuker is the evil side of an hacker. They get in a system and destroy everything that they can by using a virus or deleting everything.<br>
<br>
A Script Kiddy is a 'wanna be hacker/nuker' that uses programs written by real hackers/nukers. Script kiddys are 13 year old punks who think they are cool by using other peoples software (Sub7 is a populair one). Kiddys are cought quick, they don't know what they are doing and they stay too long in the system, the IP is tracked down, they do an Whois, find out who your provider is, ask who was on the internet at that time with the tracked down IP, and the script kiddy is cought.
They just don't know when to stop.
If you're kid really is a 'hacker'<b>(and he is not)</b> he could be a script kiddy, and Flash, Comet Cursor and Bozni Buddy ARE NOT hacking programs. These progs are explained in the earlier posts.<br>

First, it is spelt Linux, not Lunix, and it was created as a freely distributable OS based on a Unix system. You son raves about it because it is better than any other OS (particularly Windows).

Secondly AMD processors run rings around the Intel processors which are from my experience substandard. Your ravings about them made in sweet shops is complete shit. The technology involved in manufacturing the AMD processors are incredible. I've been an electronics engineer for ten years, designing microprocessor based systems.

You say that if you spend more than 30mins a day on a computer then you struggle at maths and chemistry? well how come i spend about 2-3 hours a day on a pc and have passed with A's in both maths and Chemistry, with 5 A's and 4B's at GCSE level, and am doing A-levels in maths and chemistry.

<BR>
I couldn't stop laughing at your point on fashion tips for hackers, very amusing. Do you seriously believe hackers stop being human the second they touch a PC? Admitedly they're doing something wrong and they have a few screws missing but your generalisation of the computing world is perposterous, and most people who use the net are, like the vast majority of humans, kind and considerate people.
<BR>

<BR>
You have obviously done a 'lot' of research into the life of a hacker and, me NOT being one of them, am offended at your accusations and general ignorance of these people. They need help, nothing more, nothing less.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. "

I am not a hacker, I'm not afraid of hackers and I know for a fact that hackers are not bad people

You actually made me laugh.. I mean nearly every single one of your "descriotions" of a hacker were just things to promote certain companies and then demote others.
<BR>
Kinda like when you make all those nasty comments about AMD, and then promoted Intel..
<BR>

<BR>
Or when you were talking shit about non-aol isp's and promoting the shittiest controlled isp (AOL)

If I lived with an oppressive, moronic bastard like youself I would DEFINITELY become a felon!
<BR>
     Two things: 1) any and all of your "evidence" does not make your son a hacker in any way... maybe he denies it for hours on end because he didn't do anything... oh, he's rebelling and being mean to you?..well no shit! I bet he fucking hates you by now.
<BR>
            2) Is like like year 1910 in freaking Amish country or something?... you don't allow your 17-year-old daughter to wear make-up or perfume???  That is so fucked up!  She's not a child anymore, man.  One year and she's legally an adult... just watch how long she stays at home; I bet she's already reserved a U-Hual for her birthday!  I can't believe anyone could be this oppressive.  Is he was 12 it should bother you, but what you're claiming is just rediculous.  By the way, she wouldn't have to sneak out to go on dates if you would have allowed her to date in the first place!  Wouldn't you have rather known about it?  Now all you've got is a daughter who's completely ignorant when it comes to boys and dating, and she's going to get horribly used because she didn't learn at 15 with boys that were just learning also... instead you've thrown her into the lion's den with no preperation.
<BR>
     I hope you're ready to have Thankgiving and Christmas alone with your wife (assuming she doesn't leave you) for the rest of your life.  Your kids are going to be the most rebellious, troublesome teenagers you could possibly imagine...and when they move out, they're gone for good!  
<BR>

<BR>
     I mean, screw you!--you senseless waste of human life.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You've made more mistakes on that post than I blink in a day.
<BR>
For one, AMD is not only availabel on-line and can be bought anywhere in any store. Amd is just *AS* evil as intel and have the same security features nowadays. It's not like it was 5 years ago. So dont get on your patriotic high horse thinking intel is better just because we americans say it is. 
<BR>
Amd is a good alternative for people who cant afford or refuse to pay for expensive chips like intel.
<BR>
Second, Comet Cursor is not a hacking tool, never was.
<BR>
Third. Quake is JUST A GAME!!!! 
<BR>
Quake is as much of a hangout for hackers as yahoo chat is.
<BR>
I could go on to disproove all of your little theories but it would take me more time than I'm willing to give you.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes it's very possible be that your son  is/was  a hacker.
<BR>
But, if your son was a hacker he wasn't really a hacker at all, he was a cracker.
<BR>
If you would have done any Real research at all, that would have been the first thing you learned.
<BR>
But just from how you've describerd yourself, you sound like an over bearing nazi that thinks they're being a good parent when in fact you're just being smothering.

This is almst definately what is known as a "troll".  The term comes from fishing, where one "trolls" their bait across the surface to attract fish.  The mythical monster is a happy coincidence.

It says on the Post Comment area that troll messages will be deleted, but what about the articles themselves?

Either my reading comprehension is slipping, or Mr. Gibbons here forgot to include Dungeons and Dragons as a warning sign and/or cause of such behavior.  Other than that, a most excellently crafted piece of humor.  The poll there simply adds that extra bit of flavor to make it seem that much more sincere.

Just because you sit on the computer all day don't mean you're a hacker. Maybe you're like me, a gamer. I stare at a blank screen all day because I play games online. I ask my mother for hardware upgrades BECAUSE THE MORE GAMES I HAVE THE BETTER THE HARDWARE I NEED! As for the author of this little...piece of Internet trash, this message goes out to you. "Try something else. Don't try and deprive the young peope of the world of what we call the Internet. The Internet is the key to knowledge. Try becoming a programmer, or web designer. Becoming a web designer means you have to stare at a screen... all day until you make the deadline. Programmers have to stare at a screen until they get one function right or until they finish the program completely so they don't mess up. Try researching into the stuff before you post dumb shit." thank you for reading. Peace, Love and Jello.

It's not about hacking. Its scare tactics to get parents to invest in certain products, and not in others.

<BR>
@home is faster than AOL, no argument.
<BR>
but, @home is a hackers' domain. Therefor, AOL is better.

<BR>
next-gen AMD processors are superior to the little boasted P4. So, as a result, they are evil. Your processor does not affect your ability to hack. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Linux is 10^1000000000 times more stable than the much vaunted little proven windows. But linux is a tool of a hacker, so therefor, windows is better.
<BR>

<BR>
The products that are not hacker tools are all american made products. Coincidence? no. This was a cleverly disguised pro-american product rally.

I hate AOL, and I really liked your statements about how 'good' AOL is.  And the statements about AMD was hysterical too.  I am by no means an AMD fan, and your slander about them gave me a belly laugh that I haven't had in years.

Far too long has this gone been overlooked, that the dangerous hacker we hear about on TV are IN OUR HOMES.  We as society, see the clues that they leave us but no one has caught on.  They suddenly question authority, they start to have trouble in school, they start to hang around friends you've never seen before, they develope hair where there was none before, they listen to loud music and they start wearing colourful clothes.
<BR>

<BR>
This, my friends, can only be pointed to one obvious and overlooked thing: HACKING!  Who killed Jesus? a hacker. What was Adolf Hitler's occupation? a hacker. Who did Osama bin Laden have sex with the DAY before Sept. 11? a hacker. Is this all a mere coincidence? I think not!
<BR>

<BR>
Another point you have greatly missed is the life style of a hacker.  All hackers look at filthy pornography, so if you catch dirty files on your computer or filthy magazines under the mattress, it is safe to say that your child is a porno-lovin' hacker.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
i think you should educate yourself again buddy.,. except this time.. get the facts.. not the fiction.. 
<BR>
oh and if your son wanted rid of aol.. it is because htey are the most annoying internet provider around.. 
<BR>
17 year old girls sneaking out with lipstick and perfume? get yer head out of yer ass buddy... yes i was not permitted to date until 16.. but the make up situation was allowed once highschool hit.. so long as it was nice and not looking like hoochie mama.. 
<BR>

<BR>
 a more realistic system of keepig control on your kides online is to
<BR>

<BR>
 a.. only let them stay on for an hour at a time,,. but maybe go one a few times a day.. two.. be in teh same room as them.. supervision is the key pal.. not complete censorship.. 
<BR>
i think you are the most ignorant parent i have ever run accross online.. and you can't possibly have a good relationship with your kids bein such a dictator..
<BR>
a kid can be really into the computer.. without being a hacker

Most hackers are employed by various companies, so they can strengthen security of the companies' computer systems.

It's also just an OS, sure you can hack through it but i'm sure there is somebody who has found a way to get through AOL also somwhere down the line.  Next time do some reaserching before you put it on the internet, second of all, this shouldn't even be on the internet in the first place!  Just the number of replies says that alone.  I am 16, my parents let me use the internet freely, and i turned out just fine.  Also why do you have a link for spanking, you pervert?  Only dumb child abusers spank their kids anymore, wake up and welcome to the year 2001.  The last section you made bothers me the most.  My last semester of school i just failed every single corse on the list, but i don't hack.  I just suck at school, it's that simple.

Instead of an arrow they may have an American flag or a butterfly.  Realy scary huh?  Oh my god not a butterfly he must be an eVil hAxOr from heck.  "flash" is a program that lets the user animate cartoons that they make on there computer. It is primarily used for animated websites.  And bonzi buddy i havn't used so i won't comment to much about, other to say that i know many "non-hackers" that use it.  Lunix/Linux is not an illegal OS (operating system) it is simply a freeware OS that was made to compete against Micro$ofts windows and try to weaken there monopoly.  Remeber that America is based on competition. Oh, and its not based on xenix but Unix, which is a code that companies use to link large networks with.  Quake is not an online training ground for hackers.  Its only a fun online game.  However it is violent, but most children know that blowing somone up in a game is differnt then doing the same in RL (real life) But the thing that i find disturbing about this article is how narrow minded it is.  Hackers are not what the media claims we are.  Hackers simply have a hunger to learn all they can about technology.  the hacker comunity dosn't even call "hackers" as the media calles hackers hackers.  We call them crackers.  Remeber always that hackers build and crackers destroy.  The diffence between hackers and crackers is the same as the difference between an attomotive engineer and a car theif.  Hackers don't grow up to be computer criminals they grow up to become programers, system adminstrators and maybe, if they are realy good at what they do, join the FBI as part of there electronic counter measures group that hackers the enemys of the USA such as Osama's networks.  O nd btw computers do not cause insanity due to radiation.  They give off less radiation then a cell phone and are typically much farther away from the head as a cell phone.  And a dinal of service attack is abriviated DoS not DOS DOS is a primiative operating sytem that windows is based on.  And a hacker would never use a DoS attack.  That is somthing only a cracker would do.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I spend hours and maybe even a whole day on the computer. Am i a hacker? no. 
<BR>
i write articles,poems,stories, check emails,read articles written by stupid ignorant people like you and then spend my time replying to them.
<BR>

<BR>
people that dress in bright clothes, wear glow sticks, dye there hair......hackers? thats a matter of opinion.i happen to dress in bright clothes and my hair is dyed bright blue.(i like bright colors, what can i say?) if you saw someone dressed in all black and a trench coat you would probably say that they were the next criminal and they were out to destroy the human race.if you try to catch hackers by the way they dress....your in for a big disapointment.
<BR>

<BR>
so what your trying to say is that girls cant hack? another mistake. however, due to your stupidity and lack of technical knowledge i will overlook you ignorance.im just sorry for your children and anyone else who took this article seriously.

Yes I am a hacker. Not a Cracker which is what most of you think that a hacker is.
<BR>

<BR>
Hacker are people who are emphusiastic about computing now nesserally doing anything illigal.
<BR>

<BR>
Programmers are not melicous hackers Bill Gates is a programmer, would you call him an evil Hacker?
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is not a rip off of Intel infact they are the only reason that intel have half decent prices on thier processors.
<BR>

<BR>
Commit Curser is not a hacking program it is a spy ware program that has a ligitamate perpose.
<BR>

<BR>
Lunix (actually called linux) is the competetor of windows and is a user friendly version of unix which is generally use in servers just like the one that is probibly used to host this server.
<BR>

<BR>
Females hackers (though few and far between) do exist and youo have been VERY sexist by implying that they are not intelligant enough.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is a game. Simple enough.
<BR>

<BR>
The style of Dress you comment on the actually mosher style dressing they have nothing to do with computers, it is a style in music.
<BR>

<BR>
the computer radiation you talk about doesn't exist. meningitus is a bacterial infection not from the flicking of the monitor. if you are so bothered then buy you kid a plasma screen as they have no flicker
<BR>

<BR>
Please reply to my e-mail address at Crash-Manager@talk21.com as I don't belive that you know unough about computers to say they are bad.
<BR>

<BR>
To any one else that wants to reply to my post saying that I'm don't know what is good for me than please do but just send a copy to my mail cause I dought that I will be visiting here for some time as I have to go off and do illigal things with comet cursor (tux only knows what)
<BR>

<BR>
For all you hackers, crackers, script kiddies, sysadmin what ever you want to call your selves, the people on this site and similar really need educating. they know very little about cyberspace.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope you all take this to mind and use this infomation for good use.

<BR>
First of all, I can see that you are an american. How??? Because you actually believe all the pro-America anti-Russia propaganda. ALL OF IT!!! Before you can actually teach your children you should start having opinions of your own, not the opinions you see in slogans and american propaganda.
<BR>

<BR>
And do you REALLY spy on your children. You actually lurk and see what they read. I have read a lot of books concerning World War 2. Does that make me a fascist, a communist or somehow a militious person? I mean, you can't categorize people because they read something. You should be happy that your son is actually reading. That my friend, is called learning. You should try to become a little bit more open minded and let other people influence you too, instead of just you trying to influence the others!
<BR>

<BR>
I also noticed a number of religious slogans there in your post. It seems that you, mr Gibbons, are a fanatic! I personally think that ALL KIND of fanaticism is BAD. Don't be so absolute. You can't see the big picture like that. It's not such a horrible dark world out there. Or outside America as you probably think of it. America and the rest of the world.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Firstly most of the behavioral traits ascribed as signs of your son's alleged hacking are caused by bad or misguided parenting, look closer to home for the root of the problem before pointing fingers.
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly you obviously have an extremely limited knowledge of computing and should at take the time to acquire at least a basic understanding of Computers before you start accusing anyone of hacking (Which You clearly have no understanding whatsoever)or offering advise on subject outside your understanding.
<BR>

<BR>
It is truly a shame when people either out of Ignorance or misguided good intentions make unfounded accusations against both people & or products (which are both done in the responded to posting)
