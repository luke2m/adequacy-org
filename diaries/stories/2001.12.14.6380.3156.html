<p>
What Does God Have To Say?
<p>
I am writing this urgent message because I was once a witch. I lived by the stars as an astrologer and numerologist casting horoscopes and spells. I lived in the mysterious and shadowy realm of the occult. By means of spells and magic, I was able to invoke the powers of the
"controlling unknown" and fly upon the night winds transcending the astral plane.
<p>
Halloween was my favorite time of the year and I was intrigued and absorbed in the realm of Wiccan witchcraft. All of this was happening in the decade of the 1960's when witchcraft was just starting to come out of the broom closet.
<p>
It was during that decade of the 1960's, in the year 1966, that a woman named J.K. Rowling was born. This is the woman who has captivated
the world in the year of 2000 with four books known as the "Harry Potter Series." These books are orientational and instructional manuals of witchcraft woven into the format of entertainment. These four books by J.K. Rowling teach witchcraft! I know this because I was once very much a part of that world.
<p>
Witchcraft was very different in the 1960's. There were a lot fewer witches, and the craft was far more secretive. At the end of that spiritually troubled decade, I was miraculously saved by the power of Jesus Christ and His saving blood. I was also delivered from every evil
spirit that lived in me and was set free. 
<p>
However, as I began to attend fundamental Christian churches, I realized that even there
witchcraft had left its mark. Pagan holidays and sabats were celebrated as "Christian holidays."
<p>
As time went on, I watched the so-called "Christian" churches compromising and unifying. I also watched with amazement as teachings from Eastern religions and "New Age" doctrine began to captivate congregations. It was a satanic set-up, and I saw it coming. Illuministic conspirators were bringing forth a one-world religion with a cleverly concealed element of occultism interwoven in its teachings.
<p>
In order to succeed in bringingwitchcraft to the world and thus complete satanic control, an entire generation would have to be induced and taught to think like witches, talk like witches, dress like witches, and act like witches. The
occult songs of the 1960's launched the Luciferian project of capturing the minds of an entire generation. In the song "Sound Of Silence" by Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel, we were told of seeds that were left while an entire generation was sleeping, and that the "vision that was planted in my brain still remains." Now it is the year 2001. All of the foundations for occultism and witchcraft are in place. The Illuminists
have to move quickly, because time is running out.
<p>
It was the Communist revolutionary Lenin who said, "Give me one generation of youth, and I will transform the entire world." Now an entire
generation of youth has been given to a woman named J.K. Rowling and her four books on witchcraft, known as the Harry Potter Series. As a
former witch, I can speak with authority when I say that I have examined the works of Rowling and that the Harry Potter books are training
manuals for the occult.
<p>
Untold millions of young people are being taught to think, speak, dress and act like witches by filling their heads with the contents of these books.
<p>
Children are obsessed with the Harry Potter books that they have left television and video games to read these witchcraft manuals. The first book of the series, entitled "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," finds the orphan, Harry Potter, embarking into a new realm when he is taken to "Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry." At this occult school, Harry Potter learns how to obtain and use witchcraft equipment. Harry also learns a new vocabulary,
including words such as "Azkaban," "Circe," "Draco," "Erised," "Hermes," and
"Slytherin"; all of which are names of real devils or demons. These are not characters of fiction!
<p>
How serious is this? By reading these materials, many millions of
young people are learning how to work with demon spirits. They are
getting toknow them by name. Vast numbers of children professing to
be Christians are also filling their hearts and minds, while willingly
ignorant parents look the other way.
<p>
The titles of the books should be warning enough to make us realize
how satanic and anti-christ these books are. The afore mentioned title
of the first book, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," was a
real give away. The second book was called "Harry Potter and the
Chamber of Secrets," while the third book was entitled "Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban." Sadly enough, this blatant
witchcraft has been endorsed by
well-known and respected "Christian" leaders. Nothing could be more obvious than that Harry Potter books are pure witchcraft and of the
devil.
<p>
The "Christian" leaders, however, defend them by saying that good
magic
always wins and overcomes evil magic. This is the oldest con game ever
hatched out of hell. As a real witch, I learned about the two sides of
 "the
 force."
Apparently, so do many "Christian" leaders. When real witches have
sabats and esbats and meet as a coven, they greet each other by saying
 "Blessed be," and when they part, they say "The Force be with you."
Both
sides of this "Force" are Satan. It is not a good side of the force
that overcomes the bad side of the force, but rather it's the
blood of Jesus Christ that destroys both supposed sides of the
satanic "Force." 
<p>
High level witches believe that there are seven satanic princes and
that the
 seventh, which is assigned to Christians, has no name. In coven 
meetings, he
is called "the nameless one." In the Harry Potter books, there is a 
character called "Voldemort." The pronunciation guide says of this being
 "He  who must not be named."
<p>
On July 8, 2000, at midnight, bookstores everywhere were stormed by millions
of children to obtain the latest and fourth book of the series known
as "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." These books were taken into
homes everywhere with a real evil spirit following each copy to curse
those  homes.
July 8th was also the 18th day (three sixes in numerology) from the 
 witches' sabat of midsummer. July 8th was also the 13th day from 
the  signing of the United Religions Charter in San Francisco. Now we
have  learned that the public school system is planning to use the
magic of Harry Potter in the classrooms making the public schools
centers of witchcraft training.
<p>
What does God have to say about such books as the Harry Potter series?
In the Bible in the book of Acts, we read the following in the 19th chapter, verses 18-20: "And many that believed came, and confessed, 
 and showed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts 
brought their books together and burned them before all men: and they 
counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. 
So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed."
<p>
As parents, we will answer to God if we allow our children to read witchcraft books. The Word of God will prevail mightily in your life 
only if such things of Satan are destroyed.

If we have a decadent society it is because of the lack of parenting, which you likely wouldn't disagree with, and the lack of significant socital rituals including but not limited to rituals of adulthood.<BR>
<BR>
Do me a favor, please don't try to limit my children's access to Harry Potter books. I, as a good parent, will read anything they are reading, and likely sharing some of things I enjoy. Just like I will monitor their TV viewing and Internet use.<BR>
<BR>
-I- will make the decisions for my children and anyone who attempts to limit my right to do so will have a copy of the Constitution waved under his nose.<BR>
<BR>
BTW... I read an interesting "fantasy" novel the other day. It was titled Bible and seems to be a collection of writing from various authors. I would be very careful about it though because it teachs the precepts of a religious cult, two of them in fact.<BR>"Anyone who says something is as easy as taking candy from a baby, has never tried to take candy from a baby."<BR></FONT></td>

What human being worth their salt would think their own values are worse than others'? Such a dysfunctional human would be an embarrassment to the human race.

<br><br>

I'm not sure why you would want to bring a specific religion into a discussion of works of fiction. As I'm sure you know, the Holy Bible is the basis for many religions, not just Christianity.

Indeed. However, Xyon did not appear to be claiming that, merely that he would monitor his children's Bible reading. I'm sure any concerned parent or guardian would do the same. There are <a href="http://elroy.net/ehr/vchip.html">many things</a> in the Bible that are unsuitable for children. Religious belief is no excuse for reckless parenting.

<br><br><i>As for religions 'other than Christianity' being based on the Bible, why don't you name a couple? Hint: Judaism certainly doesn't count.</i><br><br>

Well, two off the top of my head would be Islam, which accepts the OT and many parts from the NT, and the Church of Latter-Day Saints, which accepts the Bible but mainly revolves around teachings from the Book of Mormon.<BR><i>adequacy.org -- because it isn't</i><BR></FONT></td>

The Bible doesn't have values - it's an inanimate book. A book that offers religious and spiritual guidance. Contrary to certain right-wing factions of Christianity, it's not a "rule book". There are many minor parts of the Bible that can be ignored or rejected without going against the principles of Christianity.

<br><br>

For example, I wear a heathen's polyester-cotton shirt, which is <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?passage=Lev+19%3A19&version=NIV">strictly prohibited</a>.

<br><br>

<i>Islam in no way "accepts the Bible,"</i><br><br>

Of course it accepts the Bible. It doesn't accept the holy trinity, but it's quite happy to agree that Jesus (pbuh) existed, and that Yahweh = Allah = God. Try this simple test - give a Bible to both a Muslim and an Atheist. Ask both of them if they think it's a load of old cobblers. The Muslim won't let you down.

<br><br>
Now, if Islam completely agreed with <i>everything</i> in the Bible, it would be Christianity. But no-one agrees with everything in the Bible, because they'd be agreeing with many contradictory statements along the way. Most people prefer to pick and choose their favourite mutually-exclusive option.

<br><br><i> As for the Mormons, I would argue they are still within the ambit of Christianity. Of course, they are sorely heretical.</i><br><br>

So, you'd like to argue that they <i>are</i> Christians, yet many of their beliefs <i>are not</i> Christian. That's a very confused line of argument Here's my take on it: they're not Christians. They like Christianity a lot, but they mostly prefer what's written in the Book of Mormon.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">   Anyone who can imagine that Harry Potter is an instruction manual for witchcraft must be on some sort of drug or very badly informed. We, my friend and I, are both Wiccans and know enough about our religion to know it is far from anything even remotely resembling Harry Potter. For someone who use to be a witch, you sure do know very little about the religion to suggest something that rediculous.<BR>
   You write as though Wicca itself isn't a seperate religion from Satanism and Demonolotry. We do live in a free democratic society and can chose whatever religion we would like to practice. Therefore, if Christians can write children's books, then so can pagans (though I really wouldn't consider this true to paganism).<BR>
   Also, I would be totally shocked and dismayed if I found out that J.K.Rowling actually looked all of that stuff up. She wrote the first book while homeless living in her car.<BR>
   And if you are suggesting that the bible is something factual then you are very ignorant. The bible has been mistranslated, and edited to fit the Church's purpose since before the middle ages. Alas, if Christianity isn't based on the bible, then alot of Christians, such as yourself, who are selfrightous and base their judgements of other religions based on this fictional book have alot of waking-up to do.<BR>
   There is one thing that I do agree with you on. This society and it's major religion (Christianity) are full of paganism and it's symbolism. However, we were first so it is your religion that has desecrated ours.<BR>
   Furthermore, how are you suppose to base a religion on a novel that tells you so little about how to do so. It may mention a few things but it is so vague that if you tried to base something on it, you would never get anywhere. It is like trying to build a brick mansion when all you have is a foot of land and two pieces of plywood.<BR>
    Another thing, erised is only mentioned once in the mirror's inscription; I hope you get your heart's erised because it is merely your heart's desire you are looking at.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
                   Signed,<BR>
                     two former Christians<BR>
P.S. We're glad you've found peace with your religion, now please let us find peace with ours.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
The Harry Potter books cleary introduce concepts of witchcraft and encourage one to pursue it further. They may not be a definitive step by step "instruction manual" or "guide" as you put it - that would be too obvious - but the satanic undertones are loud and clear. Do you think J.K. Rowling used explicit witchcraft terms and names of real life demons by accident? You sure are naive to believe that.
<BR><BR>
I didn't force you to read my diary and I didn't impose my will on you -- just as Jesus Christ does not impose himself on anyone. It is up to each individual to choose or reject Him and the gift of eternal life. It is sad that Satan has tricked you into believing he will give you peace - the only thing he has in store for you is death, hate and suffering. I can only pray that you wake up to his deceit before it's too late.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If J.K. Rowling used <b>Witchcraft terms</b> and <b>names of real &lt;u&gt;Demons&lt;/u&gt;</b> in her books, it does'nt mean she's a witch.. Anyone can do research about cults and witchcraft histroy... How do you think they make history channel programs? RESEARCH!

And finally my friends.. Claiming that the Harry Potter books are manuals to witchcraft is just like claiming that "Jurassic Park" is instructions of how to breed dinosaurs and raise them properly..

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I have studied a fairly wide variety of the pagan paths- Wicca as well as others. I do have to ask where you got a good bit of this.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
"Draco" if I remember rightly, is latin for "Dragon". If it was later assigned as a demon's name, so be it, I could name a demon Richard Nixon if I liked and there's probably quite a few who'd agree with me it'd fit- but that doesn't change the name's original source.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
And Hermes was a Greek God actually, well known for playing pranks and tricks, as well as being a messenger.  Anyone who's had the barest brush with Greek literature in Highschool English knows that. Circe is also Greek in origin.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
As to "Manuals of Witchcraft"- if you truly studied Wicca -which you've dropped numerous common knowledge referances to and no indepth ones- you would know these books are no such thing. The two divine beings beloved by those of Wicca do not even enter a single thought in the book.<BR>
&lt;P&gt;<BR>
And as my parting shot- the most beloved holiday of Christianity- Christmas- uses terms from and is in many ways very similar to the pagan holiday of Yuletide. Maybe you should find a new religion completely if you have objections to religious-crossing, because christianity is as rife with it as the US is with various cultures.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
