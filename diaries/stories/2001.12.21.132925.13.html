      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">This interpretation of the facts is <a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Tower/9730/Count.htm">extremely condescending</a>: the researchers attribute the <a href="http://www.cilicia.com/armo10.html">excess mortality</a> to <a href="http://www.museumsnett.no/nasjonalgalleriet/munch/eng/innhold/ngm00939.html">psychological stress</a> brought about by superstitious beliefs.  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130832545/adequacy-20">Chinese</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1887279369/adequacy-20">Japanese</a> are cast as <a href="http://www.ciolek.com/WWWVL-Zen.html">primitive superstitious brutes</a>, whose <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/sdc/tiananmen.html">irrational belief system</a> condemns to <a href="http://www.abortion.com/">unneeded death</a>.  Comparing this fact to a related non-fact, the failure of AngloUSians to have higher cardiac mortality on the <a href="http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/">13th of the month</a>, the researchers cite the coincidence of the <a href="http://www.fi.edu/fellows/fellow1/apr99/number/num4.html">Chinese word for the number four</a> having a similar sound to the word for <a href="http://www.stileproject.com/">death</a>, which does not hold between the words "death" and "thirteen" in English.  Can you say <b><a href="http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/faq/s-misc/whyterms/">ad hoc</a></b>?

<p>However, the <a href="http://www.xrefer.com/entry/553555">fact</a> remains that the data supports an alternate interpretation, one which would validate the victims of this research: <b>the 4th of the month is indeed an unlucky day for Chinese and Japanese.</b>  Instead of the belief causing the higher incidence of death, as the scientists assume without justification, the higher incidence of death could well justify the belief.

<p>The data gives no grounds for preferring one interpretation over the other.  We have a correlation between a belief widespread in a pair of cultures that some particular dates are unlucky, and mortality data that show that members of those groups do indeed die more from certain conditions on those dates.  Now, the question is to find a cause for this <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~smueller/HappyHour/correlation.html">correlation</a>.

<p>The scientists' answer's starting point, then, is the arrogant, culturalist assumption that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0968573509/adequacy-20">Chinese</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804832846/adequacy-20">Japanese</a> have an <a href="http://www.ams.org/">inferior belief system</a>, and whatever they may think about their increased mortality on these dates does not merit <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">serious discussion</a>.  After all, <a href="http://vector.cshl.org/eugenics/">scientists</a> are the paragons of <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~wlanders/mystclass/mystmain.html">rationality</a>, and whatever they believe is by definition on the right track; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671880764/adequacy-20">Chinese and Japanese</a> subjects, by comparison, are <a href="http://www.aztlan.org/">immigrant communities</a>, working mostly in <a href="http://www.mrchausfastfood.com/">food service jobs</a>, and, by golly, <b><a href="http://www.engrish.com/">they can barely speak English!</a></b>  If they die at a higher rate than people from other cultures in these dates, <a href="http://www.fair.org/extra/best-of-extra/rape-blame.html">it must be their fault</a>.  Thus the "explanation": "superstition" makes these people feel "stress", and the "stress" kills them, a case of the "Baskerville effect".

<p>The researchers, <a href="http://www.voyeurweb.com/">doubtless embarassed</a>, have to admit that <a href="http://www.alanzeleznikar.com/travels/rec_travel_europe_post.html">their own culture</a>, which they tacitly accept to be <a href="http://www.ubermensch.org/">superior</a> as part of the conditions under which our society empowers them to produce such "knowledge", has completely equivalent beliefs (the 13th), but no corresponding increase in deaths.  This, however, instead of leading them to abandon their theory about the minorities, produces the aforementioned ad-hoc <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">pseudoscientific explanation</a> that in some unlawful and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/4727/latin.html">tenuous</a> manner enlists <a href="http://www.lacan.com/lacan1.htm">psychology</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0395925037/adequacy-20">cultural anthropology</a> and <a href="http://language.home.sprynet.com/chomdex/rea44.htm">linguistics</a>.

<p>To any anthropologically sophisticated observer, what's going on here is <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthlikeness/">obvious</a>: the researchers are fumbling to preserve the <a href="http://www.stormfront.org/whitehistory/">ideological preconceptions</a> under which they operate.  It is simply not culturally admissible for their research to reveal that the <a href="http://www.philosophers.co.uk/science/beyond_science.htm">Western postenlightenment scientistic outlook</a> only lets them comprehend the world through an <a href="http://www.quake.com">elaborate social construction of reality</a>, and does not, as ideology demands, reveal the structure of objective reality itself.

<p>There is, however, a deeper reason why these scientists must reject the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004Z58J/adequacy-20">Chinese</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/962593460X/adequacy-20">Japanese</a> interpretation of the facts, that the 4th of the month is an unlucky day for them.  Remember, again, that AngloUSian culture has an equivalent  belief about the 13th of the month.  Yet, no increased mortality is observed for the AngloUSians.



<p>What does this suggest? That <b>while the Chinese and Japanese are correct about their belief about a day being unlucky, the AngloUSians are wrong.</b>  This is, of course, a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">politically dangerous</a> conclusion in a country like the US, with a deeply segregationist culture.  As such, the scientific establishment must resist it.



<p>At least not all hope is lost.  <a href="http://bmj.com/cgi/eletters/323/7327/1443#18211">One response to the research article</a> zeroes in on the labeling of the belief as a "superstition":

<blockquote>

Philosophically, if not practically, one can not rule out the possibility that the accumulating experience of these two large nations gave solid reason to this belief. What if indeed some constituting, traumatic events in the history of these nations took place on the fourth of a given calender and the collective memory later perpetuated and reinforced the effect.

<br> -- Izhar Ben-Shlomo, Visiting Researcher at Stanford University

</blockquote>

This at least it recognizes the possibility of the Chinese and Japanese at some moment in their history having a good reason to believe that the 4th of the month is special.  But it still slightly demeaning: instead of considering the cultures to be fundamentally irrational, it takes them to be in a sense "deeply traumatized," unable to cast away from memory past events which are irrelevant to the future (in the Western conception of it; the idea that the Chinese and Japanese may have different conceptions of temporality evades him), much like some poor chap who almost gets killed in a car accident is irrationally scared of cars for years to come.  But still we see the refusal to take the cultures completely seriously.



<p>I urge you all to respect and appreciate other cultures.  Traditional wisdom, contrary to modern myth, is real, as I have striven to illustrate with just one example among thousands.      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I read with interest your analysis of these Eastern civilisations I also have been doing some studying of these cultures in my part time. Yours was a well written and informative piece. However, I must take issue with your conclusion which I find to be flawed in the most fundamental of ways.<BR>
<BR>
You argue that the Chinese and Japanese cultures are not actually worse than western cultures and that the people of the East are not naturally superstitious without good cause. Sir, I think if you analyse the situation a little closer you will see where you are in error.<BR>
<BR>
The Chinese are, in fact, superstitious, some might even say child-like in their belief in old wives tales (stories invented by grandmothers and older women in the early part of the 19th century which have since fallen into popular use) and magic. The question we must ask ourselves, as indeed you do in your article, is why is it that the Chinese and Japanese hold such preposterous beliefs? I think you, as have I, will come to the conclusion that it is because they are fundamentally less able to turn their minds to scientific thought than Westerners. Consider this, up until the late 18th Century the Chinese still had not discovered the wheel, much like the American Indians they stole this idea from conquering Western barbarians and armies. In fact, consider any scientific invention or great philosophical advance of the past 2 or 3 hundred years and you will see that the Easterners have been left far behind by the galloping scientific developments of the West.<BR>
<BR>
It is clear that the Eastern mind is not one tuned to the idea of rational scientific thought, they are only capable of rudimentary scientific analysis and as such are subject to belief in all manner of hobgoblins, ghosts, and loch ness monsters.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It is clear tha literacy and language are not the positive forces they are portrayed to be in the western world. In fact, it was only the chinese who were stupid enought to read books, and to read the notices telling them where to go to participate in the study(!!! - must always take this into account when doing research about language) that have a problem tying their shoelaces on the fourth. Talk about illiterate, uncontrolled retarded research!<BR>
<BR>
Now back to the original point you made, which was that one shouldn't say that pictures make a language worse. As we've already seen "language" can not get much worse, so your idea of debating the relative merits of weasel vs cat turds misses the whole point of the article.<BR><br><br>

<BR>
That's why I posted it -- show me the fallacy and I'll become a believer.<BR>
<BR>
I'm familiar with how pictographs are formed, and understand that "a picture is worth a thousand words".  I don't believe a pictographic language lends itself to change.  Why has Western language become the de facto language of science?  Is it merely our hegemony or is there an inherent advantage?<BR>
<BR>
Let me "harmonize" with your objections:<BR>
<BR>
1.  Literacy.  Who are the inventors?  The illiterate?  Is a society pulled forward by the masses or the few?  If most of an area can't read, does that make the language they are using bad?  If a significant portion of the population doesn't read a language, does it cease to exist?  I feel sorry for all the folks that weren't really speaking a language, just because they couldn't read.  Communication is the goal.  Easy communication is an advantage.  I believe we are arguing two separate points.  You are arguing the worth of the written Chinese language.  I'm proposing a reason for Western advancement.<BR>
<BR>
2.  You site the instance of a society with a "newer" alphabet and challenge me to contrast it with a society using an older alphabet.  Unfortunately, you miss my point.  I don't care how old the language is. I only care that it is easy to change and update.  Based on my assumption, Korean society wouldn't be significantly better than Japanese, unless there was a significant change in how ideas, inventions and economics are expressed AND one of the alphabets made the expression of the new ideas easier.<BR>

I feel dirty all over responding to it.<BR><BR><i>I proposed a reason for why the advent of recent inventions seems centered in Western society.</i><BR><BR>Even if I ignore the slovenly grammar and the substitution of "reason" for the more correct "argument," this statement is absurd.  It appears the poster is trying to claim that Western technical progress was partially driven by Western linguistic flexibility.  The Western world has only enjoyed a leading position technologically since about the XVth century.  The Chinese discovered all kinds of things first (paper, gunpowder, magnetism, printing, sophisticated metallurgy, and the unified state, to name a few.)  Chinese agriculture and military organization was vastly superior until the industrial and agricultural revolutions in the west.  In short, in order to claim linguistic flexibility to be a credible agent for driving technological progress, you'd have to demonstrate countervailing factors holding the West back and pushing China forward throughout all periods of recorded history, even assuming that "Western languages are more flexible than Chinese," which believe me remains very much in question.<BR><BR>Perhaps you're unaware of the more conventional argument that humanism and its bastard child materialism made the scientific, and thus the attendant technological revolutions possible.  For reference, the humanist movement per se developed in the West just before the Renaissance.<BR><BR><i>I know it's simplistic, ignores many other factors and may even be incorrect.</i><BR><BR>In other words, it's an unresearched bit of high-flown wankery, which is precisely what I've said for three posts now.<BR><BR>I reject your (unresearched, unsupported) assertion that inventors "pull society forward."  Which inventor sat down and devised the three-crop rotation system that nearly doubled farming efficiency in medieval England?  Which inventor crafted the unified state, that (through concentration of resources) allowed France and Spain to smash Italy in the XVth century?  <BR><BR>Your argument was originally that written Chinese was unadaptable[1].  Tied to that assertion is one that Chinese is a failure in the modern world because of its failure to adapt.  This is such a bad idea that it hurts my brain.  Chinese is adapting just fine, actually, just as did English (by losing its identity as Anglo-Saxon) after the Norman invasion.  Korean is also a very adaptable language, and strictly in written terms is frankly much better than our lousy Roman alphabet.<BR><BR>You should do a little bit of research before spewing borderline-racist nonsense with no substantiation other than your dirty little pseudo-educated imagination.<BR><BR>[1] Chinese is by no stretch of the imagination pictographic.  I already said that, but in case you missed it, 90% of Chinese characters are logograms, not pictograms.  About 7% are ideograms, with the remainder (3%) being pictographic.  Here's an exercise for you.  Draw three pictures representing the idea that "at birth, all men are by nature good."[2]<BR><BR>[2] (the opening sentence of the <i>Three Character Classic.</i>)<BR><BR>Nathan<BR>--<br><b>Li'l Sis:</b> Yo, that's a real grey area.

modern japanese does not attempt to represent every new word and concept with kanji. i believe the practice was not even universal pre-war, as many japanese words rely on hiragana (phonic alphabet used for 'native', or simply ancient, versus new, 'foreign' words).<BR>

They would be half right.<BR>
<BR>
On the one hand, being American is all about leaving your corrupt immoral venal European and Asian heritage. When you come here, you can make fun of the queen, the french, the emperor, whatever, and call yourself an American. And God help any idiot that thinks you are really from back there instead of here.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, before you can stop being a drunk illiterate frenchman, or before you can succesfully turn "r" into "l" and be thought of as American, you have to pay your dues. I want to see some respect for the rest of America. I want to see you waving a flag.<BR>
<BR>
So the question we need to ask is: Did these chinese, japanese and so-called researchers pay their dues? Note that there are 3 groups here, not two.<BR>
Well, the slanty eyes are probably OK, and didn't mean to denigrate the fine USian culture by falling all over themselves on the fourth. They can become Americans if they try hard enough. Besides, when they get scared enough of our bombing them with nukes, they will smarten up right quick.<BR>
<BR>
However, the researchers have CLEARLY not paid their dues and must be kicked out immediately (if they were ever Americans in the first place).<BR>
<BR>
The fact that these researchers have murdered scores of Chinese and Japanese in the course of doing their research by stressing them out, has me very upset. I say we take these researchers, cement them into a tower, and fly a plane into it.<BR>
This is the only rational way to deal with the situation.<BR>

The article does not say it is better because of its mysticism.  On the contrary, westen cultures have similar beliefs about the 13th of the month that the Chinese and Japanese have about the 4th.  The difference is that according to the data, the Japanese seem to be right where the westerners have no data to back up their beliefs.<BR>

<BR>
&gt;do you know the author or do you somehow just &gt;assume he is not Japanese or Chinese? <BR>
<BR>
I assume it. Crass I agree, but I bet I'm right.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;The difference is that according to the data, the Japanese seem to be right where the westerners have no data to back up their beliefs.  <BR>
<BR>
The Japanese do indeed seem to be right in their belief that the fourth is an unlucky day - the study supports this!  But the study also showed that this unluckiness manifests itself in a particular way (coronary heart attack).  <BR>
<BR>
Now to say that people of Japanese origin are more likely to die in this way on the fourth, completely independant of the fact that it is an unlucky day, is a very bold claim indeed. <BR>
<BR>
The suggestion that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy is a far more reasonable claim.  And as yet, is not patronising anybody as far as I, in my ignorant, rational western way, can see.<BR>
<BR>
So perhaps the 'offensive' suggestion is that the Japanese are overtly stressed by the unlucky day as a result of the word for four sounding like that for death.  Nope, not offensive yet.  <BR>
<BR>
The researchers present this information as significant, and do not stress mysticism in Japanese culture (or in fact any other cultural differences).<BR>
<BR>
I wonder if westerners would suffer more stress on "death day" than thursday?  <BR>
<BR>
Can we not treat differences like this revealed by scientific research as interesting opportunities to understand more about our own and other cultures, rather than get up on our soap-boxes about percieved patronism?  This is why I believe the author to be condecending - leaping to the defense of the Japanese... could they not do it themselves (OK I continue my assumption of the authors origins)?  And did he not see the names of the researchers?<BR>
<BR>
PS I apologise for the use of "Japanese" as a term for Japanese/Chinese, and acknowledge my own ignorance of both cultures.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
And em is quite right to point out the negative connotations of this.  I argue that the researchers themselves (and their conclusions) were not condescending.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Why is it so difficult for you to understand that some days are unlucky? The data certainly seems to support that conclusion. <BR>
<BR>
The data shows that you are more likely to die IN A PARTICULAR WAY on certain dates, NOT that such dates are unlucky for a variety of reasons. So as I said, the Japanese are correct, such days ARE unlucky.  <BR>
Should we leave it at that, and not bother to ask why?  Perhaps some would like to, instead imbuing Japanese culture with some special understanding of this unlucky day (superstiion? mysticism?).  This is where I felt em suggested Japanese culture was somehow better as a result of mysticism, as I expressed so poorly in my original post.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I lived in China for six years and am married to a Chinese woman. I can confidently say that the fear of the number 4 in Chinese culture is far deeper and more widespread than the fear of the number 13 in the West. Virtually every Chinese person I know, including those with advanced college education and world travel experience, admit to a high degree of discomfort around the number 4. <BR>
    There is also a dazzling variety of beliefs, rooted in Chinese medicine and tradition, that simply have no scientific basis. After the recent birth of my son, my Chinese in-laws had dozens of dos and don'ts for my wife. An example is they insisted that, after a 37-hour labor, she not wash her hair for weeks! Of course she did wash her hair anyway, to great protest from her parents. The fear was that "cold" -- a major element in Chinese medicine -- would enter through her scalp and cause all kinds of physical problems. Apart from the sheer discomfiture of going around with nasty hair, my wife also knew that the grime and oil on her hair probably posed a major germ threat to our newborn.<BR>
    The critic of the researchers who studied the correlation of increased heart attacks on the 4th of the month doesn't seem to actually be familiar with Chinese culture or to have spent any time looking into it.<BR>
    There are also two other mistakes raised in other posts: one person claims that "e-mail" in Chinese has to be rendered as some complicated phrase involving lightning bolts and other nonsense. This is rubbish. The word is easily rendered as "dianxin", literally "electronic letter". His hypothesis that the pictographic nature of Chinese has hampered scientific progress is not new, but my personal experience suggests it is not correct, either. In fact, the character set of Chinese is remarkably versatile in coming up with ways to describe new concepts. Unlike say, Japanese, in which say, baseball is rendered as "basubaru", Chinese almost always finds a way to translate foreign or new ideas into native concepts. Thus telephone is "dianhua", or "electric speech" and baseball is "leiqiu" or "bangqiu" ("stick-ball"). And no, a Chinese doesn't literally think of a telephone as "electric speech" any more than we think of a phonograph as "sound picture". The new word is swallowed whole as a new concept. I was continually amazed at the beauty and elegance with which scientific or Western concepts had been translated into Chinese.<BR>
    The second posted fallacy is the idea that Chinese medicine is far more popular here than in China, where Western treatments rule the day. While it is true that Western medicine is widespread, virtually every Chinese swears by some practice of Chinese medicine. Virtually all. It is so common that herbs, supplements, treatments and apparatus (like accupuncture or accupressure items) are available everywhere and in all major department stores. I don't know where that poster got the idea that the Chinese don't use their own medicinal traditions, but it's utter nonsense.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>
