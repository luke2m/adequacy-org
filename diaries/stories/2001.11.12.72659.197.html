Which may be true; probably much of the evidence derives from covert sources that the US government would not want to jeopardize. For what it's worth, those outside the US government who have been told about the evidence (including NATO leaders and Pakistani president Musharraf) seem to accept that bin Laden was involved.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">True, I read that too.  Musharaff and NATO are convinced.  Yet some NATO members voiced concern over the flimsy nature of the case against bin Laden.  I'm not saying he didn't do it, obviously he's the most likely suspect.  However, it disturbs me that the US media hasn't even questioned the fact since day one.  The media have been judge, jury and wannabe executioner (if you read some of the more right opeds)  <BR>
    Of course due to the nature of the so-called PATRIOT act, it doesn't matter whether you're guilty or innocent, the government can tap your phone, search your house and jail you indefinitely after they've gotten their rubber stamp secret court to "approve" that you're a "terrorist" or could be.  <BR>
    The saddest point of this whole thing is the fact that while everyone has talked about how we can't let the terrorists win and we must go on with our lives they have won by accelerating our deterioration into a police state.<BR>
    Whether it was bin Laden or not, the attack of September 11th has been an impetus for the movement towards the stripping of our civil liberties.  <BR>
    While we're distracted, scared of antrhax in our mail and obsessing over each new report from the ground in Afghanistan, they're also picking our collective pockets.<BR>
    The Republican House has put together a so-called economic stimulus bill that consits of little more than retroactive tax kickbacks to their largest corporate contributors.  That said, we really have to understand what's going on.  They are seeking the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax, a law specifically designed to discourage corporations from looking for tax loopholes and shelters.  IBM alone is slated to recieve $1 billion.  That billion has already been spent, it's taxes that IBM has paid since 1986.  Go over to etrade.com or some other daytrader site and look at the vitals for IBM.  They made over $4 billion in net income last year.  How is that stimulus?  <BR>
    They don't even attach any strings to it.  I could understand if there was a clause saying that these companies a)cannot layoff people or b)must create xxx number of jobs.  They're not going to do that.  This money will go into their corporate coffers to help inflate the diamond parachutes of CEOs who already make millions of dollars every year.<BR>
     Before this whole thing happened, I really was considering leaving the United States in a couple years once I have the financial resources.  Apply whatever labels you wish or put me in a box of your making.  I love this country and celebrate and appreciate those who have died to keep me and mine free, but this is no longer government for the people by the people.  It's for the corporations and their lobbyists. Enough ranting, I can tell I got off topic.<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The Alternative Minimum Tax <b>should</b> be got rid of. It's basically a completely separate tax system from the standard income tax. To be safe, you really have to calculate your taxes <i>twice</i> (once in the standard system, once in AMT), and then pay whichever is greater. This doesn't tend to be a problem if all you have is a single income and no property, but for people with significant investment income, property, or large variations in income from year to year (consultants, people who play the stock market, etc.) it can be a real killer. I've known people who got into serious trouble with the IRS because they didn't know about the AMT, or made mistakes in calculating it because it's too complex and unfamiliar. The tax code should be simple enough that the average citizen, without a CPA, can do his own taxes. The AMT is the biggest single reason that many people can't do that. It should die.
<BR><BR>
If you want corporations not to dodge taxes because of loopholes, why not just close the loopholes by simplifying the tax system, rather than introduce whole new dimensions of complexity?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Fly-by-wire means there is a computer between the controls and the control surfaces, interpreting pilot responce, interpreting airframe responce, and passing feedback back and forth.
<BR><BR>
So, as you stare at your IE 6 on Windows NT that you use to surf the web, think how often it crashes, maybe once or twice a month. Now, imagine putting your life, and the lives of hundreds of passengers in the hands of that computer. Ta-da, that's an Airbus. Software errors have led to crashes at airshows and other places, that might be today's reason, too.
<BR><BR>
It's not surprising, though. It's typical of European behavior to diminish humanity and heroes (the pilots) in a heartless quest for greater efficiency. Thank goodness Boeing-McDouglas still believes in directly connecting pilots to the control surfaces. If a Boeing-McDouglas plane BSODs, the pilots can still dead-stick it in.<BR><BR><BR>

.Net has not been fully implimented.  Passport is not really necessary for .Net<BR>
<BR>
The idea behind Passport is the same as with the Microsoft XBOX and "it's" one UserID and Password for all services.<BR>
<BR>
Also it is NOT a low yearly fee.  You rent or lease the services you use.  You can continue to use them or you can upgrade.  Microsoft with it's new licensing scheme wants to tell businesses when they should upgrade whether they need to or not.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway, thanks for the update on Micro-Soft's excellent new offer.  I had no idea that we wouldn't be locked into year-long contracts, but instead would be enjoying the flexibility of a pay-as-you go system.  You know what that is?  It's called <i>anticipating the needs of the customer</i>, that's what it's called.  It's called <i>creative marketing</i>, OK?  It's what separates de-listed failures like VA Linux from paragons of the American Dream like Micro-Soft.
<BR><BR>
Are security upgrades frequent enough?  Well, all I know is that if users would take advantage of them in a timely fashion, they wouldn't have security problems.  Micro-Soft <i>could</i> just whine and feel sorry for themselves when everyone blames them for user laziness, but instead they have taken up the challenge of users who are irresponsible and made lemons into lemonade.  Lemonade for <i>everyone</i>, including ingrate Lunix users who will enjoy a safer and more secure Internet because of it.

Man are you a fucking idiot.  You think just because some uses a non-Windows operating system that means they are going to launch DoS attack on this pathetic site.  I know now why this site is so controversial.  Could it be that you morons are so misinformed?<BR>
<BR>
I have browsed through you past posts and your misspelling show you are either misinformed or just plain stupid.<BR>
<BR>
Lunix:  It's spelled L-I-N-U-X<BR>

<BR>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Please stop my guts is going to bust.  If I download the newest Service Pack or patch for a MS product immediately, how long will I have to deal with problems while waiting for the next one?  The only reason I enjoyed a safer more secure Internet experience was simply due to the fact that I run Linux.  My PC running running Windows 2000 was almost killed by Nimda and Sircam back when it was running rampant.  I WAITED for Service Pack 2.  <BR>
<BR>
Did relief come from MS?  Oh HELL NO!  It came from Symantec (the guys who make Norton Anti-Virus).  I immediately got on their site(well not immediately because these bad boys have a way of slowing your MS network to a CRAWL) and downloaded the latest update and removal utilities as soon as they became available and solved the problems.  The MS "fix" came too little and way too late. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
I wanna revisit this statement in which you TOTALLY contradict yourself.  It's hard to implement them in a timely fashion if they aren't available yet.  Microsoft's policy is to wait and see how bad it gets and then get around to solving the problem.<BR>
<BR>
Also I do NOT believe everything should be "open source".  Most open source supporters fully believe that OSS can co-exist with proprietary software.  It's just idiots like yourself that think otherwise.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Here you are, casting insults left and right, using the f-word with abandon, and trying to intimidate any who speak against you with threats of violence.  And you blame Micro-Soft for breaking your computer?  Why not blame your fellow hackers who <i>wrote</i> those viruses?  I think if you met them, you would find much in common.
<BR><BR>
In any event, I think you need to take a two-pronged approach to some much-needed self improvement.   On the technical side, you clearly are having way too much difficulty in maintaining your PC.  Have you looked into the MCSE program?  You have tried the "lone wolf" approach, and look where it got you, eh?  Now it is time to settle in and show a little respect for established institutions.  So read those books, and sign up for an MSCE class.  You'll learn what you need to keep that PC working, and do your self-esteem a world of good in the process.
<BR><BR>
The other problem is moral.  You strike out with violence against those who mean you well, and you shift blame for your own failures.  You need moral and ethical guidance.  Have you ever heard of the philosopher Immanuel Kant?  He's the mentor you need.   Go buy yourself a copy of his fine book <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0872202577/qid=1005722826/adequacy-20">A Critique of Pure Reason</a></i> from Amazon.com and study it carfully.

Also it's not a death threat, stupid.  I did not literally post "I'm gonna kill you" or something to that effect.  If you considered it a threat than you also consider yourself a moron.<BR>

<BR>
Outlook Express automatically launches executables<BR>
ActiveX exploit (ie InternetExploder)<BR>
Easy theft of Passport LuserID, password, and wallet<BR>
Administrator account<BR>
<BR>
Many of these have been well documented by third parties, and sent to MS with high priority.  Some are even hard coded into the design of Windows.  Microsoft, rather than address the problem, sends them an e-mail that is little more than a slap on the wrist.<BR>
<BR>
major problem reported to MS (ie Nimda)<BR>
MS waits<BR>
multiple reports<BR>
MS waits<BR>
problem goes public<BR>
MS states they are developing a fix<BR>
Other companies release a fix (ie Symantec)<BR>
MS states fix will be available soon<BR>
Ms receives bad press<BR>
problem dies down<BR>
MS fix released, only fixes half of the problem<BR>
More bad press, including holes not plugged<BR>
<BR>
This all makes me wonder when that IIS fix MS has been talking about is going to be released.  I bet some other company already found a solution.  Oh wait, Sun Microsystems.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Why is it that you and others on this site seemed to believe that MCSEs are the greatest of IT professionals.  I seriously doubt that you have even bothered to read through the course material.<BR>
<BR>
The MCSE covers only glances over networking as a whole.  Also please quit referring to MCSE like it's a profession.  It's a certification nothing more.  The best anyone can hope to get from having an MCSE is a job as an entry-level Network Administrator.  This person would only belimited to Microsoft OSes.<BR>
<BR>
I do not believe that you should run off at the mouth over stating the importance of this certification.  If it is so high an mighty then why is it that there are so many of them unemployed?  They sit there filling out applications out McDonald's while those with higher level certifications keep their jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Any company would be more inclined to hire and pay better someone with his certifications than an MCSE.  Anyone who goes around touting that they have their MCSE is a joke in the IT field.<BR>
<BR>
Also I would like to point out that yes Microsoft (notice the spelling) did drop the hyphen when they moved to Seattle.  Later they set up shop in Redmond.  As for his repeated attacks on your intelligence, I would take his considerations about spelling.  I too have read through your posts.  Your constant spelling of Microsoft as Micro-Soft and Linux as Lunix seems to be a repeated target.  Not to mention your repeated ability to contradict yourself when discussing topics which you obviously know nothing about. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway, you understand the difference between a  cumulitive patch and the parts that make up a cumulitive patch, right?  Obviously, if you are too lazy and incompetent to have gotten any of the previous patches that came out months and even years before Sept, 18 2001  then you need Micro-Soft to ride to the rescue, as usual, and pass out a complete and easy-to-install patch that collected them all together in one place.  So much easier to wait for a virus warning to show up on page A1 of <i>USA Today</i> and piss and whine until Micro-Soft offers a panacaea than to keep current on the numerous patches that came out before.  After, the Web won't surf itself and somebody has to write all that wisdom that we read at <a href="http://www.slashdotsucks.com">Slashdot</a>.  Who has the time?

<BR>
First off after reading through articles written by dmg, elenchos and even articles concerning Linux I can can make the assumption that niether of you (dmg or elenchos) are experts in the IT field.  Having a Masters Degree in Computer Science from the University of California I can point out the utter comical [factual] errors made throughout these articles.  However, it would take too much time, too much space, and I don't wish to rehash old arguments.<BR>
<BR>
Now elenchos, I believe that rather than simply posting "you can find that on a search" whenever someone asks you a question" shows that you obviously lack the knowledge to answer the questions.  Simply because you can READ how to do it, doesn't mean that you actually can do it.  This is why many good schools rely heavily on hands-on training.  Hell, tech support can sit there and explain how to do something, and the stupid-ass on the other end just can't seem to do it.<BR>
<BR>
You also have a tendency to believe that anyone who disagrees with you is a hippy, hacker, teenage boy, or what not and will launch DoS attacks on Adequacy.org.  This as well shows an utter lack of knowledge.  If this person is an American it is his/her right to disagree.  Even if this person is a Linux user I still do not see how you can automatically assume they would waste their time or that they would do "bad things".<BR>
<BR>
Hell I have worked at IBM for almost 10 years as a Software Engineer.  I have been working at the Storage Systems and Server Department at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose for the last year.  Pays great, benefits are excellent.  Hell right now I'm taking 2 of my 4 weeks of vacation to spend Thanksgiving with my family in Kanas City, MO.  Beyond that I would prefer to spend time with my wife and my baby girl.  So I have got better things to do then launch DoS attacks or worse at your web server.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
At no time did he state when he had gotten married.  You are all assuming that he waited 10 years after graduating.<BR>
<BR>
I see nothing wrong with waiting to get married and have kids.  Most failed marriages are a result of marrying too young.  You only assume that his culture is the same as yours and that he should do things YOUR way.  Many cultures around the world do not hold the same beliefs about marriage that you do.  Get off your high horse.<BR>
<BR>
"My foul mouth" does make some interesting points.  Who is to say that the woman he is now maaried to is his first wife?  Maybe any of the other possibilities he/she presents are possible.  Once again I memtion cultures.  In some cultures the husband is much older than the wife.<BR>
<BR>
Who cares what Linus Torvalds did.  He's obviously NOT Linus Torvalds.  LT works at Transmeta.  This guy works at IBM.  How long was it till Bill Gates had kids?<BR>

The thought that this person is a computer scientist is hilarious.  This is someone that can't even understand that can't get the spelling of Linux correct.  He also can't seem to realize that Linux kernel hackers are no different from the Windows kernel hackers.  I never in my life would have met a computer scientist that would call for a Ban on Programming. Yeah I'm pretty sure that he, as soon as he got to whatever rinky-dink school he went to (hell screw it he's probably still in High School) decided "gee I wanna be a computer scientist.  I also seriously doubt that he would pass his "tests" that he believes should be instituted.<BR>

<BR>
Gave up a career as an MCSE?  As someone stated before this is a certification not a career.  What's so great about programming in visual basic?  And why oh why are MCSE and programming together.  I have never met any "MCSE" that knows squat about programming.  I think there's a confusion between Programming in "Visual Basic" and writting simple log in scripts.  I have never met a professional programmer who touts the MCSE.<BR>

I don't know what reply these personal flames deserve.  Are you trying to make a point of some kind?  Everything you read about D.M.G. and myself is true.  If you don't believe it, why not show a fact or two to support your case?  Because it's easier to spew out random insults and pick at spelling?

By the way, tkatchev is not on staff here.  He is simply given the privlige of writng his paranoid ravings in his diary, along with the other users.  I think it is far too much latitude for someone of his background and mental state (he has issues with anger management), but others feel he is harmless.  Since everyone knows he is Russian and grew up under the hopeless Soviet educational system, it is presumed that nothing he says is taken seriously by anyone.  
<BR><BR>
But if you think it is funny, or don't think it's funny (you can't seem to decide), at least you're getting something out of it, and I suppose all the time you spend writing spelling flames is time not spent writing viruses and hacking networks.  We can all be grateful for that.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

Now if by some chance, elenchos, you do have a degree in computer science, the post about viewing HTML did not paint you in a good light.  You and others calling this illegal and hacking show little knowledge in that respect.  HTML is an open standard.  It's not only a standard but it open source as well.<BR>
<BR>
I have seen it all over this from others too.  People claiming that viewing header information is illegal.  It is perfectly legal and even ethical.<BR>
<BR>
Viewing the header information for e-mails is also legal.  If someone is spamming you, wouldn't you like to know where the message originated so you can report them to their ISP?<BR><BR></FONT></td>
