		Islam, the <a href="http://www.sim.org/simnow/religions/islam.html">fastest-growing religion</a> on Earth, has become a "hot topic" due to its connection with the recent terrorist attacks in the United States. Although it is a topic that has been <a href="./2001.6.26.133444.239.html">covered</a> <a href="./2001.6.30.54853.5447.html">in the past</a> by <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a>, I think that it is time that <a href="../index.html">we</a> offer an objective overview of the Muslim religion (our technically-inclined readers may consider this in the same tradition as the <a href="http://www.waferbaby.com/howto/havedungeonsanddragonsthemedsex/">"HOWTO"</a> article or the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2433.html">"RFC"</a>).

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>Ever since the events of <a href="http://www.freedomdomain.com/karma.html">September 11th</a>, much has <a href="http://www.cbn.com/partner/Article_Display_Page/0,,PTID2546%7CCHID101025%7CCIID815500,00.html">been written</a> on Islam. As a personal witness to the tragedy, 
I remember wondering what form of <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/132/35.0.html">twisted religious thinking</a> would advocate the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/angryindian/pagegenocide.html">deaths of thousands of innocents</a>? With some time spent in research, I believe I have come to an answer. I myself, am obviously not a <a href="http://www.pipebombnews.com/index.cfm?page=binladen%2Ehtm">follower of Mohammed</a>, so this article, unlike almost all others on Islam, is not a <a href="http://www.thetruereligion.org/">preachy attempt to convert you</a> to the "way of allah". Rather, the purpose is to offer an <a href="http://www.khouse.org/strategictrends/islam/">explanation of Islam</a> that clearly defines what the religion means to a <a href="http://www.atheist.org/">non-believer</a>.

<h4>Early History of Islam</h4>

<p>The beginnings of Islam can be traced back to 570 AD, when an Arab shephard, named <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> (which means "worthy of praise") was born near Mecca, in what is now <a href="http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/Div/SAUDI.HTM">Saudi Arabia</a>. Mohammed was given to spending a great deal of his time holed up in caves, away from people, where he would pray and meditate to the <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/xteen.html">pagan gods</a> which his <a href="http://www.americanwicca.com/">primitive people</a> worshipped. At the age of forty, according to tradition, Mohammed recieved a message from the angel <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~lantz/pages/genesis.html">Gabriel</a>, which he transcribed into what is now the Holy Koran (the question of whether an itinerant sheepherder could actually be literate is still debated in non-Islamic circles, although it is taken as blind dogma amongst <a href="http://gods-open-door.org/QnA/madcamel.html">believers</a>). After achieving a few token converts, Mohammed and his followers were forced to flee to Ethiopia, where they were kindly recieved by the Christians already living in exile there.

<p>After several years in Africa, Mohammed decided it was time to return to his homeland, so he gathered his followers, and <a href="http://www.flex.com/~jai/satyamevajayate/mohwar3.html">captured the city of Yathrib</a>, which they renamed to Medina. From this central location, the followers of <a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Islam8%20.htm">"the Prophet"</a> launched attacks on merchants headed to Mecca, with the intention of disrupting the economic power of their enemies (the parallels to the more recent activities of modern Muslims are, I think, obvious). Mohammed and his followers, through their tactic of attacking harmless businessmen, eventually weakened the city so greatly that in 630 Mecca fell to the invading Islamic hoardes. After brutally supressing the local Christian and Jewish communities, Mohammed died in 632, survived by his ten wives.

<h4>Muslim Beliefs</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=24851">All Islamicists</a>, no matter which <a href="http://www.noi.org/">splinter sect</a> they belong to, believe in certain "irrefutable" tenets. These are collectively referred to as the "Pillars of Islam". There are seven of these, and I shall cover each individually.

<li><b>1. Shahada</b> - the declaration of faith. This consists of repeating the phrase "There is no god but Allah, and Mohammed is his prophet". Even though this statement is <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/0042/0042_01.asp">demonstrably false</a>, it is nonetheless effective. As the author of a <a href="http://www.schwarzreport.org/yct/09ycttc.htm
">report on similar activities</a> writes, <i>"The process of indoctrination by repetition rather than reason is frequently termed brainwashing"</i>. The end result of the <i>shahada</i> is a self-induced brainwashing, which completes the Muslim's "submittance" (the meaning of the word "Islam") to their god.</li>

<li><b>2. Salat</b> - the ritual prayer five times a day. As in the <i>shahada</i> covered above, repetition is key to the <i>salat</i>. The Mulsim recites a long prayer in Arabic (which is the only language accepted by believers) while kneeling in the direction of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/freethoughtmecca/uzairsonofgod.htm">Mecca</a>. The reason for that particular direction should be clear: it is to remind the Muslim that the middle east is Holy, and must remain under Islamic control. Although both Mecca and Medina themselves are under the rule of the Islamic sultans of Saudi Arabia, conquering <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/10/18/News/News.36446.html">Jerusalem</a>, considered the third most holy city is Islam, remains the dream of the Muslim people.</li>

<li><b>3. Zakat</b> - the tithe. As one who fully <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-r008.html">"submits"</a> to Allah, the Muslim is obliged to give a certain percentage of his income to his mosque. The historical roots of this practice come from the <i>jizya</i>, the tax levied by Mohammed against all <a href="http://www.jpfo.org/">non-Muslims</a> under his rule. Eventually, this was expanded to cover <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/3440/islam.html">Muslims</a> as well, with the money going to fund Islamic wars against non-believers, such as the attack and invasion of Spain. Today, the tradition continues, with <i>zakat</i> monies going to unspecified "charities" in the middle east which are responsible for arming organizations such as <a href="http://www.jtf.org/ramallah.article.htm">the PLO</a> and Osama Bin Laden's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-092401alqaeda.story">Al Qaeda</a>.
</li>
<li><b>4. Fasting for Ramadan</b> - Although a seemingly innocous tradition, the <A href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,415797,00.html">month-long period</a> in which Muslims take no food during the day is a symbol of much more. Unlike the <a href="http://www.adl.org/">Jewish</a> Passover, which is a rememberance of the past, the celebration of Ramadan is a preparation for the future. On the day when all Muslims are commanded to take arms against the infidels, they will be forced to leave their homes to wage <a href="http://answering-islam.org/Nehls/Ask/war.html">holy war</a>. When this occurs, they will be conditioned, by the fasting celebration, to not require food or sleep. Since Islamic countries have been historically low on food supplies, this can only be a benefit. Note that this should not be confused with the healthful, Christian practice of <a href="http://www.fastingprayer.com/">fasting</a>.
</li>
<li><b>5. Hajj</b> - the pilgrimage to <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3ba09a88411b.htm">Mecca</a> is considered to be a neccesary part of every Muslim's life. Indeed, a <a href="http://www.hinduunity.org/">Muslim's piety</a> is measured by how many of these <i>hajj</i> he has made. The idea of the <i>hajj</i> was not "dictated by Allah" to Mohammed until after he conquered the city. After butchering the native merchants, it is clear that the Prophet needed some way to raise enough funds to maintain the city. What better way than to force, through threat of eternal damnation, millions of followers to visit a city you rule? Nowadays, Mecca is under the control of the <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/032800-01.htm">Saudi regime</a>, which continues this deceit. In fact, although the <a href="http://www.amnesty-usa.org/countries/saudi_arabia/">Saudi government</a> justifies its high oil prices on the grounds of its supposed poverty, they take in excess of 12 billion dollars <b>per year</b> on <i>hajj</i> pilgrims alone. If only that money were doing some good for the poor rather than directly funding attacks on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">our nation</a>.
</li>
<li><b>6. Jihad</b> - the holy war. Ever since Mohammed called upon his followers to sack and pillage the cities of Yathrib and Mecca, Muslims have been <a href="http://www.stormfront.org/whitehistory/hwr23.htm">leading wars</a> against the <a href="http://www.marxists.de/war/wtc/terrorism.htm">"infidels"</a>. According to the Koran, Allah demands the blood of those who dare to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374524971/adequacy-20">fight back</a>: 
<blockquote>The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His apostle, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution or crucifixion (Surah 5:33)</blockquote>
Furthermore, the death of a non-Muslim is not considered a crime: <i>No Muslim should be killed for killing a kafir (infidel). (Vol 9:50)</i>, and any Muslim killed in the <i>jihad</i> is guarenteed rewards, either in this life or the next:
<blockquote>
The person who participates in Jihad in Allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except belief in Allah and His apostle, will be recompensed by Allah either with a reward or treasure (if he survives) or will be admitted to paradise (if he is killed). (Vol 1:35) 
</blockquote>
It should be clear that the suicide bombers of Sept. 11th believed that they would be sent to paradise, their station in Heaven improved with each "American dog" they killed.
</li>
<li><b>7. Fatwa</b> - the sacred edict. According to Islamicist laws, those who are higly educated in the Koran can issue edicts which all followers of the faith must obey. Osama bin Laden, <a href="http://usinfo.state.gov/topical/pol/terror/99129502.htm">terrorist Number One</a>, and the <a href="http://www.observer.co.uk/Print/0,3858,4276870,00.html">"conscience of Islam"</a>, is one such cleric, and his <a href="http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm"><i>fatwas</i></a> are widely followed throughout the <a href="http://www.webcom.com/hrin/magazine/july96/muslim.html">Arab world</a>. A <i>fatwa</i> is to be followed by all Muslims, no matter who issues it. Thus a declaration of <i>jihad</i> against the "Great Satan" of the United States by some terrorist is every bit as binding as a statement from a true hero such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394171225/adequacy-20">Malcom X</a>.
</li>
<p>

<h4>Islam Today</h4>
<p>It is hard to ignore Islam today. With <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,34238,00.html">terrorism</a>, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/anthrax011016_world.html">anthrax scares</a>, and <a href="http://www.myafghan.com/news.asp?id=1282854154">war</a>, this fast-growing faith will play a much larger role in the future of America. In spite of all this, let us not forget that there are some Islam sects which espouse peace over violence, which is in some ways similar to America's own ideals. With a better <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0028642333/adequacy-20">understanding of Islam</a>, we can prepare ourselves better for the coming times of crisis.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">In fact, many mainstream Muslims say that the "Muslims" who engage in terrorism are NOT Muslims at all, because they've perverted the teachings of the Koran to suit their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
You have to admit that much of the terrorists' philosophy is based on gross misinterpretation of scripture from the Koran.  For example, one verse in the Koran states that for every infidel a Muslim man kills, he'll receive 77 virgins in Heaven:  the extremists misinterpret this verse to mean that for every infidel a Muslim man kills, he'll receive 77 virgins in the afterlife.  The verses in the Koran that say that Muslims should kill Jews whenever possible are often misinterprted to mean that Muslims should kill Jews whenever possible.  Where the Koran states that Muslims who die in the process of murdering non-Muslims will get a free ticket to Heaven, the extremists misinterpret that to mean that Muslims who die in the process of murdering non-Muslims will get a free ticket to heaven.<BR>
<BR>
So, you see, the extremists are GROSSLY misinterpreting and twisting these scriptures and putting words in the mouth of the Prophet.  They'll never hesitate to pervert the meaning of a verse of the Koran to make it suit their twisted agenda.  For example, they take the verses that state that a woman who shows her face in public should be executed, and they somehow twist it around to mean that a woman who shows her face in public should be executed.<BR>
<BR>
The way they freely re-write the Koran, like in the above examples, can they realy be considered Muslims at all?<BR><br><br>--

I wish I could remember what it was called but there were a group of people that tried to spread a corrupted message of the Koran.  Osama bin Laden is said to practice it.<BR>

The bible can be interpretted the same way.  That's why people like Pat Roberston fluorish.  They claim everything thing they do is sanctioned in the bible.  People stop believing this about Protestantism (Christianity is divided into to main sector Catholicism and Protestantism) a long time ago.

... and at a Roman Catholic mass I hear precisely the same thing, except maybe 'memory' instead of 'remembrance', depending on the priest. Or does the Roman Catholic church preach differently to what it implies in its Mass? Or have I stumbled upon a wack splinter sect of the RCC that doesn't identify itself differently?<BR>

Well duh. The RCC has a Council of Sciences so they would be more aware of the results of a chemical analysis of a communion wafer than your average anti-catholic fundy (who doesn't know any science, particularly evolution of the species).<BR>

...about what Christ said.  This is about what the Catholic church's interpretation of Christ's words.  They are, as you may be aware, quite separate and distinct entities.  Some believe in magical priests who can alter the substance and essence of waffers and wine without being told how this occurs.  Did Chirst turn water into wine?  Most certainly he did.

But didn't Jesus say 'do this in memory of me?' Surely the Catholics _are_ doing the bread-thing in memory of him?<BR>

(IOW, Jesus said 'do this in memory of me', so the Catholics are doing precisely what he said, doing 'this' in memory of [Jesus]. Jesus said bread == my body, now do this in memory of me, so to me, it looks like the catholics are doing the exact same thing, i.e. they are agreeing with Jesus in saying that bread == his body, and they are doing it in memory of Jesus, at mass, as he said).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You are clearly a logical person, and would find yourself starving for want of reason were you to become a Catholic.

Contrast this with the Catholic Eucharist where the bread and wine are claimed to actually <i>become</i> the body and blood of Christ.  It's quite simple, Protestants are doing what Christ said.  Catholics have added this idea of 'transubstantiation' in order to legitimize the priesthood.  Clearly this is falling away from the teachings of Christ toward darkness.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Superior at what?  Carefully wording concessions that science does provide insight into the world that religion cannot?  In the face of more and more research the church is finding that it has to give an increasing amount of ground to keep from becoming a complete laughing stock in the face of reality.  Where you see enlightened scholarship, I see clutching at the last straws of relavance...  When it comes to scientific inquiry I'll rely on the secular world...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The criticism, IMHO, offers a perfect opportunity for practitioners to point out weaknesses in the critiquers' arguments, and maybe even refresh their own thinking and remember why they believe what they do in the first place. <BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is the most unprofessional journalistic article I have ever read in my life - and yet this site has the gall to criticise the BBC.<BR>
<BR>
Here are some facts for the "journalist" who wrote this shoddy rubbish:<BR>
<BR>
1) The Koran was revealed over several decades, not all at once.<BR>
<BR>
2) Mohammed never visited Ethiopia in his life.<BR>
<BR>
3) Medina is in Saudi Arabia, not Ethiopia. <BR>
<BR>
4) Mohammed was persecuted for his beliefs by pagans, not the other way around.<BR>
<BR>
5) Christians and Jews were never persecuted in any way  - the prophet himself forbade it. Muslims respected Jews and Christians, through whom they were introduced to Greek mathematics and geometry.<BR>
<BR>
6) Followers of Islam are called Muslims, not Islamicists.<BR>
<BR>
7) There are five pillars of Islam. Jihad and Fatwa are not pillars of Islam. Even the most cursory research by the "journalist" responsible would have confirmed this.<BR>
<BR>
8) A Fatwa is not a 'sacred edict'. Fawa means legal opinion. Any Muslim in the world is free to issue a fatwa on any subject they wish to, and every other Muslim in the world is free to ignore it if they want to. Fatwa's were used as a medieval version of USENET, to let scholars on varying continents around the Muslim world debate on jurisprudence.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The author of this article is the worst kind of journalist - not only is he/she biased, but lazy too. We have our fair share of journalists who do not like the Muslim world at the BBC, but they at least - at least! - are honest, and report the facts objectively.<BR>
<BR>
This article amounts to incitement of racial hatred. The person responsible is either stupid and lazy, or an odious racist.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No you won't, since you can't. The Koran is full of holes. Islamic scholars can't explain them, so what makes you think that you can?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
so again:<BR>
<BR>
It is quite amusing to me, whenever the popular image of Islam being a peaceful, loving and tolerant religion is shattered by anti-Christian verse in the Muslim holy books.<BR>
<BR>
An example of this is the verses regarding 'disbelievers' who believe that God 'is the third of three' etc. Such arguments incite a muslim to quote some passage of some other muslim holy book which appears to contradict the original passage.<BR>
<BR>
This, however, is an unsatisfactory solution because not only has the phrase given in defense not rebutted at all the apparently bigoted meaning of the first phrase mentioned, it has also opened up an apparently contradictory hole in the Koran.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>This ignores the fact that not only did were the ancient <b>ploytheistic</b> Arabs not advanced enough to have a written language (the Jewish and Christian Arabs, who were decimated by the Muslims, used Hebrew), but that a man as simple and uneducated as Mohammed was unlikely to know how to write. Further more, this proves the Koran's inferiority to both the Old Testament (the 10 Commandments were recieved by Moses in less than a day) and the New Testament (Jesus tought for less than a decade).

<BR><BR><i>Mohammed never visited Ethiopia in his life.</i>

<BR><BR>See my <a href="./2001.9.24.203855.101.html#73">other reply</a>. There is simply no evidence to substantiate this bit of Muslim lore.
<BR><BR><i>Medina is in Saudi Arabia, not Ethiopia.</i>

<BR><BR>Someone else <a href="./2001.9.24.203855.101.html#51">corrected you</a> so I won't.
<BR><BR><i>Mohammed was persecuted for his beliefs by pagans, not the other way around.</i>

<BR><BR>Apparently you're not familiar with your <a href="http://www.iad.org/Islam/poly.html">own religion</a>. Muslims hate polytheists -- it was the major reason for the break up of India and Pakistan, and the World War III-like nuclear situation that exists between them.

<BR><BR><i>Christians and Jews were never persecuted in any way - the prophet himself forbade it. Muslims respected Jews and Christians</i>

<BR><BR>So explain A) the Arab world's War Against Israel and B) the Arab world's War Against America in light of the fact that Muslims supposedly can't hate Jews or Christians.

<BR><BR><i>Followers of Islam are called Muslims, not Islamicists.</i>

<BR><BR>Technically, they're "submitters" becuase they've submitted everything, up to and including they're lives, to their dogma. Terminolgy is not important, facts are.

<BR><BR><i>There are five pillars of Islam. Jihad and Fatwa are not pillars of Islam.</i>

<BR><BR>This is false. The "pillars" of Islam do not exist in any concrete form in the Koran. They are a creation of the modern Muslim scholar, who would like to pass off his religion as one of tolerance be conveniently ignoring half of his sacred book. Real faith rests on the Commandments, which were laid down by God in stone, not on the words on men.

<BR><BR><i>A Fatwa is not a 'sacred edict'. Fawa means legal opinion. Any Muslim in the world is free to issue a fatwa on any subject they wish to, and every other Muslim in the world is free to ignore it if they want to.</i>

<BR><BR>Tell that to Salman Rushdie. Islamicists take the <i>fatwas</i> with grave severity. How else could Osama bin Laden, respected Muslim, have convinced the Arabs to unite in sacrificial slaughter against America?

Just because it's written that Muhammed forbade the slaughter of Jews and Christians doesn't mean it didn't happen.  According to the soviet constitution circa 1935, Stalin was the head of a democratically elected government...<BR>

With all due respect to your research and reasoning, as well as your readers', and even fans', most of your words reflect nothing, I'm afraid, but total ignorance of what Islam could be really. In fact, answers like yours today are what make the question of Islam turn instead tougher as days pass, as more people simply go instead further and further from the truth of this religion, still the fastest-growing one on earth, ironically.<BR>
<BR>
By this, it should be clear, I never mean to introduce or imply a beautiful face of Islam and just hide another. Rather, I merely mean you, and whoever like you, to instead be a bit more objective and scientific, at least, and to further pursue this knowledge and that research you've once started, but obviously, never completed. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, I'd like to only add that Muslims, by now, are already accustomed to read and to hear words of pure hate wherever they go. By now, they no longer consider them. But, because your words today don't yet sound as hateful and blind, disguised as deep and in-depth, I'd manage to find some time for such a comment now, I'd urge you, fellow human, to simply correct at least those clear, and funny, mistakes in your article above, and finally, I'd assure you that you are immensely wrong, too far from Islam and what Islam is, even too far from all traditional weaknesses of Islam as observed and publicized by its critics throughout history.<BR>
<BR>
May you in the end turn any closer to the truth, whatever it is, or even to justice and honesty, and to the morals such words still maintains and inspires; and may at least your readers today, some of whom have already taken their hats off so quickly, be any smarter, any more respectful, responsible and sincere--to their own minds, not to the hundreds of millions of Muslims' all over the globe! <BR>

Besides, it's his homework now. He doesn't need corrections or directions. He rather needs to start all over again. Even his titles, let alone explanations replete with mistakes, are inaccurate and biased, dripping with ignorance and preconception. For example, the Pillars of Islam, even Muslim kids know this introductory fact, are only five, not seven. <BR>
<BR>
Thus, if that was the case with the very first and basic information one should first gain before ever daring to explore these murky waters, how about the deeper historical, cultural and political facts and viewpoints involved then? Or, worse still, how about the already-controversial issues a real researcher in Islam rarely has the luxury of remaining neutral towards?<BR>
<BR>
For example, just for example, how about these "pagan gods" which Muhammad "would mediate and pray to," and which his "primitive people worshipped?" In one word, "Nonsense." <BR>
<BR>
How about the fact that Muhammad had never been to Ethiopia, or anywhere else in Africa, as this genius just released? <BR>
<BR>
How about this "capturing" of the city of Yathrib, which Muhammad actually escaped to once, on foot, rather as a refugee, with only one man in his company, both exhausted and unarmed? <BR>
<BR>
And, how about this "conquering Jerusalem" that remains "the dream of Muslim people," if the whole trouble is actually historical and political between Arab, not Muslims, and Israel? How about it if even the modern Israelis, suspected to be the sons of the Khazar pagan tribe, not of Prophet Jacob, finds it too difficult to historically prove this land is theirs from the beginning?<BR>
<BR>
Etc, etc, etc.<BR>

Have time?<BR>

Have fun!<BR>

I'd do it for sure, however. I just have to. But neither here, excuse me, nor now.<BR>

Because he makes a compelling point. 
<BR><BR>
For those who are lacking in history knowledge, the Khazars were a nation in north-central-asia; they were also the only nation ever to convert whole-sale into Judaism. Considering that the population of Khazaria at the time was probably several times the remaning Judaic population, you could make a strong point that the modern Jews are the really descendants of the Khazars. As such, they wouldn't really be Semitic, and would have no claim to Israel.
<BR><BR>
P.S. Little known historical tidbit: when creating the state of Israel, there was a competing proposition to create it in southern Russia. (A little bit west of where the original Khazars lived.) The proposal didn't go through, probably because Stalin was against it. Just as well, I guess, because the area has been recently been found to be incredibly rich in oil.

<BR><BR>Then who did his people pray to? It was certainly not the Christian God. If it was, then Mohammed was not the founder of Islam, which contradicts Islam dogma (further proving its falsehood). If Mohammed's people worshipped the True God, why was he needed? And why did they persecute His chosen people (the Jews), and why do they continue to? All historical evidence refutes what you say. If they were not polytheistic, then they were perhaps followers of Zoroaster (Zarathushtra), though this is unlikely. Although Zoroaster may have been influenced by God (Yahweh), it is not likely that he preached His word, leaving the ancient Arabs little more than Savages.

<BR><BR><i>How about the fact that Muhammad had never been to Ethiopia, or anywhere else in Africa, as this genius just released?</i>

<BR><BR>This is entirely false. Mohammed and his followers left Arabia due to persecution by polytheists (who Muslims hate to this day), and took refuge in Africa. There, they converted the continent to <a href="http://www.noi.org/">Islam</a>, which it remains faithful to.

<BR><BR><i>How about this "capturing" of the city of Yathrib, which Muhammad actually escaped to once, on foot, rather as a refugee, with only one man in his company, both exhausted and unarmed?</i>

<BR><BR>Pure propaganda. How do you explain the Islamic takeover of Medina? Do you really believe that two old (by that time Mohammed was past his prime) men were able to subvert such an economically important city? Your Islamicist views have ruined your objective reasoning ability. The Muslims ruined Medina's importance as a center of trade so that they could rule the city. They accomplised this by massacring, en masse, the Christian and Jewish merchants among the Arabs. You cannot prove otherwise.

<BR><BR><i>And, how about this "conquering Jerusalem" that remains "the dream of Muslim people," if the whole trouble is actually historical and political between Arab, not Muslims, and Israel?</i>

<BR><BR>Arabs are Muslims. The two are interchangeable ever since the Muslims butchered (see my preceding paragraph) the Christians in Arabia. The Muslims hate the Jews because the Jews are the chosen people, and the Muslims worship a false god, Mohammed.

<BR><BR><i>How about it if even the modern Israelis, suspected to be the sons of the Khazar pagan tribe, not of Prophet Jacob</i>

<BR><BR>Are you not aware that Jacob took the name Israel after wrestling with the Angel because he was the "champion of God" (Yisrael)? It is obvious that the Israelis are God's chosen people, which is why, despite not being Christian, it is the duty of every beliver to support them.

<BR><BR>I do not know how you hold such beliefs, which fall before the briefest of analysis.

But, if you claim you are scientific, please consider only the following.<BR>
<BR>
First, your research is, obviously, historical, and religious. For such a research, whatever you present could be only a "hypothesis," dear, but never a "fact" unless first proven and supported by 4 different measures--for each single hypothesis. Ever heard about that? <BR>
<BR>
Second, "entirely false," or "pure propaganda," unfortunately, isn't a scientific valid expression to defend what a researcher presents. And obviously, one can't prove Einstein wrong, just for example, by only barking, "I do not know how you hold such beliefs."<BR>
<BR>
Your language, in this short reply as well as in the original article, I'm afraid, has no connection with any philosophical approach or scientific method. But since your visions are that limited, fanatic and biased, no wonder should be there when your language sounds so as well.<BR>
<BR>
Third, you must realize, I don't only question what you just put here and, sarcastically, believe true. I even question your authenticity itself. Is this what your grandpa, for example, once told you in bed? Or, perhaps this is what you've concluded yourself after a lot of research and investigation with other VIPs, like you, just among God's chosen people?<BR>
<BR>
*** *** ***<BR>
<BR>
Well, in the end, I only have one example now for you to consider, or rather to reconsider:<BR>
<BR>
I said, "... Yathrib, which Muhammad actually escaped to once, on foot, rather as a refugee, with only one man in his company, both exhausted and unarmed?"<BR>
<BR>
Now, I'd pick up *ANY* major reference to consult. For example, how about Britannica Encyclopedia? Fair enough?<BR>
<BR>
You said, pure propaganda. <BR>
Fine... But would you please send me your authentic references?<BR>
<BR>
Well, don't bother, my friend. I won't probably be able to communicate with you anymore, as it's by now only a waste of time as clear--unless you could prove otherwise, which I frankly doubt. I only had a message, for you in particular, and it's by now received. If your pride now is all you care to defend in public, so go ahead. But first learn that I never mean to hurt you or your mentality, rather to help you, to help purify your mind and heart, exceptionally replete with ignorance and full of hatred and racism. <BR>
<BR>
Ever wonder what Muslims really have today in front of people like you? <BR>
In fact, people like you are what makes everyone else in this world suffer. <BR>
That's probably why you're God's chosen people, really--simply to punish us for our sins momentarily, thank God, and right here in this world, so that we can peacefully enjoy the next.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'll follow your works, however.<BR>

It becomes obvious now. The author is Jewish, probably a supporter of the globally condemned Israeli Government, indicted for its policy of apartheid against Palestinians at the UN Racism Conference.

Sharon is also directly responsible for the new Palestinian intifada, which he provoked into existence, and the architect of the Israeli assassination policy which was carried out against Palestinians over the summer, resulting in the retaliatory assassination of the an Israeli cabinet minister last week.<BR>

Also, among other facts you have wrong, Mohammed himself never travelled to Ethiopia. Some of his followers sought refuge there, but he and other followers went to Medina, which he made home for the rest of his life.<BR>

If someone is too ill to travel, or unable to attend a pilgrimage for one reason or another, they do not have to go. Allah will probably not be cross with them. <BR><BR>
Also, Islam allows for the fact that the Ka'baa itself may be destroyed (for example by an Infidel nation unleashing several tomahawk cruise missiles on it), and so in the event that it is impossible to reach Makkah, the pilgrim is allowed instead to circumambulate the Prophet's mosque instead.<BR><BR>
Now we can argue till we are blue in the face about whether I am correct or not, but what is not in dispute is that there are at least four pillars of Islam, and possibly five, depending on how you interpret the Quraan.<BR><BR>
That is why we have the system of Hadeeth and Sunnah. Otherwise the Quraan might not be relavent to today. <BR><BR>
For example, what does the Quraan have to say about programming a video recorder ? Since the position adopted is highly similar to that of performing Salaat - does this mean we are actually 'worshipping' the video recorder ? Some scholars (especially the more pious ones) believe that the video recorder should always be placed in such a position that we do not need to bow down to it. Other scholars disagree.<BR><BR>
One of the beauties of Islam is that it is adaptable to almost any situation, because it is not tied down to a strict text. There is always room for scholars to interpret things.<BR><BR>
The 'mutah' marriage practiced by the Shia is another great example of Islams accomodation of mankind.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This is worthy of some reply. In fact, it's quite significant that such an off-topic one line in my message got such attention, isn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Well, first, the Arabs, unlike you claim, still with all due respect, actually have nothing to do with this Khazar question--or they'd have invested it much more efficiently, at least these days. Instead, it's an army of researchers, historians and anthropologists, from everywhere in the world, including Israel, working on this most controversial, and obscure, history, which is in fact always the case, I wonder, whenever Jews are involved. <BR>
<BR>
Second, I usually, and humbly, care to be scientific and objective, even in my off-topic innuendoes, and I therefore first said only "suspected," as science and history didn't yet determine any truth in this regard. Yet, it's not at all, excuse me, a mere "ludicrous claim." On the contrary, an increasing number of Jews do trace back their origins and simply announce themselves, with no sense of guilt or shame, they could be originally Khazarians. Ehud Ya'ari, for example, a top Israeli journalist who produced the 1997 documentary Memlekhet ha-Kuzarim, is simply one of them. Please consider his following words as quoted by Michael Ajzenstadt in The Jerusalem Post:<BR>
<BR>
"As a child I heard that our family has some Khazarian blood and for 30 years now I have been trying to find information about this exciting subject.... [I am] a soldier in the last battle of the Khazar kingdom, a battle for the right to be remembered.... And finally I would like to secure funds to continue excavations in several places, which looked quite promising. My sexiest dream is to find the actual tomb of one of the Khazar kings. I believe that if we achieve that it will be as important at least as the discovery of Troy or of the treasures of the Pharaohs in the Pyramids." <BR>
<BR>
[Michael Ajzenstadt, "An Incredible Journey to the Lost Empire of the Khazars," The Jerusalem Post, March 17, 1997, page 5]<BR>
<BR>
In fact, I don't think I'm qualified to further discuss this issue in details. Still, I'd like to have a look with you on some scholarly research at this point.<BR>
<BR>
First, and in reply to, "... it was in 1948 that muslim countries expelled their Jews. These exiles now make up 60% of the population of Israel."<BR>
<BR>
Those were the Jews of the Mediterranean cost, especially of Egypt and Morocco. But those in particular, 60% of the population of Israel, are likely to be Khazarians, according to Richard Haase:<BR>
<BR>
"The Khazar Jewish kingdom was a fascinating episode in Russian Jewish History.... The Jews dispersed into Russia, Armenia, Byzantium, and *the Mediterranean coast*. It is likely that many of the Jews of these regions are descended from Khazar refugees." <BR>
<BR>
[Richard Haase, Jewish Regional Cooking (Secaucus, NJ: Chartwell Books, 1985), page 56]<BR>
<BR>
Thus, you only confirm my "ludicrous claim" by this 60% information. However, your information aside, they are still "suspected" to be Khazarians, as we read clear in Arthur Koestle's The Thirteenth Tribe:<BR>
<BR>
"The numerical ratio of the Khazar to the Semitic and other contributions is impossible to establish. But the cumulative evidence makes one inclined to agree with the consensus of Polish historians that 'in earlier times the main bulk originated from the Khazar country'; and that, accordingly, the Khazar contribution to the genetic make-up of the Jews must be substantial, and in all likelihood dominant."<BR>
<BR>
[Arthur Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe: The Khazar Empire and Its Heritage (London: Hutchinson, 1976 and New York, NY: Random House, 1976), page 180] <BR>
<BR>
In a slight note, Judaism in general sounds to be Khazarian now in some other location:<BR>
<BR>
"There is little reason to doubt that Jews had lived in Poland from the earliest times, and that Judaism, *as preserved by the descendants of the ancient Chazar kingdom in the southeast*, had actually antedated Christianity." <BR>
<BR>
[Norman Davies, in God's Playground: A History of Poland, (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 1982), volume 1, page 79]<BR>
<BR>
Finally, Benjamin Blech once found no problem to simply ask:<BR>
<BR>
"... What happened to all the Khazar Jews, both the descendants of the converts and the settlers, is shrouded in mystery. They were certainly dispersed in many of the neighboring lands. ... Who knows? If your ancestors came from these lands, you may have the blood of kings in you - not David and Solomon, but kings who voluntarily chose to join the fate of a people whose religion they acknowledged as true." <BR>
<BR>
[Benjamin Blech, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Jewish History and Culture (Alpha Books, 1999), pages 161-162]<BR>
<BR>
Thus, the attitude isn't hostile, nor is the mind haunted by every consiperacy illusion when it comes to the real scholars and sane sages. Only paranoid fanatics and disordered racists, by now almost everywhere, are who first plant such evil in this world and in advance assume it in every stranger. Still, regretfully, no matter how much we write and explain, they're always there, certain of themselves, sure about their sick, and sickening, beliefs, for truly, as Bertrand Russell brilliantly put it once: <BR>
<BR>
"The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts."<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your contribution, however. I of course don't yet believe you're but a hateful racist. Just don't be one, please, and don't listen, ever, to any of them. Keep honest, and free, if i may advise you. Your language is relatively respectable, and your content suggests that you are, hopefully, still capable of truth, and of love. Regards.<BR>

The first, is that you use a number of quotations by Israeli/Jewish authors.  The fact that one of these authors happens to have written a cook book doesn't deter you.  <BR>
<BR>
Secondly, just because I referred to 60% of jews coming from Arab lands, and that happens to coincide with your figure of 60% doesn't mean that I'm supporting your argument.  60% of Israeli Jews are Sephardic, meaning they are from everywhere BUT Europe (excluding Spain and Portugal).  You excluded a huge portion of jews from Iraq and Iran, Syria and Yemen, Egypt and Morroco (there was a Jewish community in Alexandria since its founding) who had been in those places since long before the Khazars converted to Judaism.  <BR>
<BR>
The problem with dismissing Jewish claims to Israel simply because they are the descendants of the Khazars is to ignore the reality that the Jews are a tribe, not just a religious group.  They are entitled to the land as much as a Jew who can trace his or her heritage to the hebrews of Israel.  To deny the jewish claim to Israel is to be anti-jewish, and racist.  Just as it is to deny Palestinians the right to a state.<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Thanks for your reply, and your appreciation. Here follows my comments.<BR>
<BR>
First, I believe deciding whether one is scientific, strictly scientific, first depends on one's introductory premise and main hypothesis in question. I'm totally unscientific, by the way, in my life, in my bedroom for example--in case there is any. But right here, I assure you, I am, at least, objective.<BR>
<BR>
Last time, I didn't at all mean to determine, or even discuss, the origin of the Jews, whether it's the kingdom of Khazaria or the planet Pluto; but to only emphasize the fact that your earlier claims against the Arabs in this regard were invalid, and to prove it wasn't a mere "ludicrous claim" as you graciously stated. <BR>
<BR>
In such a context, as clear, what first matters is the fact that my quotes all came from non-Arabs, rather from Israeli and Jews. And in this context, you, certainly, should have paid more attention to their words, thoughts and attitudes, than to whether they, in their life, for living or for fun, smilingly serve excellent pizza, or unsmilingly pose sniffy doctorates.<BR>
<BR>
As for the origin of today's Jews and how valid their claims to the land of Israel-Palestine are, I'm afraid this is, first, still off-topic; second, as I've already stated before, was never the topic I'm personally qualified to discuss or even maintain a final stance about. Scholars and specialists in this field, you must know, are in a terrible maze, so terrible they themselves usually avoid such an endless discussion. And scientifically speaking, this research actually deals with every shred of evidence from the very beginning, usually starts in the land of Kan'aan, not of Khazaria, before Moses was even born, even before Abraham himself once settled there, thousands of years ago.<BR>
<BR>
However, my stance and attitude, if you're concerned, are definitely clear, constant and consistent when it comes to the present situation. Inarguably, the people of Israel had made their historical mistake--just a new one--when they once allowed a gang of criminal soldiers, supported by disordered rabbis, to lead their nation today and to seal their, and their kids', fate. For this claim, I wish I could deal now with the rest of your message, somehow influenced by the confusion dominant in the public opinion and the media, on both sides. But unfortunately, this is still so irrelevant now and here, let alone controversial. Besides, we certainly don't have enough time, I wish we had, to discuss every controversy in the world. <BR>
<BR>
However, fair as you are now, objective as I think, and deep as you should always be, now please consider only one question, speaking of racism: how about a doctrine, any doctrine, that begins with the tenet that its members are God's Chosen People?<BR>
<BR>
*** *** ***<BR>
<BR>
Well... Thank you, once again. I've certainly enjoyed reading your challenging, and courageous, words. I'm accessible at Gamagold@hotmail.com, so let me please hear from you, and get a bit closer, as I might gratefully need your opinion on some stuff in the next few months. Take care and good night.<BR>

They cannot be blamed for their actions on September 11th -- it was an action taken in self-defense.  As victims, the terrorists need to be treated with respect and honor.
<BR><BR>
Instead of war, what we need is peace.  To implement this I suggest we make what is called a "peace offering."  We should erect two enormous skyscrapers in downtown Kabul and name them the World Peace Center.  Of course we will also pay for and construct the new "twin towers" ourselves.  Along with this, as a sign of good faith, we should destroy our entire military.  Every battleship, every helicopter, every tank, etc. disassembled and destroyed.  <a href="http://www.millionmommarch.org">Even our assault rifles should be destroyed</a>.
<BR><BR>
Once our military is destroyed, the world will understand that we are serious about peace.  Terrorists will stop attacking us because they will see the overflowing love in our hearts.  Jew and Arab will embrace each other with tears of joy, rather than fear.  Crime will fall, and no longer will we need to lock our doors at night.

You want to destroy every tank? What are you, Chamberlain? Appeasing terrorists will do nothing, but increase demands to a point where life is not livable. It is better to die than to live under the hands of criminals and cowards.
The terrorists won't see the love in our hearts, they'll see mushroom clouds as they place nukes in our cities, buildings falling, millions killed.

<BR>
Of course not. Just draft the innocents (i.e. the local christians) into your army and when you order them to attack someone else [presumably a non-muslim empire's territory, that is certainly part of Allah's Great Plan For The Islamic Universe etc] then the non-muslims of the evil heretic empire will kill them, simple.<BR>
<BR>
Or, are these 'islamic' empires not really 'islamic'? it's possible (probable, actually); to parallel, the USA isn't very 'christian' despite being run by fundamentalists (e.g. palestine; palestine, tinpot dictators in central/south america; palestine etc), although that's probably my catholic side damning fundamentalists to hell.<BR>
<BR>
(now that's not very catholic of me, is it. hrmph.<BR>

Now some misguided people may ask why the Koran says its OK to kill and eat jewish babies? <BR>
The point is that jewish babies are guilty merely by being born. Their parents renounced allah, and so have they. Feel free to <BR>
kill 77 jewish babies. Trust me, it helps.<BR>

Also there is a very modern joke in the Koran that is widely respected among islamic scholars:<BR>

"They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah), and (they also took as their lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded (in the Torah and the Gospel) to worship none but One Ilah (God i.e., Allah), La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshiped but He). Praise and Glory is to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)." <BR>

Now obviously that can be difficult and it shows. I am a non-muslim non christian living in a muslim country. This has provided me a different perspective on the religion everyone is discussing about. The author's article is laden (SORRY FOR THE PUN!)arrogance and superiority of christianity over Islam - refer Fasting for Ramadan: .....Note that this should not be confused with the HEALTHFUL, Christian practice of fasting. You're making a value judgment that what you practise is good and what another person praticising his or her faith is wrong or below you. I find that disappointing. Amidst all these tragic events of the past 2 months, I am beginning to inclined to think religion is a cruel affliction made by God (if there is one) to see how many of his creation stray from his peaceful teachings. We have Christians fighting against Catholics about Jesus and what he said about bread over the last supper. I mean, come on, Stop bickering about all these details and practise the true purpose of religion. Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Judaism ... notice how these 4 religions have always created conflict and wars between its people, even sometimes WITHIN its people. How sad is that! With the way things are going, our planet seems damned because of religion rather than being saved by it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

just one quick question: Do you hate the Islamic religion. From how I see it in your article, you potray Islam as the devil's teachings. "Islamicists" may be inclined to think your teachings are devilish in nature too. Your arrogance about Christianity being far superior than Islam is, lack of a better word, sickening. Try to be more OBJECTIVE next time you write an article. I don't care about you spewing facts to support your position. Facts can be manipulated and interpreted to suit your position, as have religious extremists who twist Islam into something hedious. I'm sorry but your article is rubbish(and I am a non muslim and non- christian commenting on this -I hope this will provide some objectivity into my comments).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Depending on what bits of these texts you choose, you can be a moderate tolerant nice guy or a frothing raving evil bastard.<BR>

Now, for a whole shitload of reasons, at this particular point in history*, the ratio of frothing bastards to nice guys is worse in Islam than in Christianity or Judaism. (In medieval times, the Islamic world was more rational and tolerant than Christendom).<BR>

However, using this ratio to argue that the Koran and Islam is inherently inferior is simply ignorant and does no good in the struggle to change the ratio for the better.<BR>
