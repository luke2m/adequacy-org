		The penal system has to include elements both of <a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/1984.htm">rehabilitation</a> and
<a href="http://www.rosieo.com">deterrence.</a>  Rehabilitation is
<a href="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6861.html">emphasized
heavily in the popular press,</a> because for true deterrence to
take place, inmates must be traumatized so as to be brought into
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/28/reviews/990228.28ander.html">empathy
with the victim.</a>  If the criminal cannot be made to feel the
pain of the victim, then he cannot really be brought to
repentance, and the victim's suffering is denigrated.  What we too often forget is that deterrence is a greater kindness to the one deterred than it is even to the people who otherwise would have become his or her victims.  Deterrence saves its lucky, anonymous beneficiaries from the suffering that comes with criminality - incarceration, yes, but worse, the awful condition of being deserving cast out from society.<p>The time has come for prison rape - our grimmest deterrent - to be applied to women as well as to men.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Any punishments penal authorities might inflict upon a criminal are weakened by being applied to a victim by the infinitely more powerful state.  No matter how heinous the criminal, he always undergoes punishment at the hands of the <a href="http://www.theelectricchair.com/">state</a> rather than at the hands of his <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/news/2000/07/07/story/0000042837">peers.</a>  Thus, the criminal will see himself as 'being the victim,' and
all his defense mechanisms - honed by years of <a href="http://www.christianity.com/CC/article/0,,PTID2228%7CCHID100546%7CCIID441716,00.html">denying
to himself responsibility for his own criminality</a> - will come into play. Homosexual prison rape is our ultimate social sanction against this mentality.  Look how many men refuse to commit crimes because they are scared of being raped.  It is degrading and emasculating, and it can be because it is an action clearly taken against the criminal by his social equals.  Thus, prison rape is true punishment within the prison community.<p>

Under the current system, no equivalent sanction applies for females.  Due to <a href="http://www.hbcollege.com/psych/core/student/research/girlviol.html">increasing violence among young girls,</a> an equivalent is sorely needed, for both its qualities as a deterrent (which protects those deterred from the negative effects of committing a crime) and as retribution (which allows the community catharsis.)  This clearly must change.<p>

As Brownmiller has so perceptively pointed out, <a href="http://www.zetetics.com/mac/rape.htm">rape is the primary mechanism through which men... perpetuate their dominance over women.</a>  (<i>Against Our Will,</i> 1975.)  It is clear that rape, as a phenomenon, is necessarily perpetrated by men against victims of either gender.  Penal authorities may not themselves participate in or directly condone rape if it is to have the desired impact, as a peer sanction.  The only obvious solution is mixed-sex prisons in which, under controlled circumstances, male inmates are allowed free rein.<p>Surely, rape must be as awful an experience for a woman as it is for a man, yet we deny women the benefits of institutionalized prison rape!  This failure of will on the part of our common polity has failed women, as the younger generation falls further and further into <a href="http://fatchicksinpartyhats.com">degradation and violence.</a>  Unless the punishment palliates the crime, we will never know justice.  The only way for the American government to give women the full benefits of our penal system is for it to stop condescending to them.  Women must be jailed and must suffer there just as do men, or society has failed them.  To do less is to do violence to the natural rights of women everywhere.<p>The patriarchy is dead.  Long live natural justice, and prison rape.      <br><br></div>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This proposal would simply be placing a band aid on the real problem. Indeed it would only serve to further expand the root of it, the fact that women are commiting violent acts against one another.<BR><BR>
By nature women are not violent. They do not promote war, they are not aggressive, they are not in constant competition with one another over the propagation of their genes. As is the case with the rest of the natural world, those traits tend to appear in the males of a species. Unfortunately, among humans the balance of nature has been upset by the misguided efforts of the feminist movement.<BR><BR>
Feminism (which should be renamed masculinism) pushes women to be more like men. It asks them to abandon their protective instincts and embrace the cutthroat world of men. It wants them to be hunters rather than gatherers. Is it any wonder that the products of such a bastardization of the human spirit will exhibit such peculiar traits? Women commiting crimes, it was totally unheard of before the feminist movement wrapped its tentacles around the minds of young girls.<BR><BR>
What we need to do, rather than promote more violence, is to encourage women to return to their traditional, not to mention more natural, roles as the matriarchs of the family. They should be bearing children and tending the stove, not climbing the corporate ladder or playing basketball on television. The blame for this problem rests squarely on the shoulders of the ill thinking leftist feminist movement, and they should damn well be punished for it.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

Who better to lay out a path to salvation than the ones who are already walking it?<BR><BR>
Since this feminist rot came upon us in increments, we should rid ourselves of it in increments. One of the methods the feminists used was to take steps to be sure that the minds of young children would be open to receive their pollution, thus we should take steps to erect a few barriers to it. If we could bring prayer back to our schools we could go a long way toward protecting our children during that vulnerable time. At the very least they could spend their free time in an organized prayer group instead of doing who-knows-what.<BR><BR>
Future steps: removal of bans on Christian displays on public property; a reigning in of the ACLU; allowing our Christian schools to receive the same taxpayer money as the public schools; repeal of laws against owning poisonous reptiles; putting the Ten Commandments up in prominent places in our schools and government offices; the relaxing of some of those insane EEOC regulations. All of these things would constitute small steps toward strengthening the traditional family and putting us back on the straight and narrow. The more women we can direct away from traditionally male societal roles the better.<BR><BR>
We may be on the way as I write this, what with President Bush's Office for Faith-Based and Community Initiatives and such, although I would much rather the government just get out of the way and let good people do good work.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

However, we must also remember that unlike men, women <a href="http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~lowman/ICSS/sigdif.htm">sometimes enjoy rape</a>. The effects of such an event occuring in the female prison system would have the opposite of the desired effect, sowing the seeds of pleasure in place of the sour fruit of retribution. <br>
<br>
We must look to our Democratic leaders in the Senate for the answer. They have recently passed an initiative to move the role of airport security away from unlicensed private practitioners and into the hands of trained, highly paid federal employees. So it must be with prison rapists. Only a trained and motivated federal worker, with say a pay scale of, say, GS-14 or better, could possibly be expected to successfully rape 50 to 100 female inmates per day <i>and guarauntee that none of them enjoy the experience</i>. Federal prison rapists would be trained in expert techniques such as forced, unlubricated sodomy and would be equipped with the very best equipment pioneered by New York State authorities - broom handles, plungers, and the like. <br>
<br>
Without federalization of the Prison Rape system, it will likely fall to the old Republican saw of "independent rape contractors", most of whom are <a href="http://www.tysongear.com/index1.html">rank, untrained amateurs</a>. Stand up now for equity in our federal prison system.<br>

Interestingly, recidivism has decreased for female inmates 15% in the last five years due to an increase of education and drug treatment...not being raped!! Statistically, 87% of all women incarcerated have been the victims of child sexual abuse and 98.5% have reported being raped.  Didn't seem to keep them from crime on the street did it?

So men are raped in prison, and are 45% less likely to commit crimes. Great.<br>
<br>
<tt>recidivism has decreased for female inmates 15% in the last five years</tt><br>
<br>
So women are not raped in prison, and are 15% less likely to commit crimes. That pretty much proves it, right there. The %35 advantage in recidivism loss by men over women is a direct consequence of the only difference in their incarceration: rape. <br>
<br>
Hopefully by instituting prison rape procedures, we can bring women in line with the remarkable 45% posted by the men. Until that time, they remain unserved by our corrections system and unfit for society.<br>

If perhaps you meant this to point out the insanity of a culture accepting prison rape, which US culture by and large does, I think this might be justified.  However, at no point in this article or even in subsequent comments does the author even hint at this.  It is presented as a straightforward justification for raping female inmates.
<br><br>
I don't think I even need to point out how empty all of this reasoning is.  However, not being as subtle as I <i>hope</i> the author thinks he is, just let me state my belief that the only way you are ever going to really improve people convicted of heinous crimes is to treat them with respect, (that is not to say that they should not be reminded of their own heinous criminal actions) and to try to make them aware of their own potential.
<br><br>
Dehumanizing prisoners through allowing rape is not the answer.  This method just reaffirms their current assessment of themselves, that they are worthless, drug dependant wrecks who are already so awful that doing horrific things to others doesn't seem like much of a step down.  The only real way to try to improve these people is to cultivate some value and self-love in them.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So, due to the fact it is illegal, and the effects of the <i>illegalisation</i>, pot smokers do harm to others? Seems you can make a much better argument that those who made the moronic legislation, primarily in order to protect Hurst's timber and paper interests, need to be punitively ass raped. They are, after all, the ones causing the ills you speak of.

Funny how some redneck Alabama jurist, or redneck Texas governer can blatantly flout the law without getting ass raped, or even threatened with ass rape, when their actions detrimentaly affect approximately 25% of the population yet pot smokers, whose actions affect only themselves, get no such protection.
<BR><BR>
And, needless to say to anyone with a brain, blind obedience to the law would mean slavery would still be with us. Your position casts the Union's war against the south as a violation of the sanctity of law. Your position casts the Freedom Riders, those participating in anti-segregation sit ins, and Rosa Parks as paragons of criminality.... worse than cop killers! A thinking man has an ethical obligation to flout unjust laws which hurt the cause of justice far more than breaking them does. That you consider the sanctity of ill conceived laws to mean more than the lives of policemen is telling.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

And your knowledge of the legality of the Civil War is laughably incompetent. Where in those oh so holy documents of incorperation does it ban seccesion? No-fucking-where. Where does it give the federal government the right to dictate to the states their position on slavery (an institution enshrined in the constitution)? No-fucking-where. In fact the 10th amendment specifically denies the federal government such power over the states. As for your quote unquote "state" comment, it was the US of A that recognized the CSA as a state. Read a damned book about it sometime, don't just parrot what some ignorant football coach told you in high school.
<BR><BR>
Slavery was a dead institution that had been in decline in the south for 40 years, it disapeared from Brazil in the 1880s without the deaths of half a million people to do it either.

This prooves that the true readership of adequacy.org is composed of either near-radical conservatives (with a good dash of good old christian fundamentalism thrown in here and there), and an entirely seperate group of people who can't stop looking at adequacy.org in the same way that people can't tear their eyes away from a particularly nasty 50 car pileup.<BR>
<BR>
At any rate, you're advocating anarchy, as you're suggesting that the 'natural order' we have come to accept (although I hate it when authors write on behalf of an unamed, unquantified group of people that I do not belong to but am unwillingly grouped with) inside prisons is actually the optimal and most socially benificial order. The only reason men rape men in jail, from my understanding, is that they need sex, and there are no females. So .. give the opportunity to males rape the females, and the males themselves would never get raped. I mean, this isn't even an eye-for-an-eye thing. All you'd end up with is drunk, sexually unsatisfied criminal male minds holding up more banks, so they can fuck whoever they want whenever they want in jail. I mean, shit, yeah, it might deterr a small small percentage of female would-be criminals, at the expense of the female criminal population. Nevermind that most criminals are capable of criminal acts for the very reason that they do not understand that their actions are wrong, or understand or consider the consequences of their actions.<BR>
<BR>
Shit, nathan, you'd only end up making jail look all the more tolerable for male criminals, who make up the majority of the fuckups on this planet anyhow.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No, it proves we have a wide variety of readers (much wider than many other sites we could name, despite, as yet, having far fewer readers). Note that many of the comments on this article are in opposition to the article's argument; we clearly aren't all in agreement.
<BR><BR>
Nathan is not an editor; he's a reader, like you. He submitted a story that was found unusual and interesting enough to post. Part of the point of the "News for Grown-ups" tag is that we don't shy away from controversial views, because adults can cope with unfamiliar ideas, unlike the children (some fully grown) who inhabit many other web sites, who are offended by ideas that differ more than minutely from their own.

You want prison rape to be allowed on women right. Not all women are there for crimes against nature,some women are in prison due to something as simple as a parole violation, and you want them to be raped. Now what signal is that sending out to these women once they are freed?? That rape is alright, that they are unowrth of having sex without loved involved, that they are cheap pieces of meat to be had by all. Maybe i am from a real far planet, but i have always been told that violence leads to more violence. I know that the detterence for women,as well as men, needs to be put in place, but rape is not the answer.<BR>
Also men don't not commit crimes to avoid going to jail and being raped, some men know what's right from wrong and want to do what's right in society. Some of the offenders were stoned on something when they committed these crimes and when the "stoned"effect was no longer with them, the crime was done. Yet other men just know their ass from a hole in the ground and want to be productive members of society for themselves, their families and society all the way around. <BR>
By the way i am a senior at a local university majoring in government and criminal justice, just didn't want you to think i was a woman with no background on the subject.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
