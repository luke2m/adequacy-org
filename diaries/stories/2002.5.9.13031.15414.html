		Numerous studies have shown that drug use among teenagers is a growing
problem. For instance, <A
HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1179000/1179060.stm">this</a> report claims that over 75% of youngsters have experimented with

balance of probability, <I>your</i> child is a drug user.<P>

Adequacy.org realises that parenting is often a difficult challenge and it

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><H1>Know your enemy</h1><P>

The first step in helping your son or daughter to overcome a drug
problem is to educate yourself about the nature of their addiction. To 
assist you, the following list gives you the essential background information 
on popular drugs, including their street names and the telltale signs   
of addiction.<P>

<B>Heroin</b><BR>
<I>Also known as: <a href="http://www.deano501.freeserve.co.uk/HProfile.htm">H</a> or smack</i><P>

Heroin is by far the most dangerous and addictive drug of all, causing 
tens of thousands of deaths worldwide every year. Heroin takes the form of
a white powder which the user smokes, either from a water-filled vessel
(known as a <I>hookah</i> or <I>bong</i>) or from a homemade cigarette    
(known as a <I>reefer</i>, <I>joint</i> or <I>roach</i>). If your child   
has started smoking, it is almost certain that he/she is also hooked on  
heroin.<P>

Despite being dangerous, heroine is also very expensive and a single dose
may cost as much as £100 ($70). The high cost of heroin inevitably causes
addicts to turn to crime to fund their habit. Stealing and prostitution
are two common crimes perpetrated by heroin abusers. If your son
frequently stays out at night beyond curfew, it is possible that he is 
using the cover of darkness to burgle or commit robberies. Alternatively, 
if you find condoms or contraceptive pills in your daughter's bedroom, she
may be working as a prostitute to pay for her next fix of heroin.<P>

Heroin abuse is typically accompanied by listening to "repetitive beat
music", which may sometimes be called "ambient", "electronica", "hip-hop",
"house", "rave"  or "techno".<P>

<B>Crack</b><BR>
<I>Also known as: Jack, Charlie or coke</i><P>

Crack is a relatively new drug, which is mass-produced in factories in
Eastern Europe, South America or Asia. Thanks to the economies of scale 
made possible by these vast illicit sweatshops, crack is a relatively
inexpensive narcotic, costing about £3 ($2) per crack.<P>
Crack comes in the form of a small, brown pellet that both looks and
smells like licorice. Pellets of crack are typically chewed, sucked or
swallowed whole. Since crack abusers often try to disguise the distinctive
smell of the drug on their breath, the use of chewing gum is a warning
sign that your child is addicted to crack.<P>

Crack addicts prefer listening to rock music, which may take the form of
"death metal", "goth", "heavy metal", "industrial", "punk" or "thrash
metal".<P>

<B>Psychedelics</b><P>

Several different narcotics fall under the umbrella of "psychedelic  
drugs":

<UL>
<LI>Cannabis <I>AKA: marijuana, hashish, weed, wacky baccy or dope</i>  
<LI>Ecstasy <I>AKA: MDMA, E, X, meth or crank</i>
<LI>LSD <I>AKA: acid</i>
</ul><P>

Despite their different chemical compositions, all of these drugs cause  
the user to experience terrifying hallucinations. The effect of these
hallucinations is so intense that long-term misuse of psychedelic drugs  
causes memory loss, mental illness and alopecia.<P>

The warning signs that your child may be abusing psychedelic drugs are
more apparent than for other drugs: long hair, facial hair, loose-fitting
clothing, ear/body piercings and tattoos are all reliable indicators that
your son or daughter is addicted to psychedelics.<P>

Music is an essential part of the psychedelic "experience". If your child
regularly listens to music from the 1960s, it is likely that drug-induced
hallucinations are forcing him/her to vainly attempt to relive the <A HREF="http://www.woodstock69.com">Summer
of Love</a>.<P>

<H1>Gathering evidence</h1>
After reading the preceding lowdown on drugs, you may have recognised   
some of the warning signs that your child is a drug addict. Your
suspicions may be aroused further when your son asks you for money.
Perhaps he needs this money to pay his drug dealer? Is your daughter
struggling at school? This could be due to brain damage caused by
addiction to narcotics. Alternatively, if your child shows <A HREF="http://www.arsenal.co.uk">little sporting
ability</a>, this may be due to the toxic side-effects of drug abuse.<P>

If you suspect that your child may be hooked on drugs, it is your duty to
find evidence of his/her habit. Some effective strategies for
investigating your child's addiction include:
<UL>
<LI>Thoroughly search your child's bedroom, leaving no stone unturned.
Don't forget to look under the bed and in drawers, wardrobes and the
pockets of clothing.
<LI>If your daughter keeps a diary, use this to your advantage. Read her
diary to gain an insight into her lifestyle and her circle of friends. You
may discover that her "boyfriend" is really her dealer or pimp.
<LI>If your son uses the Internet, read his email. Don't forget to read
outgoing email, not just those he has received from others. Check the
"History" of web pages he has visited, to look for further incriminating
evidence.
<LI>Try to overhear your child's telephone calls. Listen out for key  
phrases, such as the street names of drugs.
<LI>Talk to your child's teachers, to find out if they have noticed any abnormal behaviour. Remember that teachers share your concern for the
wellbeing of your offspring, and they will be pleased to assist with your 
investigations.
</ul>

At this stage, do not attempt to ask your child directly about his drug 
habit. 

<H1>How to help your child</h1>

Once you have gathered evidence that your son or daughter is a drug
addict, it is time to take swift and decisive action. Be warned, your
child will lie to you and will try to convince you that he is not
abusing drugs. Remember that your child is in the grip of powerful
mind-altering substances and will stop at nothing to ensure that he gets
his next fix. Do not listen to these lies!<P>

Countless medical studies have shown that "<A HREF="http://www.parentsplace.com/expert/lactation/qas/0,10338,166428_108793,00.html">cold turkey</a>" (i.e. immediate
withdrawal from the drug) is the most effective way to beat addiction.
Attempts to gradually wean an addict from the source of his addiction, by
using a substitute such as methodone for example, inevitably fail and
should therefore not be considered. To ensure that your child overcomes
his addiction, you must act on his behalf to distance him from his
drug-abusing lifestyle. The best way to achieve this is to:

<UL>
<LI><B>Ground your child.</b> Your child will not be able to abuse drugs
while confined to the safe and loving family home.
<LI><B>Stop your child's allowance.</b> If your child has no money, she
will not be able to buy drugs.
<LI><B>Confiscate computers, mobile phones and cars.</b> Ensure that your
child has no means of communicating with his so-called friends who have
led him astray.
<LI><B>Take your child to school each morning</b> and collect him at the
end of the school day. Ask teachers to keep your child alone in a locked
classroom at lunchtime. This will ensure that your child has no contact
with undesirable influences.

I hope this article will serve as a useful guide in helping you to cure
your child's drug addiction. I wish you the best of luck and I hope
your child experiences a speedy recovery!

<br><br>
Personally, I find that this does not go far enough, and the little bastards are still capable of getting their fix of "cake". Therefore I have instituted a "zero tolerance" policy in my household.
<br><br>
The key factor to this policy is permanent nudity in the family home. Obviously I would not put my children out on the street naked, but once they return from school, their clothes are hung up with their shoes and bags, in the porch. This has cause the drug-intake in my house to plummet. In their natural form, I can also see if my children have been injecting in their veins, or if any parts of their body have "melted" (one of the side-effects of taking "cake").
<br><br>
Unfortunately, this scheme is still not 100% effective, as my children are still somehow taking drugs, so I have recently begun a regime of cavity searches before bedtime. I know it sounds harsh, but I love my children, and I do not want them to become mere statistics in the War against Drugs.

Presumably one of the "differences" between children and teenagers would be that teenagers are "teen-aged", i.e. between 13 and 19.

According to who ever wrote this, 75% of youngsters have experimented with Drugs.<BR>
<BR>
75% of which Nation. Half the world's youngsters can't even get food never mind drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Also If I smoke, Use gum and have long hair I'm addicted to Heroin, Crack, Ecstasy, Acid and Dagga<BR>
<BR>
Plus the children listening to 60's music is a good indicator. For Pete's sake The 60's where days of Heroin, Coke, etc not really E and A. (Even though E was first legally used in Europe as far back as 1900 as a Diet pill)<BR>

<BR><BR>
A recent trend has seen substances, which can be nothing but illegal, appear in local convenience stores, supermarkets, and gas stations around the globe.  These products claim to "provide a kick of energy", or otherwise "energize" a person upon consumption.  Perhaps the most well known of these new beverage-drugs is called <b><a href="http://www.redbull.com/">Red Bull</a></b>.  <b>Red Bull</b>, a drink by an Austrian company of the same name, is named after a famous Cherokee Indian Chief who was known for massive opium usage.  Red Bull is marketed at today's teen who needs an "extra rush of energy".
<BR><BR>
What parents aren't aware of is just how dangerous these beverages are.
<BR><BR>
As a chemist, I have had a unique opportunity to examine this product for myself.  In each can of Red Bull, there exists a trace concoction of 90% <b>Ephedrine</b> (which in itself has been <a href="http://lawtomation.com/leflawnet/ephedrine/">linked with stroke and cardiac arrest</a>)and 10% <b>Methamphetamine</b>.  That's right, <b>Methamphetamine</b>.  Speed, Meth, Ice, Fire, Glass.  How have the makers of Red Bull been able to sell this product through the market?
<BR><BR>
Deception.
<BR><BR>
Red Bull claims that their beverage contains <b>Taurine</b>, an essential amino acid.  Ask any respected chemist, and they'll tell you that Taurine is just as real as Fullerene.  Taurine comes from the latin "<i>Taurus-</i>", or Bull; and "<i>-ine</i>", or juice.  Literally, they are selling our children drugs powerful enough to stimulate a 1400lb bull -- not an amino acid as they claim.
<BR><BR>
How are they capable of getting away with this, you ask?  Wouldn't the <a href="http://www.fda.gov">Food and Drug Administration</a> step in and claim foul play?  While I cannot assume government kickbacks, I know that Red Bull is an Austrian company, so I would assume foul play is involved.
<BR><BR>
Parents, I urge you to check your child's beverage consumption.  If you find a can of Red Bull, your child may be strung out at that very moment.  Make no mistake -- your child is intelligent enough to consume an entire bottle of Cough Syrup for the hallucinogenic <a href="http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm.shtml">DXM</a> within -- don't assume he or she wouldn't consume an entire case of Red Bull to get his speed fix.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Weed has been proven, time and time again by respected scientists, to be the #1 drug related menace facing society today. While The Weed itself will not necessarily produce the debilitating effects that interveinous herion injection will, your child will almost certainly end up moving on to much harder drugs after a short period of experimentation with The Weed. Even if he or she is among the 2% or so Weed users who don't end up on crack they will no doubt suffer lifelong disability from smoking just a few joints.<BR><BR>

Let me relate a little story: I was once a model young person. I was involved in a number of extracirricular activities, got good grades, and was on track to get into an Ivy league school. I played baseball, the American pastime. I went to church regularly. My clothes were trendy and so were my friends. Almost no acne appeared on my face.<BR><BR>
One day my virgin girlfriend and I were driving downtown in my convertible on our way to the zoo. Upon arriving in the parking lot a young man appeared out of nowhere, wearing a black Anthrax T shirt and cheap shoes, obviously a disadvantaged inner city youth. Before I could offer him a 'salvation card' my church had provided me for just such an occasion he said "Want to go to a bake sale at 4:20?".<BR><BR>
A bake sale? Being the eager to contribute to any cause we could both my virgin girlfriend and I jumped at the opportunity.<BR><BR>

To make a long story short, there was no bake sale, that was just code for smoking Weed and before we could turn around and run both my girlfriend and I had caught a contact high. By approximately 4:30 my girlfriend had lost her virginity in the back seat of my Saab 900, she ended up working in the porn industry instead of going to Columbia like she was supposed to, I barely graduted from high school because I spent most of my time stealing radar detectors and car stereos, I have virtually no recollection of a two year period of my life that friends tell me I spent drinking malt liqour and concocting various blends of drugs in a bent spoon. At one point a few of the friends who's lives I didn't destroy locked me in a cellar as an 'intervention', only to find out that it contain approximately 10 cases of wine, which I consumed in short order to fuel the drug induced fire of self destruction that had taken over my body. Luckily these friends had some guts, because they left me in there until I had consumed all the wine, sobered up, and gone through the lengthy period of withdrawal that all Weed addicts have to face sooner or later.<BR><BR>

Keep my story in mind if you decide to comment on Mr. iat's article. You addicts might have a bone to pick because he isn't up on the latest street jargon, but the gist of the thing is spot on. Stay the hell off drugs. Science, and personal experience, has shown that they only bring misery.

I don't see how you could figure that there is a 2% rate of people who don't end up on crack from smoking pot. If that was true than 65% of the US would be crack addicts. You need to get your facts straight.<BR>
   I know its hard for you to grasp (being a complete lamer and all), but your friends, and probably people in your family have tried pot. They may not admit it, but I would bet you that is the case.<BR>
   For yor information, many European countries surgeon generals (even in our own country), have stated that marijuana can be beneficial in dealing with fatigue in cancer and aids patients. It can induce hunger in anorexic (maybe it could help your "ex-virgin" girlfriend.<BR>
   I would also bet you that your girlfriend didn't end up in the porn business because of pot, but as a result of the supression of sexual expression, and probably from being locked up by her (obviously) over-religious, opressive parents.<BR>
    Another thing I dont understand is why you treat sex as a dirty thing. You wouldn't be here if there was no sex. Apparently your balls were chopped off and you were fed estrogen tabs, cause you act like a fucking nun. I mean, I'm a chick and I am more sexed than you. <BR>
   You also must be obsessive compulsive, cause marijuana is NOT physically addictive, and if you have a Saab (get a real car, you pussy), and a girlfriend who was supposed to go to columbia, one would have to suppose you were wealthy, and therefore would not need to steal car sterios to support your obsessive habit with a relatively inexpensive (*cough*dirt cheap*cough*) drug.<BR>
   Your story (as that seems to be all it is) is full of inadequacies, and all it makes you is ignorant (not suprising for someone who goes to church bake sales). Why don't you do your research in the future before wasting peoples time with your bullshit propaganda, obviously information given to you by D.A.R.E (the very allies of a law enforcement institution (CIA) who has been seen (by me), buying a schmorgasboard of drugs in the wonderful country of Belize.) It is all a bullshit method of providing  reverse psychology mindwashing, so you'll go out and buy the drugs.<BR>
   Oh, by the way, please kill yourself, because all you are doing is wasting the holy air that your ficticious god has blessed us all with.<BR>

My I also point out kids joke about drugs everyday, it may sound like your son or daughter is talking about drugs over the phone it could be something totaly different. If you want to really catch them try checking their eyes if they aren't clear they have just use some type of drug in the last hour. Let me also say this please please try not to over reacted on your children unless you got hard proof then beat the living crap out of them, my brother may the mistake of not checking everything out he thought because of his son strange behavoir he was doing or worse dealing drugs, it ended up he worried over nothing his son was just planning his suprize birthday party(yes people still throw them).

He has had nowhere near the exposure to wannabe hippies and dopeheads I've had and probably doesn't truly appreciate what he's saying. The thing is most jokes about drugs are done in a context that makes them seem acceptable. In my mind drug related jokes are as borderline as jokes based on racism, even more so. At least racist jokes can usually be taken with a grain of salt but drug related jokes, when coming from my brother, make me uneasy. I usually do my best to grind such jokes into the ground which isn't always that easy when you're trying to be overt about it but not too overt. When somebody else makes drug related jokes however I usually choose to ignore it. Instead I just let my respect for that person slip. The mindset that comes along with these types of jokes is responsible for such atrocities as Tom Green and Scary Movie.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<ul><li>Heroin is usually injected, sometimes sniffed or burnt on aluminum foil and inhaled (the fumes) which is not really smoking</li>
<li>As far as i know, crack is usually white not brown and coke is not a slang name for crack. Although crack is made out of cocaine (coke), it's much more addictive and harmful</li>
<li>This is even more devestating than heroin. It's not chewed but smoked in a crackpipe</li>
<li>Ecstacy is not a psychedelic, and weed isn't really either. You forgot mushrooms (shrooms), which are very popular</li></ul>
In my teens i have used several kinds of drugs. Marijuana on a daily basis for years in a row, and i've experimented with ecstacy and shrooms. These are all listed here in the psychedelics category. Well i'm a fan of Jimi Hendrix so that proves the truth of this article, which is brilliant besides the minor flaws mentioned earlier. Keep up the good work guys.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Grounding your child-Grounding leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to running away<BR>
<BR>
Stop child's allowance-5 finger discount, pick-pocket, playing guitar on street, GETTING A JOB<BR>
<BR>
Confiscate computers, mobile phones and cars-School, walking, actual face to face commmunication<BR>
<BR>
Take your child to school each morning-Asking the teacher to watch him all day is impossible, if the kid is in high school it would be like finding a needle in the haystack, this is the most easiest one to beat<BR>

Just because your grounded, it does not stop you from getting up your stuff, opening the window and jumping out. Theres also getting your stuff, telling your parents that your leaving, opening the door and giving them the middle finger salute before going outside.

<BR>
speaking of financing and training terrorists the US certainly hasn't had any qualms about that before (Osama being CIA trained and everything - the eneny of our enemy isn't necessarily our friend as much as the politicians wish they were). as far as Columbia and Latin America the late US School of Americas (now Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation) sure has terrorized innocent, [and sometimes] war-weary civilians. "among the SOA's nearly 60,000 graduates are notorious dictators Manuel Noriega and Omar Torrijos of Panama, Leopoldo Galtieri and Roberto Viola of Argentina, Juan Velasco Alvarado of Peru, Guillermo Rodriguez of Ecuador, and Hugo Banzer Suarez of Bolivia. Lower-level SOA graduates have participated in human rights abuses that include the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero and the El Mozote Massacre of 900 civilians." (http://soaw.org)<BR>
<BR>
drugs are just inanimate objects they are not inherantly bad, although they do however have the potential for misuse (and what doesn't?). we should concentrate on fixing the problem at the roots (bad US policies based on misinformation) before we try to use drugs as a scapegoat.<BR>
<BR>
and you only referred to cocaine and heroin. he was talking about smoking pot. since about half of the bud in the US is homegrown with the vast majority of the remainder coming from Canada and Mexico (the actual percentage's vary depending on location) i'd say he can be quite sure he isn't hurting anyone but himself, and the degree to which he is doing that is arguable.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Afghanistan is not the same thing as a group of militant islamics, opressing the good people of that country. All you are doing by saying that stuff is making yourself look stupid. Afghanistan is a poor opressed country, controlled by assholes. As for the drugs, it is a capitalistic venture for dealers in various sectors of the law enforcement institutions, and drug dealers, but a way of providing food for the families of those who farm drugs there.<BR>
Extacy and meth are tough to synthesize and most of the materials used in the synthesis of these drugs are not openly availible to a poor afghani farmer. That is unfounded propaganda. Most methamphetamine is created in "meth labs" in desert areas in places like California and Arizona. Extacy is sythesized in illegal labs by people with knowledge of chemistry... in basements. Psyclobin or "psychadelic  mushrooms" are found in vast quantities in cow pastures around the country. Since a majority of Afghanistan is void of green and moisture rich cow pastures (there is a lot of desert), it would be hard to grow and harvest shrooms. The effects also deteriorate with age, therefore making it hard to export.  Please look this stuff up.. it makes you look really lame<BR>

Treatment for this deplorable condition consists of pre-emptory tactics: Fill your child with drugs WHICH YOU CONTROL. A dose of thorazine, mixed with valium, seconal and paregoric, will place the drug use under YOUR control; once you have control, you can prevent the delinquent from using other drugs by the simple fact that (s)he is already loaded! and there is NO MORE ROOM.<BR>
Similarly, if you are troubled about your children having sex, a pre-emptive strike (sell them to your local Hells Angels for an evenings entertainment) will place their coital behavior under YOUR control, and take away their appetite for f****** their schoolmates.<BR>
This valuable technique has many applications; you may be able to think of many more.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

When reading some of the comments below the story I hope dearly that most of you were not serious in your replies.  That or I guess you are all under "Junior Bush's FreeMason Reign of Terror"(JBFRT).  On a more serious note I do believe that drug abuse is a problem, but due to the sheepitus sweeping the North American political scenes it is obvious that drug policy will always remain in blatant ignorance to the fact that if there is a demand, there will <b>always</b> be a supply.  I'm not writing to suggest a legalize-all policy, but I am suggesting a overhaul of the current out-of-date drug policies in North America.  On a side note of interest Heroin was first brought in mass quantities to the States(Harlem) during the Vietnam war. The heroin was transported in dead G.I. bodies.  I ask a question.  Would you rather have people buy drugs from these people, or the government?  Which is the lesser evil?  I do not know.

In fact, I'm almost on the verge of involving myself in an extremely minor smuggling operation myself - because Snus (a Scandinavian form of chewing tobacco) is not legal in Britain, despite the relative benefits compared to smoking tobacco, I'll have to ask a friend to bring some from Sweden if I want some. I can't understand why it's not legal - it's negative effect on health is negligible compared to that of cigarettes. This is one reason I want some - if I can't quit using tobacco, I can at least start using a less harmful form.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

True, it's better not to chew at all than to use any form of tobacco, but I think there's a lot smaller chance of getting ANY kind of cancer from the use of Snus rather than smoking - after all, all I'm putting in my mouth is dried-up plant material rather than synthetic filters containing god-knows-what, paper and smoke containing ridiculous numbers of carcinogens.<BR><BR>

That's why I'd prefer to start using Snus rather than smoking. I may still be addicted to nicotine, but I feel I'd find it easier to stop using Snus than smoking. Add to that the advantage of its lower price and I'd say there are benefits <i>relative to smoking</i>.
<BR><BR>
I also made a slight factual error - Snus isn't actually "chewed", it's rolled into a small ball and placed between the gum and lower lip.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

OK people, here is the truth:<BR>
<BR>
1. Heroin is bad. I used it once, it was a wonderful experience, BUT, I really barely stopped myself from using it again. I am serious. It is incredibly addictive. DON'T USE IT!<BR>
<BR>
2. LSD is good for some people. Some others don't like it. I use it couple of times a year. It can give cause terrifying halucinations but if you use it when you are happy, with your friends, in NATURE, it is very very  nice. It opens up some part in your brain that you never use before. You can see the music, touch the smells etc. So, try it. But be careful of bad trips. If you feel like negative thoughts are coming, think something you like, talk to your friends.<BR>
<BR>
3. I personally prefer mushrooms to LSD. They are natural, which is good. The bad thing about mushrooms is that you never know how much you should eat, since it differs from plant to plant. So, don't eat hundreds. Try and find the most pleasurable dosage. Again, use it in nature, with your friends, while you are happy.<BR>
<BR>
4. Extasy is a very nice drug. Everybody should try it. I am trying not to overdo it, one in a month or in two months. It takes you to totally different state of mind. You feel the music much better, and incredibly energetic. You can communicate with other "high" people in a way which is not known to you before. So, it is really hard to describe. It can be bad if it is too strong. For example, it makes you grind your teeth. If you feel it, grab a chewing gum. But don't chew aggresively. Another thing: You learn how to gracefully go high after min 5 usages. So, first times use it with your friends. You may need to be taken care of since it may cause you to find yourself in unwanted situations. Well, for example, it can make you incredibly horny. I know one straight guy why had sex with 3 men after using it. :) (Would not be a problem for me since I am bi though.) So, be careful. One more point, extasy is in general not pure MDMA, but a coctail. They put speed in it, and sometimes Katamin. If there is a lot of katamin in it, you can see mild hallucinations. MTV pills for example, are like that. The bad thing about extasy is, post trip crash. When you start going down, you feel awful. You feel paranoia, you feel everything sucks etc. Smoking a joint is a requirement while coming down!<BR>
<BR>
5. Speed: Its ok. But not my type. Amphetamines are nice if you don't use them much and very frequent. But, metamphetamins like Pico, I don't like them. I tried it once, it made me eat the insides of my mouth. So, stick to normal or liquid speed if you like this genre.<BR>
<BR>
6. Cocain and Crack: Crack is made from Cocain. It is much more stronger, and very harmful to your body. But you feel like a king of the jungle. I tried crack couple of times, but afterwards, I decided to not to do it, since it was not something really very special. <BR>
<BR>
Cocain is very expensive, and incredibly common drug. 80 percent of the people in show business: singers, models, directors, djs etc. use cocain. I am in it, so I know. There are different ways of getting cocain. You can sniff it, smoke it, inject it. Sniffing is the most common, and less addictive. If you inject, you can get seriously addicted. So, do it without fear if you can control yourselves. I am using it sometimes, only sniffing. It gives you a very natural "highness". You trust you more. You can express yourself more. If you feel you are getting addicted, stop for sometime. I know some people who are seriously addicted. Their eyes become open and never close down. :) Really, use it with pleasure, but do not let it use you.<BR>
<BR>
7. Marihuana. It is not a drug, it is a plant. I even grown them in my house. First of all, it is not addictive. The effects: You feel good! You can understand music much much better. You hear sounds in music that normally do not hear. There are music types, for which it is required to smoke joints to enjoy. And, you feel peace, and understand how stupid war and politicians are. You cannot hate anything when you are stoned. Also, it makes you think and think and think. If you use it with extasy, your imagination hits the skies. :) It is extremely common. 80 percent of the musicians use it. I am living in Europe, and here, in every club, you can freely smoke joints. I personally feel like alcohol is much worse than marihuana. I think everybody MUST smoke joints to understand peace. The world would be much better place if they did. It is gonna be legalized soon any way.<BR>

<BR>
All cannabinoids but Delta 11 and Delta 9 THC are mostly inactive psychopharmacologically and do not seem to exert potentiating or other effects. <BR>
<BR>
As cannabis gets older, THC gradually breaks down to CBN, which is not psychoactive.<BR>
<BR>
There´s also a precursor to THC in the plant, cannabidiol(CBD), which is mostly present in non-drug hemp. It can also bepresent in high quantities in bad hashish. This is probably the one that gets you stoned instead of high. It´s presence is normally inversely correlated to that of THC and it gets you stoned instead of high. It can also decrease the effects of THC.<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hi there,<BR>
<BR>
I have been accessing your site regularly in view of finding accuracy and information.<BR>
<BR>
I am however very disappointed to see your article "Exploding the Myths of Teenage Drug Use" as I have now lost total faith in all your articles and feel very concerned that such inaccuracy on your site may well have been prevalent in other articles that I trusted the content of.<BR>
<BR>
Where exactly did you get your facts? perhaps if they were authorities this is why the drug scene is so strong amongst our teenagers simply bacuase if you got these "facts" from authorities they are also not equipped to help anybody.<BR>
<BR>
Heroin<BR>
Also known as: H or smack<BR>
- Heroin is not smoked in a bong, marijuana is smoked in a bong where the marijuana smoke is filtered through bong water to cool the smoke and remove oily impurities called THC (which is the key ingredient the makes you high), in addition the terms reefer, joint or roach are also applicable to marijuana and have nothing to do with Heroin.  Heroin is in fact melted in a spoon and sucked up by a syringe and then injected into a main artery often the tracks are seen in the inner arm, inner thigh, inside ankle and you can even find Heroin addicts inject it under the eyelid, finger nails and toenails.  It can be smoked however is not smoked in a cigarette, reefer, joint or roach, it is in fact laid inside a roll of tinfoil which again is melted and the fumes from the surface are inhaled through a straw referred to as free-basing, where you got these facts I am not sure?<BR>
<BR>
- If you find condoms and contraceptives in your daughters draw it may be directly related to the fact the teenagers are engaging in sex at the age of 16 just as you and your friends were in the 60's.  It could also mean that it is time to realise that your child is paying heed to the warnings of HIV/AIDS and is in fact being responsible at a very young age to take it upon herself to protect herslf against life destroying effects like pregnancy at an early age, or AIDS, give her some credit in a more mature society, to assume she is a prostitute is being the most immature parenting I've ever heard about.  In addition to which teenagers who have turned to prostitution to fund a drug habit would have sold all your jewelery and furniture before turning to sex slavery, perhaps you can see these as your first signs.<BR>
<BR>
- Heroin is not usually associated with music as it is a serious drug and not a scene drug,   Naturally you don't know your music either, perhaps the authorities never catch the heroin users because they are looking in the wrong place<BR>
<BR>
Crack<BR>
Also known as: Jack, Charlie or coke<BR>
<BR>
- Rocks, you buy crack in rocks not "per crack"<BR>
- Crack is the combination of cocaine boiled (or cooked) with baking soda.  It comes in the form of white crystals and smells nothing like sweets.  The crystals are very distinctive and if you ate one you'd probably die.  Actually crack or crack cocaine is smoked and free-based as is heroin.  Crack is usually smoked in a bottle neck which is broken off a glass bottle.  The distinctive signs of your child smoking crack is loss of weight, burn marks (from the glass bottle) around the lips and inside skin between the forefinger and thumb.  Crack also causes very bad skin and often leads to acne side effects and bad scaring. In addition, they do not care to hide it so they withdraw from the family and you rarely see a crack addict child partake in the family unit.<BR>
- Chewing gum is a favourite of all teenagers and is specifically designed to disguise bad breath, that's it's purpose the world over, perhaps your child is chewing gum because half the world is, it is no sign of crack abuse, what kind of general statement is this?<BR>
<BR>
Psychedelics<BR>
<BR>
Several different narcotics fall under the umbrella of "psychedelic<BR>
drugs": however marijuana & ecstacy is not one of them, Cannabis AKA: marijuana, hashish, weed, wacky baccy or dope - can make you hallucinate on the very odd occassion (after copiuos amounts are smoked or eaten), it is not considered a Psychedelic drug and is meant to be classified in it's own category if anything the same as alcohol as it's effects are that of a sensory inhibitor just the same as alcohol.  Marijuana is smoked to get you "stoned" which is dulls your senses and causes you to laugh, it is not smoked as a psychedelic drug. Hallucinations are an uncommon side effect.  <BR>
<BR>
* Ecstasy AKA: MDMA, E, X, meth or crank - has no hallucinogenic properties at all. In addition MDMA is a component of Ecstacy and is a drug all on it's own and is not another name for ecstacy.  Meth is a form of crystals that are an entirely different drug and has no resemblance to ecstacy what so ever. Crank must be an American term as I have never heard it in my life.<BR>
<BR>
 LSD AKA: acid - One of three common known Psychedelic drugs.  And these are classified as such, namely magic mushrooms, lsd & pyote (cactus when eaten induces hallucinations), Marijuana and Ecstacy are not psychedelic and are not classified as such (unless of course you are an authority then you may group them but in the real world they are not the same).  Acid is a chemical which is painted onto cardboard and then cut into little squares approximately 5mm in width. It is meant to produce hallucinations.  Yes you can have terrifying experiences but it is generally taken to induce a good experience, probably the same as getting drunk or getting alcohol poisoning and having to have your stomach pumped. Magic Mushrooms are naturally grown on what they call a cake.  They are mildly poisonous but not deadly, the allergic reaction to Magic mushrooms is what causes the hallucinations. Pyote is a South American cactus that will enduce Hallucinations lasting up to 4 days.  This is similar to what the red indians have been using for centuries for their spritual guides and trance sessions. Long Term misuse of LSD causes crystalisation in the spinal fluid and can cause physical effects after long term abuse, long lasting effects that are assumed but not proven are shortened tempers and heightened sensitivity to external stimuli, over reactions. Memory loss is associated with Marijuana and has nothing to do with hallucinogenics.  You cannot tell when your child is taking any of the hallucinogenics until such time as you catch them when they are physically on it, barring these symptoms there are no symptoms when not using. When on acid the child will be distracted, focussing for lengths of time on inanimate objects and the pupils will be dilated and the eyes will be wide open. Acid also causes a heightened alertedness.  <BR>
<BR>
- "Music is an essential part of the Psychedelic "experience". If your child regularly listens to music from the 1960s, it is likely that drug-induced hallucinations are forcing him/her to vainly attempt to relive the Summer of Love" - At this point your facts are so far fetched I cannot believe that you are associating clothing, hairstyles and music specifically from the 60's to drug abuse. Does this mean that if you listen to music other than rave, ambient, techno, rock, heavy metal, and all the other prime examples given that you are in fact an alcoholic.  Perhaps it would surprise you to know that most influential society goers who support theatre and classical orchestras are Cocaine addicts and that many celebreties are taking cocaine. In addition to which the increase in cocaine abuse is occuring in the higher earning level bracket, also that at least 60% of stock brokers who control the world's economy are cocaine addicts... mmm pause for thought?<BR>
<BR>
Gathering evidence<BR>
- If your son asks you for money, Perhaps he wants to go to the movies? <BR>
- If your child is struggling at school maybe she is needing your added attention as she is being picked on by fellow students or dislikes the teacher, perhaps her aptitude lies in arts and not physics. <BR>
- If your child shows little sporting ability, perhaps your child dislikes sports and has no sporting ability<BR>
<BR>
As a parent if you are suspecting your child of taking drugs, I would suggest you phone your local drug councilling centre and get valuable knowledgable advise, this guy has no idea what he is talking about and it could be detrimental to your relationship with your child if you are looking for feable excuses for signs of drug abuse instead of warrented signs that will enable you to help your child.  Don't worry about music preference, if you don't have a preference in music why create music, everyone has to have something to listen to it doesn't mean they are drug addicts.  <BR>
<BR>
When your child withdraws from the family unit and has physical side effects like drastic changes in temperement, personality, weight, skin condition, burn marks and ulcers on the hands and mouth, needle tracks and stained finger nails then phone the right official authorities, otherwise reading articles like "Exploding the Myths of Teenage Drug Use" can actually cause you to misinterrpret normal teenager activities and destroy your relationship with your child, or the alternative, trying to help your child with false statements and mis-informed facts can cause you to miss the real signs and you may end up with a dead child... <BR>
<BR>
Personally after this article of lies and rubbish with no facts whatsoever has caused me to never return to this site, as all other articles are probably just as inaccurate. <BR>
<BR>
If you are wanting to delete my response because it is not what you want to hear then you are placing children around the world in grave danger.  <BR>
<BR>
I am a mother of three children, I have just spent the last 5 years of my life rehabilitating my 15 year old from drug abuse, of which it started with alcohol abuse and lead to drug abuse.  She has taken just about every drug in this article and had I taken your suggestions my child would be dead today.  I am knowledgable because my child's life was on the line.  She is for now rehabilitated but the fact is she will always be an abuser she's just not using it now.  <BR>
<BR>
Go to the correct authorities, go the tough love route but seek professional advise and remember your child is a victim of a disease and she can only help herslef you can aid but she has to decide, forcing your child, searching her room, grounding her, all these things will distance her and cause her death. The local drug abuse centre will help you issue tough love in the correct manner which will save her life.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

....what they are dealing with. I am the guy who talks about how you feel when you use drugs 2 (or 3?) posts ago.<BR>
<BR>
I like using drugs, and can control myself. I use drugs, but don't let drugs use me. I am 28 years old. I am strongly against teenage hard-drug use. <BR>
<BR>
Smoking joints are ok, but eating extasies etc. are NOT OK for under 20 y.o.'s. They are really strong drugs, and teenagers cannot have a sense or mind to resist drugs' charms, and get easily addicted. It is NOT OK.<BR>

Nothing like being abused and forced to sit in ones own fecies for days at a time to get kids on the straight and narrow.

I for one am all for this type of treatment for drug users.  With all the problems with crime and violence related to drugs this is a menace.  Parents who do drugs often encourage their children to do the same.  For this reason all drug users should under go forced sterilization and re-education until they see the er of their ways.  No need to have breeding druggies to create more druggies.  Re-education camps are the only way to convince these abominable, cursed filth that they are not free to put what they want into their own bodies.  Afterall....this is the United States of America.  A proud and powerful nation that has laws against such frivolties as freedom to pursue happiness through the use of drugs.  Our founding fathers did not fight and die for this great nation to fall to drug use and terrorism funded by drugs.  We should put all free speechers, gun toters, smokers, SUV drivers, people who have sex with non-christians and geriatric sun bathers in prison for life.  Oh, and don't get me started on those clove smoking hippie college students.....It's a shame that our government provides federal student aid to kids who are just going to blow it all on drugs, alcohol and condoms anyway.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It's very obvious that there are many people here who are drug "newbies" and completely missed the point of the article, <b>satire</b>. 
<br>To those readers who are highly anti-drug, whether due to personal experience or U.S. gov't propaganda, I guess I can understand your objections to the article. I disagree with them, but we're all entitled to our opinions. Personally, I thought it was pretty funny, depicting the stereotypical image of an uninformed, uneducated parent who sees their teenage children growing up and being out of the house more and more, and they start to worry.
<br>To throw in my $0.02 about drugs, I really think that "soft" drugs like marijuana and its variants are really no different than alcohol and tobacco, and the current legal status of marijuana in North America is hypocritical. Marijuana opponents frequently use the term "gateway drug" as a discouragment to decriminalization, but what they don't mention is that users of hard drugs very frequently also used tobacco and alcohol prior to hard drugs, as well as marijuana. Again, I have to ask "Why is marijuana illegal when these other drugs aren't?"

This is in reply to your article "Exploding the myths of teenage drug use" <BR>
I find this article to be an extremely biased look at the whole topic.<BR>
Things like spying on your kids , eaves dropping and going through their <BR>
rooms , what ever happened to talking to your kids about the problem if <BR>
you are suspect of drug use.One thing I found extremely annoying is the<BR>
narrow-mindedness and biased opinion on music and drug use.I thought<BR>
you we're way out of line with your comment on drug users listening to...<BR>
"ambient", "electronic","hip-hop", "house", "rave" or "techno" as you put it.<BR>
Why don't you just put out a ban on all music! and everything else in life,<BR>
because by the sounds of things everything and drugs go hand in hand.<BR>
You can't tell me you don't listen to music , what you said is wrong and <BR>
maybe a little research will help too!<BR>
 <BR>
Aggravated <BR>
Awaiting your reply<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Nice, but seeing as I used to do all kinds of drugs and actually KNOW WHAT I'M ON ABOUT, here's a few revisions.<BR>
<BR>
Heroin can be smoked, injected or snorted.  Typically the terms "reefer", "joint", and "roach" are for marijuana (the mild psychadelic, cannibis sativa), not heroin.  Heroin typically costs $10-20 per hit, however can cost upwards of $100 to get a good fix if you're an addict.  Bongs are used for marijuana.  Usually, to smoke heroin, one dusts cannibis leavs with it to intensify the high. (for reference, as well, 100 pounds sterling is worth about $145, as of this morning)<BR>
<BR>
Crack is dealt in "rocks", not "cracks".  A crack rock is white, not brown, and, well, rock solid.  Chewing crack is not an option.  It is usually smoked through a glass tube ("crack pipe") containing a bit of steel wool (no soap.  that's just nasty, thanks.) to support the rock.  It is constantly burned as you inhale, using what is called a "crack torch", or a modified lighter that outputs the long, hot flame necessary to burn crack.  <BR>
<BR>
Crack's daddy form is "Coke" (cocaine), which is a white powder (many things are, you'll find), and is quite a bit less potent.<BR>
<BR>
Things to look for with heroin, crack or coke:  The obvious ones:  needles, a spoon with scorch marks on the bottom (due to the prep process with heroin), cut off straws, possibly with a melted end (for snorting), a glass tube with a smoky white film on the inside (crack pipe), bits of steel wool, or "chore boy" scrubbers, razor blades (for chopping up cocaine), an overly high set lighter (not a sure sign.  some kids are just pyros), mortar and pestle that's not used for cooking (better option for creating a smooth powder than using a razor blade.)<BR>
<BR>
Extacy is not methamphetamine or crank.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm not even to go into the indicators (they're quite wrong), but will write an article on my own and post it somewhere (thanks for the motivation).<BR>
