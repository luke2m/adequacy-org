		Ten years after the release of Nirvana's landmark album, <A
HREF="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=Arz6jtr59klox"><I>Nevermind</I></A>,
Kurt Cobain has been elevated to messianic status by an army of adoring
disciples. It is common for a cult-like following to develop around a
musician whose life is tragically foreshortened and Cobain is no
exception. While he was alive, Cobain's angst-laden soul-baring lyrics,
together with the uncompromising aural assault of his music, struck a
chord with the disaffected youth of Generation X and earned Nirvana
considerable critical and commercial success. Cobain's suicide was
interpreted by his followers as the ultimate statement to demonstrate the
integrity of his artistic vision and reinforced their belief that his
music truly came from the heart. In their eyes, Kurt Cobain was a
martyr.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">It is a common misconception that Nirvana were a band of reformed punks
who, despite their musical na&iuml;vet&eacute;, managed to achieve enormous success
through a combination of good fortune, hard work and singing from the
heart. It is understandable that Cobain's abilities as a musician and
songwriter are underestimated, for the wonderfully simple nature of
Nirvana's music belies his undoubtable genius. However, the truth is that 
Kurt, Krist and Dave were gifted with extraordinary talent.<P>
 
Nirvana's debut album, <I>Bleach</I>, showcased the first fruit of
Cobain's nascent genius. <I>Bleach</I> failed to set the world alight on
its release and Nirvana were unfortunately pigeonholed as just another
band attempting to rehash punk rock for a new generation. However, in
retrospect it is easy to see that Nirvana had a unique talent which set
them apart from their prosaic contemporaries. The stand out track of
<I>Bleach</I>, <I>About a Girl</I>, is a three-minute slice of pop
perfection, owing more to <I><A
HREF="http://www.thebeatles.com/html/daytripper">Day Tripper</A></I> than The Damned and more akin to <I><A
HREF="http://www.thebeatles.com/html/shelovesyou">She Loves You</A></I>
than The Sex Pistols. <I>About a Girl</I> can be viewed as a statement of
intent and the result of Cobain flexing his creative muscles in
preparation for forthcoming masterpieces.<P>
 
The precursor to Nirvana's ascent to musical greatness was the replacement
of original drummer Chad Channing with Dave Grohl. With hindsight, it is
obvious that Grohl was more than just the <A
HREF="http://www.nme.com/NME/External/Reviews/Reviews_Story/0,1069,3050,00.html">"Grunge
Ringo"</A>.  Grohl's debut album <I><A
HREF="http://www.foofighters.com">Foo Fighters</A></I>, released after
Cobain's death, demonstrated that Kurt was not the sole talent within
Nirvana. Not only did Grohl compose and sing every song on <I>Foo
Fighters</I>, but, barring a few cameo appearances, he played each and
every instrument on the album. By adding Grohl to the Nirvana line-up,
Cobain had finally assembled the roster of virtuoso musicians necessary to
implement his masterplan.<P>
 
Kurt Cobain's high standard of musicianship has been universally
overlooked by both music critics and other musicians. Being a guitar hero
is a highly competitive business and the worth of a guitarist is
ultimately judged upon his ability to play the greatest number of notes in
the shortest possible time, without regard for the aesthetics of the
resulting sound. By these bizarre criteria, guitarists such as <A
HREF="http://www.angelo.com">Michael Angelo</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.pd.net/yngwie">Yngwie Malmsteen</A> receive plaudits for
demonstrating little more than their manual dexterity, while the
achievements of truly innovative musicians like Kurt Cobain and <A
HREF="http://www.jimi-hendrix.com">Jimi Hendrix</A> are downplayed.
However, Cobain was undoubtedly one of the finest and most intelligent
guitarists of all time.<P>
 
While other rock guitarists sought to dumbfound their audience with
displays of superhuman technical ability, Cobain opted for melodies that
his fans could sing and play along with. In the same way that bands such
as the <A HREF="http://www.firstfoot.co.uk/Bad Scottish Pop/Bad Scottish
Pop/baycityrollers.htm">Bay City Rollers</A> developed an affinity with
their audience by choosing fashions that their teenage followers could
imitate, Cobain wrote guitar solos that his fans would wish to <A
HREF="http://www.olga.net">emulate</A>. Kurt Cobain understood his target
demographic and realised that Nirvana appealed to aspiring teenage
musicians. Accordingly, Cobain dispensed with the fretboard <A
HREF="http://bonefire.org/guy">pyrotechnics</A> advocated by <A
HREF="http://www.vai.com">Steve Vai</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.satriani.com">Joe Satriani</A>, instead choosing to play
brilliantly simple melodies that his fans could easily copy. Kurt Cobain's
sparing and calculated use of the guitar is at least partly responsible
for the popularity of Nirvana.<P>
 
With the release of <I>Nevermind</I> in September 1991, Cobain's plans
finally came to fruition. Although the overnight success of
<I>Nevermind</I> surprised the music industry, Cobain was well aware that
his creation would take the world by storm.  <I>Nevermind</I>'s famous
cover, featuring a baby swimming towards a dollar bill, is a clear sign
that Kurt intended <I>Nevermind</I> to achieve the mainstream appeal that
had previously eluded the band. While Nirvana's fans often claim that
Nirvana were the antithesis of corporate rock music, Cobain didn't share
his followers' disdain of the music industry and he hankered after commercial
success. In the song <I>In Bloom</I>, Kurt derides Nirvana's fans, the
same fans who so vigourously defend the band against claims of "selling
out", for their inability to comprehend the band's desire for mainstream
acceptance:<P>
 
<I>"He's the one who likes all our pretty songs<BR>
And he likes to sing along and he likes to shoot his gun<BR>
But he don't know what it means"</I><P>
 
The highlight of <I>Nevermind</I> is the anthemic <I>Smells Like Teen
Spirit</I>, a song that has become synonymous with the grunge movement.  
The origins of the instantly recognisable four chord riff that
characterises the song have been the subject of much debate. While most
Nirvana fans like to think that <I>Smells Like Teen Spirit</I> was heavily
influenced by the work of seminal alternative rockers The Pixies, the most
likely ancestor of this song is denied by the snobbish cognoscenti of
alternative music. Close listening to <I>Teen Spirit</I> reveals that the
song has <A
HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=style/sundayarts&contentId=A25214-2001Aug31">much
in common</A> with <I><A
HREF="http://orpheus.la.utk.edu/music/resources/song.site/ROCK.mre/ROCK.mre.html">More
Than A Feeling</A></I> by adult oriented rockers Boston. To use an old
clich&eacute;, "hacks copy, geniuses steal", and it is a measure of Cobain's
genius that Nirvana's breakthrough single bears such a resemblance to Boston's feelgood vibe and universal appeal. By evoking memories of
Boston's biggest hit, the success of <I>Smells Like Teen Spirit</I> and
<I>Nevermind</I> was assured.<P>
 
However, success proved to be a poisoned chalice for Cobain, who was
ill-prepared for the sudden adoration that was heaped upon Nirvana.  Like
many other bands, Kurt's reaction to his newfound popularity was to

release a challenging album that would alienate his fanbase. Nirvana's
third and final studio offering, <I>In Utero</I>, was an album of
sugar-coated angst which demonstrated Cobain at the height of his
songwriting ability. Despite being Cobain's most ambitious and coherent
work, <I>In Utero</I> was greeted by an unenthusiastic response from
critics and consumers alike, who were disappointed by the lack of moshpit
anthems. It is ironic that those fans who had initially praised Nirvana as
an alternative to bland commercial rock music turned their backs on the
band following the release of their most innovative and uncommercial album
to date.<P>
 
Tragically, on 5 April 1994 Kurt Cobain took his own life. Many Nirvana
fans saw Cobain's suicide as a validation of his music, a misconception
which was fueled by the <A
HREF="http://www.hotshotdigital.com/WellAlwaysRemember.2/KurtCobainNote.html">suicide</A>
<A
HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Venue/6582/Nirvana/suicidenote.html">note</A>.  
Cobain's followers have selfishly interpreted phrases such as <I>"The worst
crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and
pretending as if I'm having 100% fun"</I> to mean that the the suicide was
intended to preserve the integrity of Nirvana's supposed punk rock ethic
in the face of huge commercial success. It is more likely that Cobain's
unfortunate suicide was simply a cry for help rather than an attempt to
prove to his followers that he was "<A
HREF="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/rembrandt/441/4real.jpg">for
real</A>".<P>
 
It should now be clear that Nirvana's rise to fame was no accident,
with every aspect having been meticulously planned by Kurt Cobain. Perhaps
it is comforting to delude ourselves with the belief that Nirvana were
simply everyday guys who achieved greatness by accident, since this
fallacy allows us to dream that we too may experience success and
adoration despite our lack of God-given talent. However, it is a testament
to Cobain's artistic vision that he was able to
finely craft a band and musical style that the cynical Generation X youth
would take to their hearts. In this way, Nirvana were little different to
any number of faceless pop acts like The Spice Girls or The Backstreet
Boys, who were invented by marketing men to target a specific demographic.  
Nirvana produced some great music and left us with fond memories of their 
short career, but it is time that their fans accepted the truth: Nirvana 
were just another manufactured band.<P>

Listening to some of you snobs here who only listen to Classical music, I feel a bit sorry for you.  By limiting yourselves you miss out on some very fine music.  
<BR>

<BR>
I enjoy all kinds of music.  My favorite Classical composers are Beethoven and Stravinski, also Bartok and Berlioz.  I like Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and many other Jazz players.  
<BR>

<BR>
And I like Nirvana!  Of their contemporaries, Soundgarden impressed me the most, they were another fine band.  But Nirvana had the touch of genius that comes along once in a generation.  Rock is populist music, far different in scope and goals than Classical music, so comparing each of them as art forms is pointless.  
<BR>

<BR>
Whatever you like is cool, but dissing something because you don't understand it is, well, lame.  It's one thing to put down a synthetic, manufactured band like backstreet boyz or whatever, but Nirvana were much more.  
<BR>

<BR>
As to Cobain blatently ripping off other bands, all I can say is that in concert he was known to open Smell Like Teen Spirit with the Boston riff...Cobain himself claimed that the song was a ripoff.  Wracked by self-doubt, Cobain was incessantly unhappy with his music, but I think anyone familliar with the Nirvana catalog would agree that a great body of fiercly creative and original music exists because of Cobain.  RIP.

Yes, but it was a very precisely executed attempt at being "just another flavour-of-the-day 90's guitar band." Foo Fighters was a very good album, particularly considering that a) it was Grohl's first album b) he sang/played (virtually) everything c) he was previously a drummer. The songs on Foo Fighters are actually very good, I think the problem with the album is that it's overproduced and slightly <i>too</i> perfect.<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Or at least they would have if it weren't already in such a smelly hole by the late 80's. Though one can credit Cobain for turning the mainstream back towards guitar-based rock from 70s-80s synth-trash, the "alternative" angst-filled bullshit they tied to it has done nothing but create an endless train of faceless imitators. Cashing in on the teenage-boy demographic's new love for "raw intensity" and over-distorted guitars, mallternative band superstars like Corn and Limp Biscuit are manufactured just as readily as boy bands like In Synch. Alternative has become a buzzword, commandeered by the mainstream to make the same music seem different from the bubblegum pop targetted towards little girls and the old "rock" targetted towards adults.
<BR><BR>
Really, all the popular music categorizations have become bullshit since Nirvana's inception. "Alternative" Corn music sounds just like "Pop" Backstreet Boys dressed up in "heavy" distorted power chords and unintelligible screaming lyrics. Mainstream "hip-hop" uses the same formul�, dressed up in poorly-utilised samples and tacky bass-n-drums. There hasn't been a real revolution in popular music since the British Invasion of the 60's.
<BR><BR>The Beatles popularised rock'n'roll, and brought it influences from almost every conceivable source. The Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Who created the underpinnings of hard-rock and punk that would end up being so abused in the long run. After the 60's died with the creation of Led Zeppelin (the first popular band where commercial factors would overshadow artistic substance) and the perfection of analog synthesizers, pop lost its direction. The progressives like Yes and King Crimson tried to bring rock to the level of European art music, only to be shot down by the Sex Pistols. Glam stars like David Bowie, Kiss and Queen continued to put image ahead of substance in the minds of the public. Pink Floyd dumbed down art-rock for mass consumption, dressing their mediocre music up in technological gimmickry. The 80's saw the ultimate collapse of substance, as hair, new digital synths and the ever-increasing importance of the Commercial Image overshadowed the necessity for any novel musical ideas or interesting melodies, as long as it made good dance music.
<BR><BR>
This is the environment that allowed Nirvana to make their "breakthrough". With the record-buying public having forgotten what a guitar or a decent melody sound like, Cobain was free to steal some ideas from the Pixies and the other more interesting alternative bands of the day (back when alternative actually meant something), dress them up in arena-friendly idiot riffs, and shock the public with his "personal" angst-filled opera.
And I'm tired of hearing songs that all sound exactly the same on top 40 radio.<BR>---<br><i>A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace, and rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace</i><BR></FONT></td>

Courtney "Kurt's Yoko, Only Worse" Love. Courtney the despised.  Courtney Love, who singlehandedly brought the practice of couples naming their newborn daughters "Courtney" to a sudden and total halt.<BR><BR>And yet, in the end, <i>she won</i>.  The woman who made "Hole is a band" the most hated phrase since "Heil Hitler" became, not just a rock star, like her gifted and revered husband, but a full fledged celebrity phenomenon. The world wept with her at Kurt's funeral.  America rocked out to Live Through This, and the rock crits were barely done analyzing Courtney's lyrics before they were bowled over by the movie crits swoonin' over Courtney's performance in The People Versus Larry Flynt.  She has even, defying all possible odds, managed to <a href="http://www.lazybastard.com/kurtandc.htm">look really hot</a> (click link, then scroll down a bit) in a Versace photo shoot. Recently, Courtney bounced sproingingly back from the poor sales figures of Hole's third album by becoming a prominent voice in the Napster debates, and finally, taking on that grandest of Grande Dame roles, Celebrity Litigant.  All this in the face of the relentless disgust of the True Rock Fans of the world.<BR><BR>What, in comparison, does Cobain's legend have to offer?  "I'm talented!"  "I'm sad!"  "I'm dead!"

Fuck tragic beauty.  Courtney is a real American success story.  As self made as Ben Franklin, as Glittery as Marilyn Monroe, as Rebellious as Jim Morrison.

Let's see-  where was Negative Creep stolen from?  How about Polly?  Maybe you could point out the New Kids on the Block song that Lithium was stolen from?  How about the Bobby Brown inspired lovely tune Francis Farmer (etc)?
<BR>
Nirvana exploded out of Seattle at a time where the music industry was completely stagnant.  No bands were doing anything new in the world of popular music.  There was this huge thing happening, though, just below the surface.  Bands like Sonic Youth and the Jesus and Mary Chain were making the best music of their careers, and Nirvana was ready to take all that energy which was hidden from so many and channel it direcly to the more accessible areas which they hit.
<BR>

<BR>
I bought bleach on a whim on 12" vinyl from Sub Pop when it was released, and ever since, I have listened to almost everything possibly released by Nirvana.  There are moments of beauty and ugliness in almost every song- and the wierd thing is that no two of the songs feel the same.  THEY ALL HAVE FEELING THOUGH.  More than I can say for 9/10 of the rock crap out now.  Fred Durst has ruined rock and roll.  :)

Yes, I noticed this about nirvana.  I still listen to a few of the songs, and some of the ones I like the most are the ones that sound like they were made purposely harsh and ugly.  I don't even remember the names of most songs, but the one I can think of that is an example of this is "Drain You".  I'm not sure which album it's on, but reading your comment made me think of it.<BR><BR>

Anyway, I think the author of the main post has written an ending to his little rant that is contrary to the rest of it.  To briefly show you what I mean, the article went like this:  Kurt Cobain was very talented.  His music had an artistic side.  He planned the success for his band.  HE WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A CORPORATE POP STAR.  One of these lines does not belong (Hint: it should stand out.).<BR><BR>

It could be I'm swayed by the fact that I still have some respect for the band, which, at the time, wasn't just another damn grunge band.  They may not have been exactly the first, but they were the first good one (blah blah, subjective, I know).  There have been countless imitators who, let's face it, suck.  Just because you don't like a style of music or its usual implementation doesn't mean you have to hate everyone who makes/made that kind of music.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

My argument is consistent. The point I was trying to make is that Kurt had the ability as a musician and songwriter to create music that he knew was going to be successful. In the same way that countless pop acts are cynically manufactured by record companies to generate success among a certain demographic, Cobain created a band that would appeal to an angsty teenage male audience. It is to his credit that he was able to write music that achieved his goals. But, just like the faceless teen bands, Kurt's music was superficial since it was carefully crafted to provide his audience with what they wanted to hear and he was no more "for real" than Britney Spears or her contemporaries.

Only yesterday I attended a fine performance of Wagner's <i>Die Meistersinger</i>, a further reminder (as if I did not receive one each day!) of how far music has fallen from its former glory. The stridently dissonant "atonal" music of Schoenberg and Stravinsky and the dreary and forgettable "pop" music of Nirvana are two sides of the same coin--music that degrades rather than uplifts the soul, music that reflects a decadent, immature shallow culture.

Why, I think you are right. But I did. And if you thought it through, you would agree with me.

<BR><BR>Can Stockhausen compare with Beethoven? Berio with Schubert? Miles Davis with Bruckner? Kid 606 with Bach?

<BR><BR>Perhaps you wish to avoid such comparisons. Perhaps you feel nothing meaningful can be gained from a comparison of, say, modern electronic doodlings to Mozart. Yet we are comfortable mentioning Beethoven and Bach in the same sentence. During his lifetime, Wagner and Brahms had acolytes who recognized their music as being of exceptional quality from a historical perspective. Other great composers received similar recognition, at times postumously, but with few exceptions within a reasonable time frame. Yet what "modern" composer, "pop" or "classical," could suffer comparison to the giants of Western music? I <i>dare</i> you to name names.

<BR><BR>No, music as Art has hit rock bottom. Our culture is a mirror held to our times--and as we see in modern literature, painting, sculpture, and music, our times are not up to the task of creating true Art.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Some people think of contemporary as last year and others take it to mean the whole of the 20th century. You can look at the whole of the 20th century classical music oeuvre and find some works that are right up there with the best of all time. But comparing, say, Stravinsky with Bach and Schoenberg with Wagner is kind of a pointless exercise, since without the earlier composers the later ones could not have done what they did. It's like saying your grandfather is a better person than you are because he came first.
<BR>

<BR>
And, incidentally, IMHO there are parts of Wagnerian opera that really drag. You can actually sit and listen to some 20th century composers, but trying to listen and follow along with Das Rheingold had me yawning in 10 minutes. Of course, it's meant to be watched live, which is another story.

Indeed; as I have <i>repeatedly</i> argued, the art of our age has not come close to matching the art of earlier times. I have yet to see any statement on your part that seriously challenges this point.

<BR><BR>If serialism of Boulez (for example) represents a new frontier rather than a dead end, why have most modern composers abandoned it? (I am aware it is possible to have a very passionate debate about the merits or errors of serialism and atonality; I am not attempting to start one, simply stating the fact that the influence of Boulez at this point in time is not very significant.)

<BR><BR>I agree that most composers of the past were mediocre. I have never argued otherwise, and for you to assert that I have demonstrates your characteristic intellectual dishonesty. 

<BR><BR>Again, I challenge you to state which relatively recent works of art you feel are of comparable merit to the great masterworks of the past. 

<BR><BR>If you feel that a comparison of composers of the past to those of the present is meaningless, why did they seem so much more reasonable to (for example) Hans von Bulow? Or even to Nadia Boulanger, who confidently placed Stravinsky and Schoenberg, along with the usual three, as the greatest composers of Western art music? Why can't we be similarly sanguine about "Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Berio, Boulez?" Or "Stockhausen, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach?" Has the nature of music changed so much? Or is it simply that no contemporary is worthy of such company?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway.  I consider Stockhausen's <i>Kontakte</i> and <i>Gesang der Junglige</i> to be some of the greatest music, ever, superior to eg. the early Mozart quartets (everything prior to K. 387,) and some of J. S. Bach's more workmanlike cantatas.  I don't think that Stockhausen is a first-rate master, but his best works are better than the lesser works of greater masters.  I think that Schoenberg's Pierrot, Verklaerte Nacht, the Book of the Hanging Garden, and Suite op. 23 are immortal masterpieces fully equivalent to (although totally different from) major Beethoven works like the middle-period piano sonatas.  I think that Berg's and Bartok's violin concertos are some of the supreme examples of the genre, and that Berg's <i>Wozzeck</i> is one of the greatest operas of all time.  Happy now?<BR><BR>In a way, this is comparing apples to nails.  I had no desire whatsoever to post this disgusting list of comparisons.  As God is my witness, I was pushed to the friggin' wall.<BR><BR>This ridiculous tonal-music chauvinism of yours shows you in a very poor light.
