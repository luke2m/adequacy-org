<p>Speculation is rampant as to the identity of the parties responsible for the destruction of the World Trade Center and the attack on the Pentagon.

<p>We are a lawful nation.  No matter how horrific the crime, those accused are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  This crime is no exception.
<p>We must determine the individuals responsible and bring them to trial.  This is our national duty and one that we must give our full support.  But we must not attempt to settle this issue through military strikes alone.  If we believe that the culprits are being sheltered by a foreign power, then we may have no choice but to retrieve them through a military intervention.  But our goal as Americans must be to make them answer for their crimes in a court of law.
<p>Respect for the rights of the accused and the rule of law is what makes this country great.  If we give into our natural desire for revenge and execute those believed responsible without a trial; what are we then?  In taking possibly innocent life, we will be no better than those we attack.
<p>The highest calling of a patriot is not to defend his country, but rather to make his country worth defending.  I hope that I can depend upon my fellow Americans to fulfill this calling.  This is a time when we must stand tall.  This is a time for patriots.      <br><br></div>

And the sanctions on Iraq? The bombing of civilian areas of Cambodia? The overthrow of the democratic government of Chile? The twenty years of support for Indonesia while it massacred the population of East Timor? The support and training for death squads in Columbia? The repeated vetoing of UN resolutions condemning Israel over a whole host of issues, including posession of nuclear arms? The sanctions on Cuba? The ten-year terrorist war against Nicaragua?

The sanctions are primarily American and British backed and implemented, but I suppose I can give you this one. There still remains the unilateral bombing of Iraq by the US and UK.

<blockquote><i>The repeated vetoing of UN resolutions condemning Israel over a whole host of issues, including posession of nuclear arms?</i> Maybe the resolutions themselves were sheer idiocy. You question the sanctions on Iraq; the same set of minds brought you those too.</blockquote>

Well, maybe. On the other hand when a nation vetos <i>every single</i> resolution critical of its main strategic ally, it starts to look like they're not just doing it in order to protect the UN from bad resolutions. It starts to look like they're protecting a state built on torture, murder, and the theft of land from the scrutiny of the international community.

<blockquote>If Cuba were serious about wanting the United States as a partner in trade, it probably wouldn't have accepted Soviet medium-range nuclear missiles to ornament their island.</blockquote>

IIRC the current government of Cuba was initially quite keen to trade with the US (as it had done before Batista's overthrow) but they were rebuffed. Faced with a choice of allying themselves with the USSR or facing total economic collapse, they (quite reasonably) chose the former.

<BR><BR>You chose the easy ones to defend. Defend the bombing of Cambodia - then I'll be impressed.

<BR><BR>At the time when the Cubans imported Soviet IRBMs to missile bases a hundred miles from the borders of the U.S.A., the U.S.A. had had for years nuclear-armed Jupiter IRBMs stationed in Turkey, which was <i>zero</i> miles away - it shared a border - from the Soviet Union.  The flight time of these intermediate-range nuclear missiles - the "early-warning" period - from liftoff in Turkey to atomic detonation over Moscow would have been less than ten minutes.  

<BR><BR>With regard to threats of nuclear terror, the U.S.A. was consistently recklessly aggressive against the Soviet Union.  Are you unaware that through the fifties, the U.S.A. and its allies flew nuclear-capable bombers over Russian cities on a regular basis?  As unbelievable as that assertion may seem to you, I extracted it from is the book <i>Dark Sun</i> by Richard Rhodes; you may argue with his well-documented sources if you like.

<BR><BR>The fact is that, despite outright fictions like Kennedy's "missile gap" and Reagan's "window of opportunity," at no time during the Cold War, ever, did the Soviet Union ever present half so imposing a nuclear threat against the U.S.A. as the U.S.A. imposed upon the Soviet Union.  As we had started it, the Soviets were entirely justified to counter our IRBM threat with their own.  And in fact, after the Cuban Missile Crisis, while the Russians took their missiles back from Cuba, the U.S.A. also quietly withdrew its arsenal of IRBMs from that threatening forward position in Turkey.  Thus Khrushchev's Cuban IRBM deployment eventually had the net <i>positive</i> effect of easing the prior hair-trigger <i>status quo</i>.

<b>How many more deaths will it take to prove what the lives lost were worth?</b><BR><BR>
There is a world of difference between retaliation and justice. I have little doubt that retaliation and additional loss of life will occur; I have reservations as to whether or not justice will truly be served in the process. This saddens me greatly.<BR><BR>
With regard to the consequences of these attacks, I offer the following for consideration. Loss of innocence is the most striking casualty, regardless of the actual, final body count. The realization that horrifying events such as those witnessed live on CNN today can happen here, on "mainland" U.S. soil, is now a part of our national consciousness. The technology we rely upon on a daily basis for benign purposes has been successfully reinvented as devastating weaponry. How we deal with this loss of innocence, however, is what I believe to be of the greatest importance in the present moment. The psychological ramifications of today's events will likely be years in the making; our cultural landscape will be undeniably altered.<BR><BR>
I am a resident of Seattle. A little less than two years ago, residents of this city were subjected to the declaration of martial law in response to the WTO riots -- the most outrageous of many civil rights violations committed during that incident which remain unrecognized and unaddressed to this day.  While I am uncertain as to how we will respond to the hijackings and horrifying, senseless attacks perpetrated today, I have little doubt that the civil rights of our nation's average citizenry will be impacted.  A handful of self-proclaimed Gap-wearing anarchists and opportunistic looters turned Seattle into a military-occupied war zone in November of 1999; I cannot imagine what will come to pass as a result of today's tragedies. I hope that the decisions that are made for the purpose of ostensibly protecting our country are sensible ones; I fear, however, that instead we will lose something precious in the balance, that the freedoms we have long celebrated will be inexorably altered. In the wake of today's events, this is what I fear the most.<BR><BR>
With this in mind, my "patriotic response" to today's tragedy will focus on ensuring that our rights as individual citizens of this country are not sacrificed unreasonably in future efforts to thwart terrorism.  There will always be those who are willing to die for their beliefs, whether or not what they believe is actually true or the actions they choose to take in support of those beliefs are laudable; I have little confidence that this can be changed in a manner which serves justice instead of simply adding to the body count.  Instead, I choose to work to prevent the "little deaths" in my day-to-day existence that can be avoided with careful and conscious thought, particularly those impacting the civil rights we all share as Americans.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

</i>
<BR><BR>
I have to question why you are making a point of something no one has contested. I also question why that same insight has eluded America during its long history of  terrorism against South and Central America. I think America has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0853459916/qid=1000304476/sr=2-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/103-2702356-7248619">frankly benefitted from terrorism</a>; and if that is the case, then America should relinquish its monopoly on terrorism so that all nations may profit by it. Since that isnt a satisfactory position, we should admit  chasing blame and pursuing sanctimony offers    little prospect for iterative progress.
<BR><BR>
<i>This is an irrational evil act. </i>
<BR><BR>
Which nevertheless accomplished two things.  First,   it  was a convincing demonstration of American vulnerability.  I imagine this is important to a Palestinian wavering his or her     resolve against a powerful, crushing  enemy.  I suspect this is the reason for the cathartic displays of joy broadcast from the Middle East; I certainly dont think anyone wasnt  horrified at the certain knowledge of *personal* tragedy.
<BR><BR> 
Second, one hopes this demonstration of vulnerability  shattered American innocence. 
If Americans understand that they arent above the fray,  maybe they will become critical of their current government's arrogant abrogation of international commitments such as Kyto, and isolationist policies towards the Middle East.  You cannot just pump money into Israel and walk away from the festering, violent mess such finance creates.
<BR><BR>
Third, is terrorism *necessarily* an irrational evil? 
I think radical American Revolutionary militias such as the Mass. Minutemen and Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys were  irrationally evil considering the relatively minor threat posed to English, wealthy Colonials by England.  I think they make latter day terrorist organizations such as Hamas  look saintly by comparison.  
It becomes even harder to  penetrate the fog of irrational evil when  one remembers  Hamas was originally financed by Israel and Bin Laden by the US; both were once presumably  more useful than evil.
There seems to be a fine line between hyperactive justice and terrorism, made that much finer by America's <a href="http://www.deoxy.org/wc/wc-index.htm">blunt dismissal for the conclusions of  international jurisprudence</a>. 
<BR><BR>

You'd think differently if you'd had to walk out of your office into a cloud of tear gas; if you'd had to present proof of your place of employment to enter certain blocks of the city where you live, work and pay taxes; or if you'd been arrested for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.<BR><BR>

I believe that it's high time for the United States' rubber-stamp policy of hegemony to come to an end.  Not familiar with the word?  Its definition is as follows:  "Preponderant influence or authority over others:  DOMINATION" (source:  www.merriam-webster.com).  I believe that its time we learn, as a nation, to lead by <i>example</i>; if nothing else, the doctrine we endorse will be more credible.  Once we address the injustices and inequities within our own borders, we can then begin to address <i>focusing on the rights of individuals outside our [sic] borders</i>; to do otherwise is hypocritical.<BR><BR>
I know that I, as an individual, have little influence over national policy.  I choose, instead, to act within my own community to ensure that the values of our nation are enjoyed to the fullest extent by all, regardless of race, creed, color, ethnic origin, religion, gender or sexual preference.  This is how I choose to exercise my patriotism.<BR><BR>

There's a difference between being asked to present id, long dead Americans, and living 12 year old wage slaves eking out a living in the shadow of  America's transnational corporate darlings. There's a difference between living in America and living in country under a crushing debt which can only be serviced by growing cash crops. There's a difference between developing native productive capacity and American landlords exporting away all your production. There's a difference between sewing clothes for pennies a day and buying them cheaper than web pages. There's a difference between bottled designer water and a poisoned water supply.

I don't recall ever having addressed the subject of preventing terrorism; perhaps you've confused me with someone else?

� If the United States couldn't get it together to pass our own Equal Rights Amendment, how could our nation stepping into the ring to support the "Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women" be interpreted as being credible?<BR><BR>

I don't recall ever having addressed the subject of preventing terrorism; 
</i>
<BR><BR>
No, you addressed the subject of protecting Americans from the effects of terrorism.  Is the connection between the effects of terrorism and terrorism itself tenuous? 
Why is your country the victim of terrorism to begin with? I think that point deserved its own mention and  ...
<BR><BR>
<i>
perhaps you've confused me with someone else?
</i>
<BR><BR>
... if I wanted to mention the point to you, directly,  I would have   used email instead of adequacy.  But there are  quite a few people who read adequacy, and as long as I dont misinterpret your remarks, there isnt any obligation for me to reply strictly according to the way you wish your remarks framed. 
Your message was not misinterpreted, it was complemented.
<BR><BR>
<i> Will focusing on the rights of individuals outside your borders also protect us from future home-grown Timothy McVeigh clones?</i>
<BR><BR>
Yes, McVeigh received his epiphany in Iraq.  The Internation War Crimes Tribunal judged the US guilty of
"engag[ing] in a pattern of conduct beginning in or before 1989 intended to lead Iraq into provocations justifying U.S. military action against Iraq and permanent U.S. military domination of the Gulf", and found Bush guilty of having
"intended and acted to prevent any interference with his plan to destroy Iraq economically and militarily."  So it all ties in with my original reply, doesnt it? If you want your rights protected from anti-terrorist measures at home, it would make sense if you stopped abusing people's rights abroad. Instead of shrilly defending against the effects of terrorism,  stop provoking it.
<BR><BR>
<i>
Keep your condolences, sweetie. You need 'em more than I do.

I'm sure, but  what do I need them for? So far you know exactly one thing -- I'm not patriotic.
