From that fat smelly guy who lives in the server room at your workplace to your neighbor's fifteen year old son in his "<a href="http://home.freeuk.com/individual73/103.html">Limp-Bizkit</a>" T-shirt, Linux Zealots come in all shapes and sizes, but two things remain constant.<p>
1) The personal hygeine problems<p>
2) The inability to concieve of any valid viewpoint other than their own. <p>
In this article I will penetrate the very psyche of the alternative OS zealot. Distasteful as that might sound, I will be probing the inner mind of the <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Linux Zealot</a> attempting  to shed some light on what drives these <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/graphics/esr001.jpg">social</a> <a href="http://www.april.org/actions/rms/20061999/photos/picture-015.html">misfits</a>.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">You may have heard about <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Linux</a> - a <a href="http://www.opencountry.org/hobbyist.html">hobbyist</a> operating system based on the <a href="http://www.sharewarejunkies.com">shareware</a> principle, has been making waves in the <a href="http://www.2600.org">hacker underground</a> and in the periphery of <a href="http://www.ibmandtheholocaust.com">large corporations</a> for around five years now. Linux is a competent operating system which can even be said to compete with professionally designed OS's such as <a href="http://www.wxperience.com/art_extern.php?url=http://msn.zdnet.com/msn/zdnet/story/0,12461,2810235-hud00025hm3,00.html">Microsoft Windows XP</a>. Nothing remarkable there, after all the market place for other goods has <a href="http://www.sportscarsrus.biz/the_figaro.html">many</a> <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/html/vanquish.html">examples</a> of <a href="http://www.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010330.htm">competing products</a> which are <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/01_30/b3742119.htm">all but identical</a> to the casual observer.<p>
What many people do not realise is that to <a href="http://www.softpanorama.org/OSS/bad_linux_advocacy_faq.shtml">some of its advocates</a>, Linux is <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/apA.html">more than a simple tool to get a job done</a>. To these <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/guns/rig.html">extremists</a>, Linux represents a <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue37/pennington.html">philosophical</a> almost <a href="http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/features/linux/feature010723.asp">religious belief system</a> - a way of life based around "<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">open source</a>" and "<a href="http://www.opensource.org">free software</a>".<p>
You may have encountered one of these <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/30/19898.html">Linux evangelists</a> at work. They make themeselves known by constantly <a href="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~baitoven/hatems">berating Microsoft products</a>, and blindly praising Linux. Their belief in the power of Linux is akin to the Muslim's belief in Allah. In fact, <a href="http://66.96.205.195/~azzam">fundamentalist Islam</a> and hardcore Linux zealotry are two sides of the same coin. Press a Muslim as to why he or she is a Muslim, and they will suggest you <a href="http://www.hamoislam.com/quraan.htm">read the Qu'raan</a>. Ask a Linux apologist why Linux is better than the alternatives and the explanation you are most likely to hear is "<a href="http://www.progsoc.uts.edu.au/~baitoven/hatems">Linux Rocks - Micro$oft Sucks</a>"<p>
The Linux Zealot typically displays an <a href="http://masaka.cs.ohiou.edu/~eblanton/advocacy.html">irrational hatred of Microsoft</a>, a complete conviction that his choice of operating system is the only valid one, and a scathing patronising contempt of anyone "stupid" enough to use "windoze"*.
<p>What causes this mindless OS bigotry? you may be wondering. Well, the <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/science/freud/Biography.html">father of modern psychoanalysis</a> - Professor <a href="http://freud.t0.or.at/freud/index-e.htm">Sigmund Freud</a> proposed an idea which he called the "<a href="http://web.utk.edu/~burstein/musings/svhepap.htm">narcissism of minor
differences</a>". Put simply it means that people hate other people who are very similar to them.  This similarity threatens their sense of individuality, their sense of self, causing them to react in a hostile manner, which seems to become more hostile, the closer the similarity.<p>

We can see this effect in conflicts all aroung the world. From the (white, Christian) Catholics and Protestants in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,479825,00.html">war-torn Northern Ireland</a>, to the (white, Christian) Serbs and Croats in the former Yugoslavia, to the (Monotheistic) Muslims and Jews, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/geneticbrothers000509.html">semite brothers in hatred</a>.
<p>
In the same way that Arabs and Jews differ very little in genetic make-up and yet almost every single one of them hates the other with a passion, Windows and Linux have very much in common and yet their supporters fight tooth-and-nail over which one is "best".<p>
<p>
No doubt a <a href="http://www.crescentlife.com/articles/toward_islamic_psychology.htm">qualified</a> <a href="http://www.complementaryhealthe.com/spiritual_h.html">psychologist</a> or <a href="http://members.ozemail.com.au/~fangora/doctors.html">doctor</a> could come up with all
kinds of <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/qg_ss.html">elaborate theories</a> as to why the Linux Zealot behaves the way he
does. One theory I have is that the Linux Zealots have <a
href="http://www.konformist.com/2000/donkey-dick-not.htm">small penises</a>
and <a href="http://www.themodernreligion.com/ugly/ugly_ego.htm">belittling others</a> for their choice of operating system is their way of
'getting back' at <a href="http://www.dollynet.freeserve.co.uk/thatcher.htm">society</a> and the world for their <a href="http://www.andrologysociety.com/handbook/ch13.cfm">unfortnate genetic inheritance</a>. <p>
Another possibility is that due to the aforementioned hygiene problems the typical Linux Zealot <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0963582607/adequacy-20">cannot get laid</a>, and <a href="http://www.hypnosense.com/Sublimation.htm">subliminates his frustrated sexual energy</a> into <a href="http://boudicca.tux.org/mhonarc/ma-linux/2000/2000-May/msg00579.html">blaming Microsoft</a> for <a href="http://www.portalofevil.com">all the evils of the world</a>.
<p>But I expect you have heard enough of my <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/ro/sfr/jerry.html">amateur psychology</a>, I am interested in what you, the <a href="../index.html">adequacy</a> readers think. Why do these Linux advocates get so riled up about something so utterly insignificant as choice of OS ? Surely they cannot <i>all</i> be <a href="http://www.truthbeknown.com/mental.htm">mentally ill</a> ? (however intuitively obvious that answer might be)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I started sniffing Linux crack in May of 2000. Back then, I was still using a misconfigured version of Microsoft's Windows 95, and I thought it was Microsoft's fault - silly me. <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/">PC World's</a> May 2000 issue just arrived, with a special article on Linux - and GNOME looked <b>COOL</b>! Linux has got to be better than Microsoft!
<br>
<br>
Now, I would have dismissed it as a passing phase - but I then went to work at a company that was practically nothing but Linux zealots. My fellow co-workers were waging a holy war over which distribution I should have chosen - and I eventually went with the hippiest distro of them all - <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>. Now I was skipping the crack and going straight for the opium injection - my OS preference manifested itself on my family's home computer, my computer, and I constantly preached the benefits of Linux.
<br>
<br>
About eight months later, my patience was wearing thin with this so-called 'OS'. The constant <a href="http://www.newsforge.com">elitism</a>, coupled with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">complete</a> <a href="http://www.kde.org">lack</a> <a href="http://www.icewm.org">of</a> a <a href="http://www.sawfish.org">standard desktop environment</a> was troubling. Indeed, the nutball <a href="http://www.stallman.org">RMS</a> "forgiving" KDE users of their sins should have given me a clue that I was using a OS made by <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org">crackheads</a>
<br>
<br>
I tried to dismiss it all, but Linux's inferiority proved itself further when a certain de Icaza decided to replace a stable, perfectly working file manager for GNOME with a <a href="http://www.eazel.com">slow, bloated monstrosity</a> Thankfully, Eazel died out before they could do further damage.
<br>
<br>
It became clear that Linux was not the OS for me after a certain Lunis Torvaltyos decided to replace a perfectly working VM subsystem with a half-finished, bug-ridden incomplete one - <i>in the 2.4 tree</i>
<br>
<br>
I am still recovering. I installed Microsoft's Windows XP and was relieved by how easy it is to update drivers, and the standard GUI interface, and its broad support for software - <a href="http://www.lokigames.com">and games</a>

Linux is a competent operating system which can even be said to compete with professionally designed OS's such as Microsoft Windows XP.</b>

<BR><BR>Linux is a kernel.  CObined with various other utilities, programs, etc, it becomes an OS, a firewall, etc.  It is <i>not</i> based on <i>any</i> principles of shareware.  Shareware is limited either by the number of times you can run it, functionality, or date.  Then you <i>must</i> pay for it to continue to use it fully.  It is also <i>not</i> based on freeware, as freeware does not include the source code nor is it available.

<BR><BR>I am glad however, that you did point out that linux is utilized by professionals, as well as hackers.  However, you fail to clarify which definition of hacker you are referring to.  Do you mean hacker as in developers which develope then share the wealth (either freely or commercially through licensing) or the popular definition butchered daily by the mass media?

<BR><BR>Linux does not compete with WindowsXP.  I agree with Red Hat's CEO that Linux is <i>not</i> ready for the desktop nor should developers concentrate their efforts on making it a desktop OS.  Well, at least not as their main objective.  Linux based OSes are, for the most part, meant for the server room.  There is <i>no</i> WindowsXP Server.  The next Microsoft Server OS is called <i>Server</i><b>.NET</b>.

<BR><BR><b>What many people do not realise is that to some of its advocates, Linux is more than a simple tool to get a job done. To these extremists, Linux represents a philosophical almost religious belief system - a way of life based around "open source" and "free software".</b>

<BR><BR>I agree.  There are Linux supporter out there that are just wacko.  The same can be said of those who will blindly follow Microsoft to the ends of the earth.  "Microsoft has never done anything bad.  Those court cases where MS was found guilty of blatant theft are blown way out of proportion."  Just look out how many people claim adequacy.org runs IIS on Windows when anyone with half a brain can prove otherwise.  People often think Bill Gates is a tech genious because he wrote BASIC.  What has he done since?  He is a marketing genious you uses every dirty trick in the book to get what he wants. 

<BR><BR><b>Ask a Linux apologist why Linux is better than the alternatives and the explanation you are most likely to hear is "Linux Rocks - Micro$oft Sucks"</b>

<BR><BR>Ask a Windows luser why the don't like linux and you'll get a similar answer.  "Linux sucks because it sucks and that's why it sucks"  Or they may say because they read some informative article (that was picked apart for containing opinion based writings on information the was factually inaccurate).

<BR><BR><b>The Linux Zealot typically displays an irrational hatred of Microsoft, a complete conviction that his choice of operating system is the only valid one, and a scathing patronising contempt of anyone "stupid" enough to use "windoze"*.</b>

<BR><BR>You don't have to be a Linux Zealot or Linux supporter to feel that way about Microsoft.  I fealt that way before Linux was even conceived.  Of course I have been around since the early days of Microsoft and know all about the many <i>many</i> court case it lost.  Of course usually through interpretation, loopholes, or funny language MS continued with their everyday practices.

<BR><BR><b>Another possibility is that due to the aforementioned hygiene problems the typical Linux Zealot cannot get laid, and subliminates his frustrated sexual energy into blaming Microsoft for all the evils of the world.</b>

<BR><BR>That's their problem.  But I don't think that's why they blame Microsoft.  Any zealot could come to where I live (in a nice area) or any city like it and get laid.  Of course the most all <i>nice</i> areas are usualy populated by rednecks selling meth like they do near where I live.  Of course the Windows luser who sits around on his $3000 computer he bought downloading porn all day can probably get laid too.

<BR><BR><b>But I expect you have heard enough of my amateur psychology, I am interested in what you, the adequacy readers think. Why do these Linux advocates get so riled up about something so utterly insignificant as choice of OS ? Surely they cannot all be mentally ill ? (however intuitively obvious that answer might be)</b>

<BR><BR>At least it's better than the half-assed attempts by elenchos.  But you still must examine both sides which you fail to do.

<BR><BR><b>Windoze, Micro$oft, Microshaft, Winblows, etc are all terms used by Linux Zealots. If you recieve an e-mail containing any of these terms, you can be sure you have a Zealot on your hands.</b>

<BR><BR>I use these terms to make jokes about things Ms has never fixed.  I also write the little story called "The Adventures of Windoze Luser" which was a creation by NAWL and sent to me to post on my website (which was just space I had for sgining up for a free "check anywhere" email address.  It's in reference to the Windows/Micrsoft Zealots.  I don't use the terms blindly.  For example I may refer to &lt;insert security hole here&gt; that hasn't been fixed by Ms in years.  Instead they piss and moan that people releaser the information about it publicly.  You see even with MS if you bring a security hole or exploit to their attention you cannot post anything about it for two weeks (does not include OSS).  MS still bitches about it.  Remember the exploit in UPnP?  The company that dicovered it gave MS <b>TWO MONTHS</b>.  Even then MS bitched that they went public warning people about it.  It was <i>then</i> that MS got off their collective asses and did something about it.

<blockquote>FINAL THOUGHT</blockquote>

Your article is very one sided.  It discusses extremists of various beliefs and at time delves into your one stereotypical mindset and bigotry.  There are Linux Zealots, Windows Zealots (Windoze lusers), and Mac Zealots (Mac Addicts).  There are those of us who support one over the other and will only challenge you if you spread lies about one or the other or lump us all into one group or the other.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Nope.  For many years the term hacker was used to identify the person who developed and innovated.  For many years the US government supported hackers.  It was hackers that are responsible for the technologies of the Internet.  Sure you may say this is old and this is outdated by it worked for so many years.  If it ain't broke why fix it.  No one dreamed of the innovations of today 30-40 years ago.  Should we look for something newer?  Yes.  Will it be accepted?  Maybe.

<BR><BR>Why should we change?  It's not our fault the media fucked it up.  Sure it takes, in many cases, an experienced hacker (or admin who understand security) to become a cracker.  Just like a locksmith could use his skills to break into people houses and rob them blind.  If an organisations of criminals came out calling themselves locksmiths would you tell locksmith to change their name?  People often associate blacks/African Americans with criminals.  Should <i>they</i> stop calling themselves black/African American?

<BR><BR>When I say media, I more blame movies than I do news.  People associate hacker with people that break into security systems, and write super viruses.

<BR><BR>I suggest that you read <b><a href="http://www.oldskool.org/personal/computer_movies_suck.shtml">this</a></b> essay.  Here's a snipet:

<blockquote><i>Computer movies suck. 

<BR><BR>Not like I needed to tell you that or anything, but it's true. In an era where PCs are a household appliance, video game consoles sell like hotcakes, and everyone's grandma knows what the Internet is, why does Hollywood insist on making incredibly stupid computer-based movies that insult your intelligence? 

<BR><BR>I don't know. Nobody knows. Only screenwriters or Hollywood suits can tell you. Some of the errors are negligible, like referring to websites that don't exist ("Deep Impact"); other errors are intentional fantasy that are appropriate to the story's vision, and are thus forgivable ("Tron"). But most of them are terribly, terribly wrong--a blatant slap in the face for those who work to improve the public's perception of computers. It's frustrating, it's degrading, and worst of all, it's just plain ignorant. Technophiles can't stand ignorance. (Which should be an indicator to all you Microsofties that you shouldn't call yourselves technophiles.)</i></blockquote>

More?

<blockquote><i>Want an example of good computer fiction? War Games. Yes, the entire second half of the film was silly, but the first half of the film where Matthew Broderick's character computes was very realistic. You can see a real CPM machine, real 8" floppy disks (remember those? Yes, they did exist), a 300 baud acoustic coupling modem (the kind you had to shove your phone handset into), and a character-based serial terminal. And the most realistic thing in that movie was how Matthew's character stole passwords from the school secretary's desk drawer. That is how it happens in real life, not through some super-hacker-password-cracker program. It's possible that a lot of the realism in War Games had to do with the fact that nobody knew enough about computers yet to make it inaccurate. Now every screenwriter thinks he's a geek. Feh.</i></blockquote>

<BR><BR>Did you even bother to read the essay?  You don't have to be a hacker to know that computer movies suck.  Of course you probably don't know shit anyway and probably believe all that crap.

<b>Of course they did. *rolls eyes*</b>

<BR><BR>Obviously you have never heard of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), NASA, or the National Science Foundation (NSF).  All of these were started by President Eisenhower.

<blockquote>A key appointment at ARPA came in 1962 when psychologist J.C.R. Licklider was hired to head a behavior sciences office, an office that would evolve under Licklider's two-year directorship into the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) which would direct the original creation of the Internet. Licklider in 1960 has written a manifesto for using computers to enhance research and research collaboration called "Man-Computer Symbiosis" and would define the IPTO's office's mandate in research funding. As importantly, Licklider's university background encouraged him and his successors to extend ARPA's funding to a range of university projects.

<BR><BR>One key project was a $3 million per year grant to Project MAC at MIT to encourage the spread of time-sharing computing on the then-breakthrough minicomputer technology. ARPA would fund six of the first twelve time-sharing computer systems in the country, which in turn would help spark the whole minicomputer industry in the 1960s--crucial in the industry and the Boston-area regional economy then but as crucial to the development of the Internet over the next decades. Out of Project MAC would largely develop the early ethos of software and hardware innovation--"hacking" in its early non-pejorative sense before it became confused with electronic vandalism--that launched the computer revolution. It was MIT hackers at Project MAC who largely designed both hardware and software for DEC's breakthrough PDP-6 timesharing minicomputer. They would spend endless hours creating and sharing new software to extend its capabilities beyond the expectations of its creators.</blockquote>

<BR><BR>Isn't it amazing how the government will <i>still</i> not grant any contracts unless the organisation has a Unix offering?

<BR><BR>You can read the entire white paper <a href="http://www.netaction.org/opensrc/future/"><b>here</b></a>.  Either that or you can read about the contributions made by Douglas Englebart, Tim Berners-Lee, J.C.R. Licklider, and many more when it's published this Fall by Penn State Press.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You missed it the first time. Here it is again. "Hacker flics would suck 100 times worse if they accurately depicted the Nawls of this world and their boring obsession with obsolescent computer minutiae." Get it? They dont make movies to entertain people whose idea of a good time is theming gnome or futzing with $PS1. Why do you resent movie-going lusers having an innocent good time  at your marginal expense? 
<BR><BR>
<i>I also noticed that you dropped the other parts of your argument. </i>
<BR><BR>
You think you're participating in an argument between earnest peers honesting defending their intellectual position, do you? 
It makes you feel all smart inside to remain incorrigibly obtuse, doesnt it? 
I bet you also think you're registering an argument by blurting out "that's unpossible!" in a darkened theatre or by loudly embarrassing your date with speculation such as "that effect looks like it was rendered on Lunix! We're not leaving till the last credit has rolled."

You may have a point. After all, most hacker lunatix share his inability to resist a tone of misplaced condescension while tirelessly defending their faith with pedantic corrections to irrelevant and intentionally misdirecting minutiae. In fact, if you hadnt protested your ignorance so strongly, I might have lingering doubts as to your identity.

<BR>

<BR>
Guess what.  Linux is a faster system.  It is.  I've USED it to do the same tasks in less time than in Windows.  Not that Win doesn't have its merits.
<BR>

<BR>
For example, in linux you can do things faster -- if you already know how to do it in the first place.  Yeah, my apache server will outperform your IIS server, but chances are your IIS took five minutes to set up while my inexperience with Apache made it take about 2 days.  
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is NOT easy to use, nor should it be; if my Apache server took five minutes to set up, I probably wouldn't have come across all the things I could do to make it more secure, either.  Your IIS server is still looking like you just installed it -- and you wonder why you just got hit with a massive DoS.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is for servers and geeks.  If you're basically an intellectual masochist, as are most good technologists, Linux is your way to go.
<BR>

<BR>
What breeds Zealots?  The hours and hours they spent learning how to use Linux.  To them, it IS easy to use, and if you haven't the patience to sit there and learn yourself, you're obviously inferior in the attention span department.
<BR>

<BR>
You'll find the same thing in the music world.  You'll find many, many people who play metal guitar (Windows user analogue), then you'll find the classical pianists (Linux 0wn3r analogue) who can't stand the metalheads.
<BR>

<BR>
It's a matter of the skillful having no respect for those who can't be bothered.
<BR>

<BR>
You want my stance?  I love Linux, but the truth is I couldn't see using it for anything where I have to interact with it for an extended period of time.  Win2k makes life easy.  
<BR>

<BR>
I don't support Microsoft; yeah, I paid for Win2k.  But I use StarOffice rather than MS Office.  I close their pop-ups.  I hack Win2k's resources to remove their logos and disclaimers.  I get around the installer licences by hard-removing them prior to installaion.
<BR>

<BR>
You think that's illegal?  What, I don't distribute the modified software, and I do this before accepting the liscence.  The agreement there is what makes software modification a breach of contract.
<BR>

<BR>
I use Win2k, but I will not allow ANY software to have more control over my computer than I do.

<BR><BR>Linux <i>is</i> ready for the desktop.  However, as someone pointed out before, it's not yet ready for everyone.  I would say it's more for those that can navigate KDE, GNOME or whatever with little to no trouble.  It's not for people that whine and bitch when moving between MacOS and Windows.

<BR><BR>I hear it all the time.  "I don't like MacOS because I can't find this and that."  Or maybe "Windows is very rigid and requires too much setup, configuration, and way too many reboots".  With only a little bit of time, someone not expecting it too be exactly like the other can pick things up rather easily.

<BR><BR>This is a typical argument that I hear about Linux as well.  People often like to ramble on about the command prompt forgetting that many of the tools are available with a graphical interface.  They then say that KDE, GNOME or what not are copies of Windows, blah blah blah.  Hello!?!  Look at history.  Who's copying who?  The first Apple Lisa and Macintosh computers or the Xerox Alto.  Hell a few developers like Douglas Englebart developed a rather nice (though simplified) GUI in the <i>way</i> before anyone.

<BR><BR>So who is copying who?  People like to site the Taskbar as a prime example.  Microsoft?  Nope.  Remember OS/2 Warp?  Remember how MS delayed the release of Windows95?  OS/2 was released before Win95 and had a WarpCenter (Taskbar) and LaunchPad (the dock: MacOS) and even had virtual desktops (a current Linux feature).  In many ways it was superior to Windows.  Microsoft can claim innovation because no one really remembers past OSes (especially younger users).  Innovation my ass.  OS/2 also had the Object Desktop Control Center.  Also these elements in similar form are in GUIs available for unix-variants, but only one or two for Windows.  Most are hidden away or not available without third party software in Windows.  Linux developers has never really claimed innovation as far as look and some of the feel.  It's more about familiarity.

There's rather a lot more to Linux than navigating the desktop.  Grandma had better take a crash course in using Google Groups to seek answers to the inevitable problems as she embarks on a journey of several years' frustration and destruction of data. 
<BR>

<BR>
Just coming to terms with what LILO and GRUB do to her MBR will be a fairly steep learning curve.
<BR>

<BR>
She had better be prepared to spend in the order of up to a week to install apps, hunting down the dependencies all over the net and even then perhaps not getting something to run that literally would take one minute to install in Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
Of course she can compile all her apps herself (!) but she'd better be patient because only one in five attempts will succeed.  She will certainly broaden her horizons as she attempts to decode error messages such as "no iso.c in /etc/bin/lib/penguin kernel module fstab".
<BR>

<BR>
If she can capture video from her DV camera via her Firewire card I will walk backwards to Finland and buy Linus Torvalds a beer.
<BR>

<BR>
I suppose for graphics work she'll use Gimp.  I really doubt she'll live long enough to figure out that byzantine, crash-prone monstrosity.
<BR>

<BR>
I could go on.

When trying to use Linux, the desktop is the least of one's worries.

<BR><BR>Why does granny have to worry about the Master Boot Record?  Maybe she wants to get rid of Linux and install Windows.  If she wants to install NT, 2000, or XP then there's no need to worry.  These OS installation wipe and overwrite the MBR anyway.  This is one of the reason you install Linux <i>after</i> Windows when dual booting.

<BR><BR>Maybe she wants to install Windows 98.  Granny will likely never do this and will call you no matter what OS she wants to install.  Just use the Linux installation CD and use the DOS utilities to remove the linux partitions.  You can also use a universal PC bootdisk (I recommend also having DELPART from bootdisk.com on it as well).  Since 9x, and Me don't overwrite the MBR or include partitioning tools you have to do it manually.  Want to clear the Master Boot Record?  By using the bootdisk or Linux installation CD you bought or burned yourself just type <b>FDISK/MBR</b>.  You seem just as dumb as granny if you don't know that.

<BR><BR><b>She had better be prepared to spend in the order of up to a week to install apps, hunting down the dependencies all over the net and even then perhaps not getting something to run that literally would take one minute to install in Windows.</b>

<BR><BR>Things don't always install in one minute using Windows.  And I hope she's prepared to download any bug fixes or registry updates after installing crappy drivers that came with the device.  Also why are you hunting anything down?  Ever wonder why Debian users love <code>apt-get</code>?

<BR><BR><b>Of course she can compile all her apps herself (!) but she'd better be patient because only one in five attempts will succeed.</b>

<BR><BR>Unless she planning on doing some major configuration she should never have to compile anything.  Most apps install easily with their own installers.  Why does everyone <i>still</i> think you need to compile and recompile everything?  Hell buy her a Mac with OSX installed.  She can watch the kernel compile itself.

<BR><BR><b>If she can capture video from her DV camera via her Firewire card I will walk backwards to Finland and buy Linus Torvalds a beer.</b>

<BR><BR>First off Linus Torvalds lives in California.  He lives there and works at Transmeta Corp.  Second I don't know why everyone is confined to Linux.  I prefer the TRUE Plug and Play with the Mac as opposed to Plug and Pray with Windows.  When people speak of granny using a computer they are often referring to the lowest denominator of PC users (sorry grandma).  I don't know too many grannies that have digital camcorders.  I only know a few that have scanners.

<BR><BR><b>I suppose for graphics work she'll use Gimp. I really doubt she'll live long enough to figure out that byzantine, crash-prone monstrosity.</b>

<BR><BR>Well if she like paying for software (as should would have to with most MS apps) she can opt for something else.  She could also search the Internet for some other free offering or use another program that came free with the distro.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Agree. If someone will not get the Bright Idea&trade; and will not want to continually send them Excel spreadshits and Word documents and other things in proprietary (*spit*) formats with intentional incompatiBILLities...
<BR><BR>
If the granny-in-question gets adventurous and tends to mess with the system and take it down, it's not a problem to back up Linux (or BSD, or any other known-to-me unixoid/POSIXoid) configuration files and libraries. In case of a network you can even have a disk image with a fresh installation and reinstallation of everything requires just booting from a floppy (or even a bootROM) and overwriting the disk. Try this with Windows and they will most likely scream bloody murder and then freeze. Ever tried to recover Wind0ze from a bad case of registritis, without wanting to babysit it for a day and reinstalling and reconfiguring?
<BR><BR>
In long term, Linux is much better manageable than Windows. Not so crash-prone, crash-recovery is easier, and there is no registry rot. (And no DLL hell, though /lib sometimes reminds it. And you can solve most of things remotely over ssh without having to go on-site: Grandma, put the red floppy to the drive and reboot the machine, and grandma does so and I then dial in to the offending machine, mount /dev/hda1..., and find what's wrong.)
<BR><BR>
When you have "blank" users, not locked in one kind of user interface yet, pick for them the one that will be the easiest for you to maintain and keep running. They are Users, they aren't techies, they will be unable to reinstall Windows if it'd save their life. (They may be lured to attempt to - then they will call you in anyway.)

A nice trick I use to repair Winblows98 whenever it craps out is SYSTEM.1ST (pronounced system first).  Restart in MSDOS mode if you can at least get to Windows or select to boot to a command prompt (shut up elenchos).  Then remove the attributes of the c:\windows\system.dat file and c:\system.1st file (hopefully you have it).  Copy system.1st over system.dat (copy system.1st system.dat)  It takes Windows back to 10 minutes before it finished installing.  All your data is safe.  When prompted for the Windows disk just click DETAILS and point it to the target location.  The necessary files are STILL there (if you still can't find a file then insert the disc).

Then all you have to do is install all your drivers and download any patches and security updates (this is the longest part of the whole deal).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Which is not to say that MSFT has always attained this goal: the MSFT OS legacy ranges from rousing successes like Windows 9x to miserable failures like BOB and Windows ME, but the point is the company keeps trying.<BR><BR>Compare this with the outlook of the average Linux zealot, who sits mandarin-like and contemptuous of  "lusers" who, imagine that, prefer using a GUI to the flexibility (once you've taken the time to memorize hundreds of commands and options) of a CLI. A simple stroll through usenet will reveal hundreds of stories being swapped by sneering Linux fanatics about clueless newbies who *gasp!* might need a little hand-holding while figuring out how to configure .bashrc, or who -get this!- were somehow not born with the knowledge of how to unpack archives and install software from source.  This distaste for  the Linux-ignorant masses, who just might have other things to do besides spend hours fiddling with computers, is the reason behind the notoriously bad quality of pretty much all Linux documentation.<BR><BR>The upshot of this is that the hatred that  the average Linux zealot shows toward Microsoft's efforts to make their software accomodating to individuals of all skill levels fits in with the other traits common to Linux fanatics: the Japanese Cartoons, the Sci-Fi, the nerf guns, the "alternative" music, the piercings and dyed hair and in-your-face attitude, and above all the disgust with "marketroids" and "PHB"s and anyone else who has to compromise a little, play politics, kiss some ass, or fudge the facts to get by in this unforgiving world.  The outlook of the Linux Zealot is the outlook of the arrested adolcescent, the Holden Caulfield who fancies himself the last bastion of purity and righteousness against a billion phonies and prostitutes.  And we all know what happens to Holden Caulfield.  Oh wait, I forgot, Linux fanatics don't read anything besides fantasy novels and Neal Stepehenson: Holden Caulfield ends up in a looney bin, so grab a clue, squirts.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Which version of Windows 2000 are you referring to?  Professional, Server, Advanced Server, Datacenter?  I have seen them all crash or lock up even after a clean installation.  Hell most lockups are <i>during</i>the installation.  Afterwards I find Windows does not always discover components correctly.

<BR><BR><b>But, even as I know that Linux majority are unwashed, unshaven hendonistis manchildren, is it really our job to tell them that?</b>

<BR><BR>First off:

<blockquote><i>Your article is very one sided. It discusses extremists of various beliefs and at time delves into your one stereotypical mindset and bigotry. There are Linux Zealots, Windows Zealots (Windoze lusers), and Mac Zealots (Mac Addicts).

Coming in here and starting patheitc name calling is rediculous.  I suppose that you would lump big name corporations into that category.  You have noticed companies like IBM have started very large add campaigns for Linux haven't you?

<BR><BR><b>Don't flame me or anything, I shave daily, I wear excuslivly dress shirts and listen to Wagner opera.</b>

<BR><BR>I shave daily, and trim my gotee on a regular basis.  My hair is long but very well kept.  Regularly it's cut by a barber (hair dresses are for women).  At work it's always kept in a pony tail with a little gel to keep it neat and tidy.  Afterwork, I may lose the pony tail or not.  It depends on whether I going out to a nice place with my girlfriend or hanging out at a bar listening to a live band.  That's right I listen to a wide range of music.  I listen to almost anything with an open mind, except country and teenie booper crap.

<BR><BR><b>I disagree with the comment about Japanese cartoons. I know most are crap, but some are pretty good, hehehe.</b>

<BR><BR>True.  I prefer Manga myself.  It's more adult (grown up).  No wide eyed, tear drop bullshit.  The last one I watched was Ninja Scroll.  Not bad.  Although I do occasionally watch Pokemon with the younger kids when I visit my family.  I thinks it's good to spend time with them so they can hopefully grow up and lead productive lives, whether it be a blue collar or white collar (or one of the in between) job.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Either there isn't much of a difference anymore, or this zealot's puss-sacs are coming to a head, causing him to write the best unintentional humor since my family's last circle-jerk. Let's get started:<BR><BR>

<i>You have noticed companies like IBM have started very large add campaigns for Linux haven't you?</i><BR><BR>
I also remember hearing something about IBM and the holocaust. Also, it seems that you Lunix zealots have a tough time deciding how to (group)think about corporations: surely a corporate entity as big as IBM can't be good, can it?<BR><BR>

Decisions, decisions. I knew a couple of guys who looked just like you in high school. Notice the emphasis I added to point out your lunacy. And no, you are not getting your lunch money back.<BR><BR>

<i>...hanging out at a bar listening to a live band. That's right I listen to a wide range of music. I listen to almost anything with an open mind, except country and teenie booper crap. 
</i><BR><BR>
Yeah, bar bands do play a wide variety of music. All the way from Blink 182 to Matchbox 20. Also, I like how it sounds since you took out the apostrophe. Very agro. Maybe you should chill with that Nitzer Ebb shit before you gun down your co-workers.<BR><BR>
<i>Although I do occasionally watch Pokemon with the younger kids when I visit my family. I thinks it's good to spend time with them so they can hopefully grow up and lead productive lives</i><BR><BR>
Nothing like a little Pokemon to shorten the attention span and melt the brain. You might as well put some uncut doses in their swimming trunks and throw them in the pool.<BR><BR><BR>----------------<br>"Feel me when I bring it!" --Gay Jamie<BR></FONT></td>

This means that modern Jews are in fact closer in cultural and genetic ties to Ghengis Khan's Golden Horde than to the twelve tribes of Israel.

<BR><BR>

The reason for this is that the Khazar Kagante was the only state before Israel that had Judaism as an official state religion. This is also the reason why such a huge number of Jews have Polish or Russian ancestry -- before the Russian Revolution, the Russian Empire had a Jewish population of about 2 million people. (!!)

i.e. It is definitely known that the Khazar Kaganate did indeed exist, that it definitely had Judaism as a state religion, and that it was destroyed by the Russian kingdom around 1000 A.D.

Almost nothing about the genetic and cultural makeup of the Khazar people is known. We can make some very wild guesses, though.

From my context, though, the Kazaria legend makes sense -- in Eastern Europe, "the Jews" are a secular non-semitic nationality. At one time there were up to a million non-Jewish "Jews" over here; most were killed during WWII, and those that didn't have since mostly emigrated to Israel.

<BR><BR>

P.S. From my understanding, there is quite a bit of culture clash in Israel between regular Jews and Jews from Eastern Europe; I don't have first-hand experience, though, so correct me if I'm wrong.

<BR>

<BR>
Linux IS NOT shareware. IT IS freeware. And even more: IT IS open source.
<BR>

<BR>
You may thought that it's shareware since most of the Linux that you can grab is SOLD in something called a DISTRO. But ALL those distro producers MUST HAVE it for free and download in their site.
<BR>

<BR>
IT IS more than freeware because you MUST HAVE the code so you can change and improve your Linux system.
<BR>

<BR>
The freeware concept doesn't comtemplates distribution of source code. You can use for free but you cannot change it. So if it as a BUG you are stuck with it.
<BR>

<BR>
Well! I hope that this simple concepts passthru your mind and that you never call Linux shareware or freeware anymore. It demonstrates that you don't know what are you talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way... most of the BIG Linux companies are now owned by stincky people I can assure you.
<BR>

<BR>
See: www.suse.de www.redhat.com www.ibm.com www.oracle.com www.conectiva.com www.mandrake.com and see who are their shareholder partners.

<BR><BR>There's nothing in the GPL which states that you must provide your distro through download.  Take Yellow Dog.  You can only get ahold of it by purchasing the distro.  With it comes the source code.  The source code is free but Yellow Dog can charge for the media (CD) it's on.  Most companies make it available for download but with no documentation or support.  Support services must be purchase separately if you choose this method.  If you purchase a retail copy limited support is offered.  You can purchase additional support if you like.

<BR><BR>This is actually not that different that Microsoft.  Microsoft includes documentation in the OS just like with Linux and man pages.  However, consumer get no direct support from Microsoft and must rely on the manufacturer they bought the computer from.
