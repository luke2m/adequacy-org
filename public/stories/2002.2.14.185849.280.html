		Recently, a series of events transpired in my life that awakened me to a growing menace online.  I have discovered that the drug subculture has found its way onto the Internet.  That's right, your AOL or Internet account is a gateway into a thriving black market of marihuana, pills, Ecstasy, and even harder drugs.  Although it's still difficult to talk about, I'd like to share the experience with you.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I recently installed Internet monitoring software on my home computer, as various authorities recommend if your children use the Internet.  I felt it my duty to make sure my kids were not spending their time online looking at porn, hate sites, and the other hazards online.  I expected I'd catch them taking surreptitious looks at Playboy or other sites, and be able to discipline them as was appropriate.  I was unprepared for what I found.
<p>
My older son, Lance, who just turned 16, had spent the majority of his time looking at various technology-oriented websites and sites that catered to teenagers.  Within the past few weeks, I noticed he was frequenting sites with strange names, often having the words "smoke" or "bud" or "slash" in the web address.  When I looked at the sites he visited, I was astonished to find they dealt almost exclusively with drugs and drug paraphernalia.  There was an astonishing amount of information and drug advocacy at these sites, and even links to foreign sites where various drugs and paraphernalia could be ordered and (wonder of wonders) shipped to any address in the world!  I resolved not to confront my son directly with this information, but to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he was only displaying the curiosity about drugs many children have at his age.  It was a horrible mistake.
<p>
I discovered a charge on my credit card to some entity named "Paypal."  I investigated the charges, and found my son had used my credit card to cash advance $120 to a company in Holland via this Paypal service that had a web storefront for selling drug paraphernalia.  This company specialized in equipment for smoking marihuana, and also sold seeds that could be germinated.  The seed selection in particular fascinated me; I found myself wondering at the bizarre names the various strains of marihuana had.  There was "AK47," "Purple Haze," "White Widow," and even "Bubblegum!" The site described the types of "highs" the various varieties imparted, using terms like "Kind, mellow high" and "One-hit wonder."  I was terrified that a player in the illegal black market for drugs was able to set up a storefront on the Web as legitimate-looking as any other, using a sales pitch designed specifically to ensnare children into trying drugs.
<p>
I took the evidence I had and went to my son's room.  I saw him through new eyes, and noticed he exhibited the lethargy and puffy eyes that the habitual marihuana abuser develops.  I demanded he tell me how he got the drugs, how long he had been addicted, and how the Internet was involved.  At first he tried to deny everything, but confronted with the web usage logs I had printed out and the credit card statement, he realized the game was up and told me how he had been lead down this evil path.
<p>
It started with a "community-oriented" tech site.  The site apparently has a "comments" section where users can make comments about various stories.  My son told me he had followed a URL from the site, where he came upon a marihuana-advocacy site that extolled the benefits of marihuana.  At school the next day, he showed the site to some of his friends, who said it was "cool."  They told him about a "chat room" on AOL where he could chat live with marihuana users and even (they had heard) buy marihuana online.  Wanting to bolster his "cool" status with his friend, he went to the site and was "messaged" by a man who offered to sell him "an ounce of skunk" for $50.  My son had stolen $40 from my wallet and used $10 of his lunch money to buy the marihuana.  The man even gave him a small metal pipe for the purpose of smoking marihuana for no extra charge.
<p>
My son had smoked this "skunk" with his friends, and gave some away to them.  My son gave me their names, and I made a note to speak with their parents, and apologize on behalf of my boy.  My son had gone back online to find the man who sold him the marihuana, but couldn't find him.  The people in the chat room told him of other services, called MIRC and ICQ, and gave him the aliases that drug dealers used online, the code words to use if you wanted to buy marihuana, and the "chat rooms" accessible via ICQ and MIRC where drug dealers waited to make deals.
<p>
I had taken copious notes as my son was talking, and I gave him a spanking with my belt and told him I'd investigate this myself.  I went into the den and logged on to the computer with my son's account and password.  As I logged on, the ICQ software popped up and notified me of new messages.  To my horror, the first was some sort of advertisement for a cr�me that would increase penis size. I knew this ICQ was bad news, and read through the messages.  The first looked like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
To: xxxx<br>
From: xxxx<br>
----<br>
hey dude I can hook yu up with a bag of mex for $20 it is all I got now. If you want X I gto I can get u some call mypager at xxx-xxx-xxxx
</blockquote>
<p>
I was trembling with shock, but I managed to hit the print button to save this evidence for the authorities.  The next was even more troubling:
<p>
<blockquote>
To: xxxx<br>
From: xxxx<br>
----<br>
idont have smoke anymore if u want the kind msg xxxxxxxxx if u need x or crank msg me agin 
bob
</blockquote>
<p>
I couldn't believe that in response to a child's request for marihuana, which is terrible enough, this lowlife was offering "x" and "crank" to my son instead!  I understood better why marihuana is known to be a "gateway drug," it's because the pushers who peddle marihuana want you to become comfortable with illegal drugs and move on to harder and more expensive substances to abuse.
<p>
There were several more like that, but it was all I could do not to call the FBI the instant I finished reading the last:
<p>
<blockquote>
To: xxxx<br>
From: xxxx<br>
----<br>
You sound like a wonderful young man.  I live in the same town as you, on xxxx Avenue.  I can give you lots of weed and you don't even have to give me money.  I collect clothing, and I can give you a joint for each pair of underpants that you've worn that you want to give me.  You could even make some money if you would do other things for me. I'll give you whatever you want and nobody has to know. ICQ me back and I'll give you my address.
</blockquote>
<p>
I was enraged that this drug pusher was also a child molester. When I was able to think more calmly, I realized that any degenerate sick enough to push drugs on little kids was probably not too far away from molesting them, and I was glad that I'd been given the opportunity to nip this situation in the bud.  I was happy too that I had evidence I could give to the police so they could investigate the sexual predator living on xxxx Avenue, and forbid my children from going near that neighborhood.
<p>
Something told me that this was not the end of it, nor even the worst of it, and I looked on my computer's desktop to find this "MIRC."  It took me some time to find it as it was in a hidden folder, only accessible from the "start" button.  When I launched the application, a window popped up with some arcane information about something called "DALNet" and various numbers and codenames.  I did see that my son used the online alias "MistaPhatBudz."  With some trepidation, I clicked the "connect" button and waited as the application connected to the MIRC service.
<p>
In a few minutes, two windows opened, one with a channel called "smoke" with a bunch of random numbers after it, and other called "d33lz." Both showed a "topic" which made no particular sense (one was "&lt;@JJZ&gt; I took the red pill! | * hardt0k3z doesn't mind anal sex" the other "&lt;badaZZ&gt; J00 R F4GZ! thx").  I noticed a flurry of activity in the "smoke" window as soon as it opened.
<p>
<blockquote>
[boxi_baked] PhatBudz!!! <br>
[riz_] MPB! <br>
[boxi_baked] W00T! <br>
[jakk0] what up, dog? <br>
[riz_] ! <br>
[riz_] Gimmie some that love! <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
I didn't type anything, and a few minutes later a "query" window popped up with a message from "jakk0." I decided I'd talk with the person sending the message and find out if this was another drug pusher.
<p>
<blockquote>
[jakk0] what's up<br>
[MistaPhatBudz] Nothing.  What is up with you? <br>
[jakk0] ...<br>
[jakk0] Whatever I'm going to be in xxxx next week, if you want a qp let me know where you want to pick it up<br>
[MistaPhatBudz] What is a "qp?" <br>
[jakk0] don't fuck with me<br>
[jakk0] I'm not in the mood for bullshit<br>
[jakk0] If you want a qp, tell me where to meet you, I'll be in town on Friday night<br>
[MistaPhatBudz] I would like the qp delivered to 16 Main Street<br>
[jakk0] What the fuck is 16 main street? <br>
[jakk0] The mall? <br>
[MistaPhatBudz] I will be at 16 Main Street, just let me know what kind of car you will be driving so I can meet you there. <br>
[jakk0] WTF? <br>
[jakk0] You fucking faggot, that's the police station<br>
[jakk0] I don't have time for this shit<br>
* jakk0 has exited (Fuck you MistaFagBudz) <br>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was surprised that this drug pusher didn't fall for my clever plot to have him drive up to the police station with a car loaded with marihuana and God only knows what else.  "Jakk0" must have alerted his friends that something was amiss, because the "MIRC" application suddenly generated an error message and locked up the computer.  However, I had had enough of the criminal black market underbelly of the Internet and shut off my computer disgusted.
<p>
I spent more time the next day reviewing the marihuana advocacy websites and drug paraphernalia for sale on the Internet.  I compiled a complete listing that I intend to turn over to the FBI so they can prosecute these websites in Europe for selling drugs to teenagers, and I gathered all the information I could about the vile human filth that tried to sell their poison to my son via ICQ and America Online.
<p>
If you have children, please, install Internet monitoring software before it's too late.  There is a huge subculture of marihuana pushers, trying to addict your sons and daughters to that terrible and dangerous drug, hoping to lure them into degenerate sex and harder drugs.  If you find your son or daughter looking at drug advocacy websites, or spending too much time on ICQ or MIRC, intervene before it's too late, and find out what they're doing.  If they're already addicted to marihuana, force them to help you track down the pushers selling them the drugs online so you can notify the police and FBI to bring them to justice.  The outside world is already rife with drug pushers and sexual predators, but at least you can help make your children safer from the online world.

But seriously, up until the first third of the 20th century, all drugs (even the so-called "hard drugs") were legal. You could buy cocaine in any apothecary, for no more than a bottle of cough syrup would cost you. Heroin, ether and morphine were also extremely common. At the time (I'm talking roughly the 1910's, though your mileage may vary) a cocaine addiction was a cheaper habit than a beer or wine addiction.

<BR><BR>

What's more, many of the classical artists, writers, musicians and political figures were heavily addicted to hard drugs; at the time, there was not so much social stigma associated with it, so many details are now lost. (Freud, for example, was said to have been heavily into morphine and hoeroin.)

Either way, Freud was apparently one of cocaine's earliest and most outspoken advocates.

Nothing inflames teen rebellion more than a panicing parent!  If you are at all anxious about confronting your teen, ask your family psychiatrist to prescribe a small quantity of alprazolam, valium, or other anti-anxiety medication.
<BR><BR>
Another factor that can interfere with your communication with your teen is lack of sleep.  If you find that over-the-counter sleep aids do not address the problem adequately, speak to your physician about stronger alternatives.
<BR><BR>
Let us not forget that breaking your teen of a drug habit can take a great deal of time, and a great toll on your psyche as well.  If you find yourself worn down by the battle against your teenager's drug habit, do not hesitate to ask your therapist about Wellbutrin, Prozac, Xoloft, tricyclics, or other antidepressants.
<BR><BR>
The battle against your teenager's drug problem is tough, but you do not have to fight it without assistance.  If you use all the tools at your disposal, you are much more likely to succeed.  Good luck!<BR><BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
I am sure that you would much rather debate the meaning of the word <i>drug</i> than state your position on legal and illegal drug use.  I'm sure you would be even happier to debate the meaning of the word <i>homonym</i>.  
<BR><BR>
I don't give a damn about whether or not you think a particular word is a homonym, or what you think <i>homonym</i> means.  I'm here to advocate the supervised use of legal medication in the fight against the abuse of harmful illegal drugs.  If you want to bitch about the English language or the definition of some word or other, then go write a whiny diary entry about it.
<BR><BR>
Argument over the meaning of a word, especially when it is deployed as a tactic whereby one might dodge out of a larger debate, is so common, particularly with tkatchev, that it deserves a name.  From here on, I will refer to any word that takes on a new or different meaning in the middle of a debate, at the whim or convenience of one of the participants, as a <b>tkatchonym</b>.
<BR><BR>
Now stop fucking around with your tkatchonyms and take a stand on the issue of drug use, little boy.  I'm ready when you are.<BR><BR><BR>

Xanax, for example, is not medication. Any sane person realizes this simple fact of life; trying to redefine the word "drug" is stupid and pointless, since you are not fooling anyone.

If, on the other hand, you want to argue for using medication to help combat drug abuse, that's also fine; it's a pretty stupid idea, though, since no such medicine has been invented to date.

Please stop the madness; I don't want to argue with you about word definitions. Since I (and any other normal person) already know the difference between drugs and medicine, you won't get anywhere with your liberalist sophistry.

Actually, I agree; the problem is, as always, in market control. The people who manufacture and distribute stuff like Xanax are closely connected with government structures. 



<BR><BR>



Moreover, manufacturers of Xanax are based in America and funded with American inverstors.



The manufacturers of cocaine are based in Columbia and are funded by the Columbian drug cartel.



<BR><BR>



Sadly, this is simply a matter of politics.

<BR><BR>

P.S. No, that does <b>not</b> mean that I think that pot should be legal; rather, I believe that Xanax should be illegal.

Xanax is an anti-anxiety drug, and a very addictive one at that.  The last time I checked hallucinations are not exactly conducive to calming anxiety.

<BR>

<BR>
Cannabis is somewhat less harmful than the vast majority of other illegal drugs. I think that use of heroin, crack, cocaine and the countless "rave" drugs (which can be made from just about any toxic substances found around the house) are a much bigger problem than casual cannabis use. The London pilot scheme gives officers more time to focus on more serious crimes and abuse of harder, more dangerous drugs. And it seems to be working.
<BR>

<BR>
That's why I occasionally smoke cannabis, and don't touch anything harder. I've never heard of a person dying of a cannabis overdose.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Then again, I'm not a stoner. I don't smoke weed as a habit. It's a very occasional thing. I buy at most 1/8th of an ounce every 2 or 3 months - and that's not a lot. That's if I bother to buy any at all, of course.
<BR>

<BR>
I do know a few people who smoke regularly though, and though their motivation seems to be somewhat subdued, they're just as smart and knowledgeable as anyone else I know.
<BR>

I still think it's more significant that more thefts are reported to have been committed by heroin/cocaine addicts feeding a habit than by stoners or any other weed smokers though.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I salute you for keeping an eye on your kids habits. As much as some people may advocate freedom and privacy, etc. A teenager must be monitored before disaster strikes. Teenagers are more capable of being self-destructive than just about any age group.

I am a college student, and am about to graduate (this summer). I have smoked marijuana for the better part of my college life. Not until last semester, did I quit. It is NOT physically addictive. The problem is the psychological impact it has on you. Oh, and even that, is really easy to overcome. The biggest and most difficult problem is the people and associations.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't have anything against marijuana, and I don't believe that it is the 'gateway' to harder drugs. I never touched anything hard, and all I used to say was "if it ain't green and sticky, I don't want it." People knew what I would say before even trying to offer me anything. Of course, I wasn't 16 and would like to think that I made more informed and educated decisions.
<BR>

<BR>
I quit because, well.. I stopped getting high anymore, and the quality we got here was getting worse and worse... or my tolerance got higher and higher. Either way, it wasn't worth the money and the time. But, I'm in school, I'm graduating, I have friends who graduated, etc. 
<BR>

<BR>
All I'm saying is, it's not the end of the world. You shouldn't be outraged at your kid. I would be outraged at the person trying to sell your kid hard drugs. That is indeed a problem. But, smoking some bud.. come on. I have been in this country for almost 5 years now, and I hardly know any American who hasn't smoked marijuana, in high school or in college.

<BR>

<BR>
The "information" given in them was very inflammatory, the image of Linux users presented was, for the most part, extremely negative and completely unrepresentative of what the culture is like.
<BR>

<BR>
For example: Linux Zealot goes to the movies. The LZ was painted as someone who believes that because something was created with free software, then it must naturally follow that whatever that creation is should be free or less expensive too.
<BR>

<BR>
True, there may be people who think like that, but they don't see the bigger picture. I know that making a movie or large software suite involves a lot of man hours, large monetary investment and other costs. So do most Linux hackers (that's hacker in the historically correct sense, not hacker in the perjorative, media-misled sense).
<BR>

<BR>
Then there's the image given that all Linux users are troglodyte creatures, dwelling in a basement totally ignoring the outside world. That's not true either - it's just that users tend to be extremely interested in what they're doing, they enjoy playing with computers and not so much involving themselves in other activities. It doesn't mean that these people deliberately ignore anything else, they're just doing what they enjoy, much like a football player or musician.
<BR>

<BR>
Those posts definitely were trolls - the author has a prejudiced, twisted view of Linux users, and tried to paint them in the worst possible fashion, which I'm sure the author knew would inevitably attract copious flames (and they did).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I read this article wondering whether it was real. Is it? It certainly seems so.
<br><br>
Let me preface this post by saying I have done just about every drug that is available today, with the exception of Crack, if you can think of it, I've done it. I did drugs heavily for about 7 - 8 years starting at age 17. I dropped out of high school at age 16, even before I ever had even known a person who did drugs. I even went to jail 3 or 4 times, but was never in any trouble related to drugs.
<br><br>
I am now 26 and am a computer programmer making $60,000/ year (more than the author I'd wager), previously to moving into the computer field I had been moving my way up in management at a large video game company. While at that company I did drugs heavily, and I was still management material. Now that you know who I am, I'll continue.
<br><br>
It's obvious the author is new to the internet, and does not remember the heyday of the alt.drugs.* groups. Drugs have always been a part of the internet culture, as much as every other thing us humans like to do. The internet is just a reflection of who we are, and what we do. Drugs have not suddenly moved into the internet culture, it's _you_ that have finally tapped into the internet cultere, which really isn't anything other than a reflection of the people you live among.
<br><br>
I guess, I feel sorry for the author. He will never understand what it feels like to take a step outside his own mind, and look back in from the different point of view that these chemicals provide. The author limits his own horizons of understanding because his government has force fed him from day one that drugs are evil in every way possible.
<br><br>
Ask yourself, why if drugs are so bad, am I so successful? Obviously drugs don't have the detrimental physical effects that you have been brainwashed into believing they do. I'm living proof that the goverment is lying to you, and making you now prosecute your own child.
<br><br>
I'm going to capitalize this because not many people understand the real reason the US government is so hell bent against drug use.
<br><br>
<b>THE REASON DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL IS BECAUSE THEY LOWER OUR PRODUCTIVITY.</b>
<br><br>
The United States is the most productive nation in the world. That's why we are a superpower. If we as citizen's were allowed to live a more relaxed lifestyle and more time for any recreation, including recreational drug use among other things, our nation would be less powerful that it is today. 
<br><br>
I'm not totally against that idea though. Americans work very hard, and I am proud of that. Actually as I have matured I begin to think that drug use should be controlled, for purely patriotic reasons more and more, and I do drugs less and less. However I was able to figure this out on my own, not because I was force fed this by the government. Perhaps the reason the government lies about drugs is because people like the author, and the majority of Americans are stupid. They don't want to understand, they just want to be told what to do. Mooo.
<br><br>
So Mr. Author, before you go wasting a lot of time being angry and sending letters to the FBI, and sending your curious son to unnecessary drug rehab. Take a step back and try to understand what you hate. Go smoke a joint, you probably wont like it, but at least you will know your enemy.
<br><br>
Knowledge is power, arm yourself.

<BR><BR>
The nation is powerful, yes, but who reaps the profits? Is the ability to routinely buy a new VCR each two years a marker of happiness? (Or rather a marker of poor workmanship and designing things to intentionally have limited lifetime, as it forces people to get new things if they want or not because the old ones break, which further propels the economy and strengthens the nation? But this is a question that would deserve a diary entry, or even an article, for itself.)

So if you are true patriot, do you spend more and more time in your job and less and less time with your family, as the time people spend unproductively with their family or on the beach (unless they spend money during then) weakens the nation?

That said, the responsible advice about parents being calm, and attempting to communicate and educate their children about drug use (and the perils thereof) is highly commendable.
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
Drug use (illicit, over the counter, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, whatever...) carries with it an associated degree of danger, which the user/abuser should be fully aware of. 
<BR>
&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
In my personal opinion, there is nothing immorral or wrong about drug use, but if you aren't scared of them, you should be: Perhaps drug advocacy sites should contain, or link to, a rational, empirically based study of the effects of drug use (all drugs, and both positive and negitive effects), and allow indiviuals to make up their own mind.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Had this been my son, I would have said that messing around with drugs is ok. That way he could trust me and that would open up the window for him to let me know if he had problems. I would also give him advice from my own experience, so that way he can take the drugs and wake up the next morning alive, or without a pregnant girl next to him. Instead of banning drugs, one should instead try to direct the course of drugs.

<BR>

<BR>
How can you say some things are absolutely right or absolutely wrong? Eating dogs in asian countries is fine but in the west it's wrong. How can you decide what is right and wrong?
<BR>
Would you condemn drugs if you've never tried it before? Condemn it as wrong when you have no idea yourself? Give your kids no idea aswell? How can you say liberalists don't expect nothing of themselves?
<BR>
I expect myself to live honourably, I get up everyday and fulfil all my responsibilities. And what? Us liberalists don't expect much of our kids? I don't want the kids of the future to
<BR>
follow blindly and dumbly after the generation before them. I expect them to experience life to the fullest and not take someone elses word for it. If they experience life fully, then they will learn that 
<BR>
lying is no good, cheating on your spouse is hurtful, and drugs damage your body. But taking someone elses word for it, they won't know this and eventually they may end up doing these things without the advice that a parent can give. What I propose was that
<BR>
they be allowed to learn about life, but with advice that a friendly relative could give. And maybe your right? They won't respect me. The only way they can respect me is if they see that the mature personalities I will bring up was because I didn't
<BR>
hide reality from them.
<BR>

<BR>
Look at the example of afghanistan. Movies were banned, but now that the taliban are gone, everyones flocking to see the movies. Isn't this a good example of this situation? As soon as the banning parent is away, the kids will play?
<BR>

<BR>
I don't want children to live up to my example because I admit I'm not perfect. I would rather that they do better than my example.
<BR>

<BR>
And last of all. Keep your anger to yourself. Is anger what you teach your children? I've written posts that weren't offensive, so you should follow my example.
<BR>
You need to look at this topic with more of your intellect rather than your emotion.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

By 'living honourably,' how are you not deciding what is right and wrong for yourself, every moment of every day? And why is that a bad thing to pass along to your children?
<BR>

<BR>
Face it, you've already created a moral framework for your life, and your children can be expected to follow your example because you are the example they know best. There's nothing inherently intellectual about raising children, nor are emotions inferior to intellect, as you infer at the end of your post. Nathan is reacting as he is because he feels (and thinks) strongly about this topic, as do you.

(Oh, and by the way, 'experiencing life fully' needn't encompass drug use, lying and adultery.)

<BR>
I'll apologise if you can cut and paste, and show me where it says. 'You are comparable to the taliban'. It does not clearly say anything about you.
<BR>
Next time, read it carefully and stop thinking that everything is a personal insult. Must be more of that anger.
<BR>
What I tried to do was show you to what extent setting standards could bring...
<BR>

<BR>
The comparison with eating dogs is within the scope of the convesation. Our new word for the day:
<BR>
METAPHOR: figure of speach in which term is transferred to something it does not literally apply to.
<BR>
What I'm trying to show you is that some people don't find the practice of eating dog wrong. But others do. How would
<BR>
you like it if some animal welfare guy came up to you and starting telling you that eating it was wrong? You'd say, stuff
<BR>
you, you got no ideas. In the same way, drugs should not be labelled as wrong. They are bad, but they're not wrong.
<BR>
And dog meat can lead you to prostitution, theft, murder and whatever. What if your starving, won't you steal some dog meat?
<BR>
Drugs don't lead to crime. It's a persons own personal faults that leads them to crime. Drugs are neutral, its
<BR>
what people do with it that can be upsetting. I myself smoke pot in social gatherings. Yet I don't commit any crimes. How
<BR>
can you label me with other druggies who may not function as a part of society? So no! I won't tell children that drugs are
<BR>
bad for them. It is bad for the health, but morally it isn't. If you have a faulty personality, then drugs will only show it to you.
<BR>

<BR>
Yeah right, and do you think your the only influence in your childrens life? When I was a kid, I learnt how to contruct a bong from my brother. When
<BR>
I was 13 a yr 12 student taught me how to smoke cigarettes. Of course my parents never knew because, I knew their banning attitude and ignorance to
<BR>
drugs would only stuff me up. What about your kids huh? Everyone smokes pot these days. What is it? 1 in 3 people in america have smoked pot? Do you have
<BR>
3 children? That would mean, 1 of them should have already tried. Don't tell me your kids are angels? Can you be there if they get into trouble? No, because they know you don't understand.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes and I'm gutless? No courage? Do you know how hard it is for me not to do what your doing? It takes courage to let children take a rough ride
<BR>
through life. But in the end, they will be wiser for it. It would only be too easy for me to tell them how they should live life. And ban everything they do. No, I say they be allowed to
<BR>
grow. Knowing from second hand experience, is not as good as knowing by experience. It takes courage to allow loved ones to suffer.
<BR>
saying: a true friends, stabs you in the front.
<BR>

<BR>
I decide for myself what is right and wrong. I don't impose my view on another generation. I live honourably
<BR>
by my own decision to do so and to differentiate what is good for me. Knowing the value of things yourself is
<BR>
more valuable than having others tell you.
<BR>

<BR>
The next generation after me may pick and choose whether my example is good and for them to follow. If I'm an idiot
<BR>
I don't want them to follow blindly after me. Each generation should evolve higher than their predecessors. Biologically
<BR>
and mentally.
<BR>

<BR>
When involving yourself in anything, emotion is a weakness. What is anger? What is jealousy? It is better that all emotion be
<BR>
put aside so that you can think clearly with the intellect. Otherwise, you are wearing coloured
<BR>
glasses. Many philosophers of the past have said things along these lines. I
<BR>
have yet to read the works of a philosopher who say that emotions are equal to intellect in discourse.
<BR>

<BR>
If experiencing life needn't consist of drugs, lying, and adultery. Then why does it exist? Obviously, you may think that life
<BR>
doesn't need to be this way, but other people do. You can't dictate what people can and can't experience. You can only try to 
<BR>
direct the course of these things so that the people come out of the experience, better than when they came in.
<BR>

<BR>
No hostilities intended to anyone reading this.

Let him do what he wants with his body. Oh, and those charges to your credit card were most likely used to buy seeds so he can grow his own. The "poison" being sold to your son seems to be a willing thing with him. You seem outraged that people would sell this stuff to yer kid, but if you want to be mad at anyone, be mad at yerself for invading your son's personal space. And, there isnt really anything that the FBI can do about your son getting drugs, because POT IS LEGAL THERE!!! Plus, they had no way of knowing your son was underage, cause he had yer credit card. If anyone gets in trouble, it will probably be your precious little pot head of a son. So, instead of getting these people in trouble, it will most likely be your son that is in juvie.
<BR>
    And by the way, kids arent stupid. Don't assume that they are.
<BR>
 A "QP" is a "quarter piece" A measurement for a quarter oz of marijuana. 
<BR>
  Instead of blaming your son's own free choices on everyone else (credible, legal stores who pay their taxes) try talking to your son, because apparently he needs attention. Either that or he just wants the right to smoke a joint. 
<BR>
         Get a life and stop spying on yer son.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
