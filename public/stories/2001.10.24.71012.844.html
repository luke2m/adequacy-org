		A few days ago, I wrote an article about the 'thrash metal' band Anthrax. One or two of you pointed out a few factual errors in my article, I would like to take the opportunity to correct them.<p>
I have been taken to task by the other editors here at <a href="../index.html">the most controversial site on the Internet</a>, and they have requested that I set the record straight to preserve adequacy's reputation as the Internet's premier source of controversial news and opinions.<p>
So here goes, and now maybe you teenage metalhead morons could please lay off with the death threats ? It does not do your image any good, and it doesn't scare me.<p>
And please make sure you understand me, I am correcting factual errors only. My argument that Anthrax must change their name is still valid, and still stands. In fact during the course of my research I discovered another tastelessly named band, "Biohazard" who are riding roughshod over people's feelings just like Anthrax. I'm tempted to add them to my campaign.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">I did a bit more background reading on the band, and spent some time at <a href="http://www.biohazard.com">www.anthrax.com</a> reading the fascinating details of the history of the band.<p>
Here are the errors in my article, I hope I have not missed any.<p>
<li>Anthrax are not attempting to 'cash in' on bioterrorism<br>
<li>Anthrax are not a Grind-core band, they are thrash - a completely different genre of rock.<br>
<li>Anthrax's Album 'Spreading the Disease' is not new, and contains no songs praising bioterrorism.<br>
<li>There is no evidence that Anthrax ever spent any time in an Air conditioned Winnebago<br>
<li>Anthrax are not a 'speed metal' band. Speed metal is totally different to thrash.<br>
<li>Dave Mustaine is not a member of Anthrax. Any anti-Napster statements were made by him, and not by members of the band Anthrax.<br>
<li>Joey Belladonna is not the lead singer of the band<br>
<li>Anthrax are not 'Death Metal' - they are thrash - a completely unrelated and totally different style of music<br>
<li>Anthrax have had that name for nearly 20 years, and so it was not an attempt to cash in on current events.<br><p>

Hopefully this will set the record straight. God alone knows how so many easily verifiable errors made their way into my article. It would almost have been funny, were it not so serious.<p>
Which brings me on to a final thought. Perhaps Anthrax do have a right to keep their name - who am I to judge them ? I suspect that legally there is nothing any of us can do to prevent them exercising their constitutional rights to freedom of speech. However we can influence them in a more direct way - via our wallets.<p>
Its clear that Anthrax have no intention of changing their deeply offensive name, so I am suggesting that every concerned reader of adequacy.org boycotts Anthrax until they see the error of their ways, and rename themselves. (I would accept a temporary renaming, until the Anthrax scare is over).<p>
By bringing the huge numbers of adequacy readers together to exert economic pressure on Anthrax and their record label, we can <i><strong>force</strong></i> them to listen to our concerns.<p>
When their sales figures plummet, we will soon see whether they are still keen to maintain their grossly offensive nomenclature.
<p>
I apologise for the factual errors in my story. I can only lay the blame squarely at the feet of the other editors at this site. They and they alone allowed the article in question to stay on the front page for such a long time. Even a cursory read by those lazy workshy goodfornothings would have revealed so many glaring errors that the article was almost a parody of poor journalism.<p>
But on the issue of the band name ? Three words: Change it now.      <br><br></div>

Real metalheads do live by a code of conduct-mind your own buisness.  To elaborate, if I don't physically harm (without provocation), or literally harrass you- and if we disagree, we leave each other alone.  Now I, for one, would like to exercise this belief (by the way I believe in god) but minddeadwalkinzombienazis like you and a LOT of people on this site feel that thier opinion is the only one that matters.  Personally, if you showed me irrefutable evidence that proved anthrax have been "lying in wait" of this horror for 20 years just to "cash" in now, I would concede.  Good luck finding that.  you'd have to post more retractions than that crackpot who wrote the article.  As i said in an earlier (later, depending on your narrow viewpoint) rant,  metal is basically a reaction and expression of the revolting times we live in.  Pray that the omen Megadeth carry never comes true. (if you think that Megadeth is also an offensive name thank the senate-it's a senators referall to what would happen if we unloaded the worlds nuclear resources). These names are not picked in hopes of a "death lottery" paying off only if thier name happens.  They are picked as warnings, omens of the horrors we as "HUMAN BEINGS" inflict on one another.  Anthrax do not wish people to die of anthrax (they also don't count on your dollars, they have said themselves 'metal's not supposed to be popular' from which it can be infered that money is not big on thier wish list, music is), Megadeth doesn't wish for nuclear holocaust, napalm death doesn't wish for napalm death.  Just like you they are afraid of it, unlike you they forsaw the horrible possibility.  They knew that there are hearts dark enough to want everyone dead, To cleanse the earth.  Four months ago you would have called these bands paranoid.  Four months ago the bands themselves may have thought they were just paranoid.  Paranoia is funny...it ceases to exist when the paranoid are right.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
If anything, this retraction of some of your literally brain-dead points scares me the most; it confirms that you were in fact serious to begin with, and you *were* in fact one of those reactionary offended-at-everything Clinton liberals who doesn't seem to comprehend that you do not have the right as an American citizen to not be offended.
<BR>

<BR>
The Supreme Court has upheld throughout the years that the First Amendment protects only *educated* free speech (the same idea that says yelling "Fire!" in a crowded theater is not free speech).  To that end, it's questionable whether you even really have the right to post such trash for public viewing.
<BR>

<BR>
Incidentally, you really haven't answered how you truly believed that a metal band, or any band, could become wildly popular in the span of three weeks, much less write and record an entire album with songs praising bioterrorism.  Most of us have known about the Anthrax (the powder) scare for less than two weeks.  As a musician, I can tell you with utmost certainty that not even the worst boy-band album can't be conceived, written, recorded, produced, manufactured, and distributed in less than two weeks.
<BR>

<BR>
Did you also happen to notice that, in the span of those two weeks, Anthrax (the band) just happened to conceive, write, record, produce, manufacture, and distribute *sixteen* studio albums in those same two weeks?  I certainly hope that Adequacy doesn't pay you for your work, because if you were a professional journalist working for me, you'd be looking for another job right now.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and by the way, the fact that Anthrax.com didn't offer you information about the bacteria is not the fault of Anthrax (the band), the CDC, the US government, or the Internet.  That, if anything, is the common misconception you mention in your original article.  Blame it on what has kept this country great for 200 years (and what has kept people like you in such cushioned comfort that you have time to do all your crack research): Capitalism.  When Anthrax (the band) wanted Anthrax.com, and it was available, they paid the money to get it, and they got it.  You get rid of capitalism, you get rid of America.  And I for one will fight to the death to stop you or anyone from doing that.
<BR>

<BR>
I can't stress enough that you DO NOT have the right to not be offended in this country.  If you did, the First Amendment would certainly look different, if it existed at all.  You certainly do have the right to *say* that you're offended by something, but I question *why* you're offended.  Anthrax (the bacteria) has always been something that will kill you - did Anthrax (the band) enjoy nearly 20 years of success without your resistance because *you* didn't know anything about Anthrax (the bacteria) until two weeks ago?  And for that matter, why is it suddenly "offensive" or "insensitive" to use the word Anthrax now just because it's in the news?  To me, it's more offensive that in the United States of America, I need to tread lightly for the rest of my life because you are so "politically-correct" that you instantly become offended on behalf of the millions of people in this country who don't have the capacity to hear the word "Anthrax" without passing out.  Who died and made you ombudsman for the sensitivity of the world?
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, looking at the responses you got on the first article (the guy who has his church youth group going door-to-door now on solely your word, that alone speaks volumes about his religion), if you were a real journalist you'd know that what you wrote qualifies as defamation, and I wouldn't be surprised if Anthrax (the band) was within their rights to sue you for losses generated by people believing your outright lies.  I am not an Anthrax (the band) listener, but after your article, I'm thinking about starting.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, let's revise the whole article:  I'm deeply offended by your refined hatred, and offended further that you let your hatred grow out of proportion toward things you don't fully understand.  I'm further offended by your suggestion that we go out and restrict the rights of other people by filling them with negative hate thoughts about Anthrax (the band) and preventing them from feeling comfortable with giving the music a chance to see if it's right for them, as is their right in this country.  And I'm incensed beyond belief that your unresearched, ignorant hate speech about a group of people you don't understand has garnered a powerful following on this website, your words being so powerful that hundreds of people have aligned with your cause on your lies and half-truths alone.  I'm livid that your position as a contributor here on Adequacy has served to convince people that you are somehow an authority on the subject of Anthrax (the band), and has served to artificially validate your position as an authority on the subject.  And I am saddened that for all your drivel about how hateful and hurtful and offensive Anthrax (the band) is, your words and suggestions are themselves hateful and hurtful, and they themselves offend.
<BR>

<BR>
In the spirit of your original article, therefore, I suggest we all boycott Adequacy.org, and get our news and commentary from other sources.  Once we hit Adequacy.org where it hurts - the pocketbook - maybe they'll finally get the message that we don't accept their hateful, hurtful, insensitive and offensive message and do something about it.
<BR>

<BR>
You know about Monster.com, right?  I pray that you'll need it in the near future.

<BR><BR>
For those of you interested, or who want to help me with this work, here is my tentative outline:
<ul>
<li>The beginnings, Alastair Crowley's lead disciple: Jimmy Page.
<li>The link is obvious: Black Sabbath, Grateful Dead
<li>Satanic Hair Bands of the 80's: Ozzy Osbourne, Motley Crue, Anthrax, Slayer, Judas Priest.

You seem to think that the mention of the name black sabbath is a proof in and of itself-but, you must not have known that ozzy, though he has had his problems (demons-if you show me someone who hasn't wrestled a few of their own i'll show you a liar), has been christian all his life.  Many BLACK SABBATH songs are about believing in god and protesting evils like WAR & GREED & IGNORANCE OF OTHERS.  In fact, this has been a model for heavy metal bands since the genres inception. (which started with black sabbath, not led zepplin).  many bands have taken the "shock" route in either naming thier band or in thier band's respective fundamental elements (dress, stageshow, etc.).  The likes of which-Alice Cooper (a devout christian), Megadeth (dave mustain, also a devout christian), napalm death (the name itself is a warning), and many others (anthrax-a warning realized).  Anthrax themselves have (being citizens of new york) been more tolerant than many have.  They have warned against racism, ignorance and religious zealots.  I hope you will exercise better judgement, as well as RESEARCHING SKILLS, in the future.  Religious zealots started this "war" and they WILL NOT END IT. Intelligent, well timed decisions will.  I defend your right to print what ever you want, but neither I, the bible I stand by, or the community I am PROUD to belong to (the metal community) will stand for ignorant, unfounded, unresearched drivel.  Scream satan all you want... he just may rear his ugly head.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Hey, Faulkner, I've got a great idea, too.  I'm working on a historical novel set in the Civil War.  Here's a tentative outline:
<BR>

<BR>
* Civil war erupts.  Brother turns against brother.
<BR>
* Lincoln struggles to hold the Union together.
<BR>
* Sherman burns some cities in Georgia or something.
<BR>
* Space Monkeys from Neptune descend upon Appomattox, just as the Southern forces are about to lay down their muskets; suddenly confronted by an alien menace, Americans must put aside their petty differences to defend their planet.
<BR>
* Jimmy Page joins Black Sabbath and defiles virgins while burning churches under a full moon.  No, seriously.

What does Aleister Crowley have to do with Jimmy Page? Crowley died in 1947, Jimmy Page was born in 1944. I don't know, but I bet it's hard to be a "lead disciple" when you are three, unless Jimmy Page is a genius in more ways than one.

<BR>
but anyway sometimes you can't tell what the real meaning of lyrics are so you have to listen to them with an open mind. Ian Anderson from  Jethro Tull put it best when he said "What you get from the lines of a song can be very different than what they were intended to mean" like in one of his songs he says "flying so high" many people thought he was saying he was doing drugs but when you listen to the rest of the words you find he's realy talking about rushing to the studio to record a song.
<BR>
It's easy to misconstrue lyrics but I do believe the lines from theise two performers is easily understandable
<BR>
Anthrax: Get off my case and judge yourself no one else, kill someone save a life, don't do drugs drink all night, worship jesus praise satan, opinions are all contradiction
<BR>

<BR>
Black Sabbath: I've seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways. I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days.

An I do listen to a variety of music, including Iron Maiden.  Now, if you actually bother to listen to Iron Maiden, one of the first things you'll notice, no doubt, is that they are a group of serious practicing Christians.

Thought you might also be interested to know that ever since Anton LaVey founded the Church of Satan, being a satanist has everything to do with not liking Christianity and nothing to do with your Christian devil.  If you can find out what the word "Anthropomorphic" means, you might be smart enough to read the Satanic Bible.

Their music involves NOTHING about terrorism or checmical warfare as you might get from their name.  It's mostly about the hardships many people face in life.  Dealing with society, lost love (because of death), etc.

The fact that you wrote such a snobbish response to us Anthrax fans doesn't please us anymore.  Not that we are looking to be pleased, but we are looking for a group of people that we greatly support to not be lumped into something they are not.
<BR>

<BR>
But first, I must adress something.  The death threats that you say that you have recieved I would like to apologize for.  I did not send any and I wish them not to come true.  However, calling them morons does not make you any better than them.
<BR>

<BR>
3/4 of Anthrax are natives of New York.  The band will be playing at a benefit show with many other NY hard rock/metal acts to raise money for victims, families, etc.  Just what have you done?
<BR>

<BR>
Anthrax are no supporters of terrorism nor are they terrorists.  The reason why they aren't changing their name is because they want NOTHING else to happen.  
<BR>

<BR>
Let's talk about a singer that you might be a fan of.  If a serial killer named MICHAEL BOLTON was on the loose, should MICHAEL BOLTON (the singer) change his name?  No. Would he?  No.  This is the same as anthrax and Anthrax.  
<BR>

<BR>
In response to your smartassed remarks about the errors in your first article...
<BR>

<BR>
You forgot to mention that SPREADING THE DISEASE came out a shred under two decades ago.
<BR>

<BR>
If you listen to the different generes of metal (speed, thrash, grindcore, etc), you will HEAR CLEARLY that there is a difference.
<BR>

<BR>
As for you rallying for readers not to buy the band's records, that will not hurt them because you never bought them in the first place.  The fanbase of the band has always been how the band has sold records.
<BR>

The whole reason the band is called Anthrax was because the founders thought to TAKE ADVANTAGE of exactly such a tragedy. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you name yourself after a weapon of mass distruction, and then someone actually uses that weapon, you will cash in big time on the publicity. This is precisely the purpose of this name. Get a clue.
<BR>
Or better yet just call yourself "date rapist" you stupid oppressor. We will see how far your carelessly gay attitude takes you then.

<BR>
and as for myself? I see an american citizen who served for 3 years on a S.A.R. team, preparing to pull people out of the burning wreckage of fallen aircraft or for disaster relief.  Fortunately the only real action in that respect we saw was flooding in Cincinnati, to which we were deployed for sandbagging.
<BR>

<BR>
My team was also going through "preliminary hazardous materials recovery" training.  Which means if a military plane that was carrying nuclear waste or chemical weapons went down and we were there first, we got to secure the area for cleanup.  Part of the training was videos.....Have you ever actually seen anyone die of anthrax? VX? Sarin? radiation poisoning?  (I'm asking ALL of you...not just this person) I have; rather unpleasant ways to go.  This being said, I have very strong feelings about weapons of mass destruction, but I believe that almost everyone here is overreacting.  The name may be tasteless right now in the eyes of some, but I have no problem with it.  Anthrax is a naturally occuring disease which was only really recently made into a weapon.
<BR>

<BR>
If you feel so strongly about it, we might as well ban all mention of it ANYWHERE...that along with atomic weapons (and all other weapons of mass destruction, or any other disease that has caused fatalities in the past), airplanes, United, American Airlines (those two are obviously at fault, as it was their aircraft that the terrorists used to attack the U.S. with)...you get my point.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anthrax is the name of a weapon of mass-destruction. Whatever the situation was in the past, now that is absolutely clear to everyone. Why is your band named after a weapon of mass-destruction?

When radiation was first "invented" was it for good purposes or for bad purposes?
<BR>

<BR>
I'll give you the answer: most of our current technological advances were first invented for good purposes. Now they have been perverted for bad purposes by the human race - what a surprise.
<BR>

<BR>
Furthermore, you can not "invent" a natural phenomena. You can only see it. And after you see it, nature can turn it against you by accident, or the rest of the human race can pervert this knowledge against you.
<BR>

<BR>
Anthrax are shameful hypocrites. Just like most heavy rock bands they suffer from delusions of importance. The sad thing about them is the extent of their contribution to society consists of making people think back to something horrible that has happened and in making people relive a horrible tragedy.

He was visiting for the night as a stop-point while driving from university to his parents' house.  I believe that what he was trying to say was something along the lines of "Anthrax occurs naturally and has been around for a great deal longer than many are led to belive" and thusly "Weapon Of Mass Destruction" is a misnomer(don't know if I agree with that point....but if you think about it, the flu or any other disease-causing agent could be tweaked and used the same way, but it's not considered a W.O.M.D.)
<BR>

He just woke up and tells me that he was thinking that if people are going to be getting worked up over something so immediately insignificant to their lives, we might as well ban all mention of things relating to the terrorist attacks, as they will undoubtedly offend SOMEONE somewhere (just like the entertainment industry is banning movies, games, and T.V. shows because they either 1) take place in or around the WTC or 2) deals with terrorism...even if the terrorists are the 'badguys').  This also extends this to all mention of any W.O.M.D. and anything else that could concievably be used as a weapon by terrorists.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"wigger" is a white person trying to act urban.  it is primarily derived from the word "nigger".  racism at it's finest.
<BR>

<BR>
however, a "wigger" is something i am not.  the stereotypical "wigger" wears baggy clothes, hangs out at malls, smokes pot and listens to rap music.  none of which i do.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Dear White collar suburban American racist,
<BR>

<BR>
i bet you're going to do that and get your ass kicked and your teeth knocked out.  i know if i was black and you called me a wigger, you would be on the floor.
<BR>

<BR>
and i'm sure you run into very many black people at your office or when you avoid them on the street and at malls.
<BR>

<BR>
also, you would sound very stupid since, as i said before, a wigger is a white person trying to act black.  get it right.
<BR>

I was merely inquiring what so many stupid black people felt like they were achieving by calling each other nigger. I then asked any stupid black people out there to explain this. Instead of doing this, the stupid black person that responded, insulted me.

However, not to worry, being colored myself, I have reported this hate crime to the NAACP. I am working with the Adequacy editors to track this guy's IP.<BR><br><br>

You don't know these people, some might be brave others might just be cryin' thier eyes out over a treatable black spot on their skin.  who knows.  I do know that people die of anthrax every year and they are not celebrated as beautiful examples of american strength.  How fair is that.  A year ago if 5 people contracted anthrax, even from the mail, I seriously doubt that anyone, excluding the family, would care.  They would pass on and this silly site wouldn't have any publicity itself.  Look at the facts, this site prints unresearched babbling complete with blue words linked to internet commercials, anthrax has a link to information centers and links to charities to the victims of wtc.  "adequacy" has hypocritical "christian" values when contrasted to thier articles on sex (especially that one on bukkake, if you don't know what it is look it up BEFORE you defend your site), anthrax have stayed true to themselves, thier fans, thier music, and thier beliefs for 20 yrs. (scott ian,RHYTHM GUITARIST, recently praised the holy texts-bible, koran, etc...-as beautiful books filled with truths).

Anthrax has every right to keep their name. Cars kill hundreds of thousands of people per day. Should bands called "The Cars" change their name? Should bands with the word "Suicide" in them change their name? By concluding that their name is in bad taste, you only empower the word, and affirm that the name is revelevant to our existance (obviously, far more so in light of recent events).
<BR>

<BR>
Somewhere along the line, westerners concluded entertainment should be nothing but mindless escapism; unfortunately, this attitude is responsible for breeding the disaffected comfort zone that westerners, including myself, have been violently ripped from. If you ask me, we'd all be better off if we allowed our culture to include in the harsh realities of life in their subject matter.
<BR>

<BR>
If you had your way, there would be zero public awareness of serious issues, as the original purpose of culture is to present realities we wouldn't normally think about, out of discomfort, or lack of social visibility. The name Anthrax may undoubtedly trivialize current events, but culture feeds on trivializing cultures, societies, minorities every day. Heck, in that respect, it seems like an even more appropriate name for the band. The demand that Anthrax change its name is tantamount to attempting to establish moral equivilancy between someone who could name their band that, and the people sending the letters. Infantile.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, the very fact that the original article believed that Anthrax had named themselves that in order to cash in on the situation provides frightening insight into the author's complete lack of scope. Knee-jerk articles like it are about as helpful a contribution to the solution of the problem we find ourselves in as baking an american flag cake. Which, no doubt, the author had probably already done ...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The main vibe of your piece was accusing Anthrax of cashing in on the terrorist attacks (which you later withdrew) so what's left? There's nothing in left in your article if you take out the parts about the band being insensitive, offensive and trying to exploit tragedy by being controversial.... except that Anthrax is an offensive word.
<BR>

<BR>
Well, in case you haven't noticed (and I know you have) the word "Anthrax" is listed many times in every issue of every newspaper, every day in North America. It's just a word....

You probably shouldn't write anything for public perusal again.  Nothing personal, but if you haven't even performed the most cursory research, your opinion's fairly useless.
<BR>

<BR>
However, the list of mistakes that you admitted to was absolutely hilarious.  What next?
<BR>

<BR>
"Okay, guys, I'd like to take the time to correct a few errors I made in that article last week.  Here goes:
<BR>
* Trees are made of wood, not plastic.
<BR>
* Cigarettes do not make you smarter.
<BR>
* Apparently, George W. Bush is not the Prime Minister, as I reported; I have been told by my editors that he is the President (I don't know how my editors missed that one).
<BR>
* I'm told that Anthrax is not spread through kissing.  I didn't know that.
<BR>
* There's no such country as Lesbia.  Lesbians are actually women who like other women.  Go figure.
<BR>
* New York is not the capital of the United States. 
<BR>
* I'm fairly passionate, but uninformed and unrepentant.  I like to generalize, because an "us-them" mentality is easy to embrace (examining numerous aspects of a problem is an awful lot of work, you see).
<BR>

<BR>
Tune in next week, when I explain how the Russian presence in Iraq is only exacerbating the current crisis!"

Well, whatever you write, rest assured that I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know as a wickedly funny (albeit unintentional) example of what the Internet has become: a forum for those with a desire to be heard, but no desire to do the requisite homework.

You should have done your own homework. Anthrax will never change their name I'm sure. And how can you exert economic pressure? By not buying something you wouldn't have bought anyway? The only one making the name offensive is you. By taking it in a way it was not intended. They are also not Satanic. Try reading their lyrics with an open mind. They have them on the site. Only read the current ones because I'll admit their older ones are pretty mindless. But hey they were having fun. With me many of their lyrics hit home. They are not thrash. Believe me they are not thrash. They are plain and simple Metal. Please try not to associate that type of music with satanism that is an insult to the bands. Granted there are groups that are satanic. but Anthrax is deffinately not one of them. They write songs more about personal struggle than anything. The name represents the band not the disease. And the band does not represent anything immoral. Scott Ian the spokesman for anthrax and rhythem guitarrist is very patriotic. He lives in new york and was very upset by the attacks and is scared just like all of us. I guarantee you they will keep the name as a statement of pride to say "We are Americans and we have not been changed by terror"

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">First, I want to thank DMG for delivering these enlightening articles to us -- I've been disturbed by these "satan-metal" bands for a long time and I'm always happy to see them getting widely exposed for what they are.
<BR><BR>
However, the exploitation of the tragedy doesn't just come from these satano-bands: it's also thriving in the fantasy and science fiction "literature" genre.  Fantasy "literature" has always been a haven for anti-Christian symbolism and for messages of hate and violence, from the original fantasy books by JR Tokien to the cultish <a href="./2001.8.1.165438.1158.html">Dungens and Dragons</a> roleplaying games up to the recent and widely-criticised <i>Harry Potter</i> books.  Any Christian resource site should have plenty of information on why the Fantasy genre is dangerous, so I won't beat a dead horse by covering what's already been covered.
<BR><BR>
However, there's a more recent reason for concern.  Fantasy "author" <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net/">Terry Brooks</a>, who's widely known for publishing some rabbidly anti-Christian books, has just published a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345397665/qid=1004222795/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_3_1/107-6296960-1046109">new book</a> (<a href="http://entertainment.lycos.com/features/terry_brooks.asp">another link</a> and <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net/novels/antrax.html">yet another</a>).  The name of the book -- you guessed it -- <b><i>ANTHRAX</i></b>.  The fact that Terry Brooks would decide to capitalize on the greatest tragedy in human history by naming a book after the disease currently terrorizing the nation indicates to me that she's a horrible, heartless exploiter, just like "Anthrax" the band.  I'm not sure if she's under fire for her choice of names, but I sure hope she is -- she's a coward and a monster.
<BR><BR>
If you want to tell Terry Brooks what you think of her and her new book, you can use the <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry.html">Ask Terry Brooks</a> link on her site, or use the <a href="http://www.terrybrooks.net/feedback.html">feedback form</a>, or sign her website's <a href="http://neptune.guestworld.lycos.com/wgb/wgbsign.dbm?owner=sapphirefire">guestbook</a>

<BR>
So called "fantasy novels" are never read or written by women.  
<BR>

<BR>
I think you are correct to associate the game Dungeons And Dragons with this genre of books because it seems that boys who read the books tend to play the game and vice versa.  As with fantasy novels, Dungeons And Dragons (or "DAD" as they call it) is only played by adolscent boys.  
<BR>

<BR>
I don't know why Terry Brooks has a woman's first name, but your point still stands regardless of that fact.  Even more so when you consider that the copyright for the book is "September 2001."

<br>
You are just as guilty as DMG. You claim that the new book by Terry Brooks is called "Anthrax," but by going to the sites <b>that you listed in your comment</b> it is plain to see that the title is not "Anthrax", but <b><i>"Antrax".</i></b> A subtle difference, but one that is important all the same.<br>
<br>
Fantasy writers have always come up with fantasticle names for their worlds and people. I am sure that Terry Brooks is not trying to "cash in" on the Anthrax scare. It takes a while to write a book and when the thought of coming up with the title there was no Anthrax scare. Just because it seems like an unwise title now, two weeks after the Anthrax scare started, doesn't mean that it seemed like a bad name three months ago.<br>
<br>
I won't even comment on the idea that these books are evil. Any book, including holy texts such as the bible, can be construed as being evil.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
I am sure you are aware of the recent trend in videogames and military equipment to abbreviate the word "damage" as dmg. While I appreciate your right to artistic expression, I feel that your forum name is inappropriate in these times of crisis.
<BR>

<BR>
Many people find the name of your forum alias to be offensive, and in very poor taste during these trying times. 
<BR>

<BR>
In case you were unaware, a damage indicator is used to signify bodily injury and/or mechanical and structural damage that can result in the death of one or more persons. 
<BR>

<BR>
I am sure that being a `journalist', grueling schedules notwithstanding, is nowhere near as painful as actually suffering from a damage indicator of 100%.
<BR>

<BR>
I respectfully suggest that until there is no chance that damage will ever occur to anything, that you consider changing the name of your online alias to something less offensive. 
<BR>
Perhaps you could call yourself `Communist Hippie', 'Liberal Leprechaun', `Sexual Sandbag' or something else that would preserve the continuity of your image, without causing such enormous offense to the more vulnerable members of society. 
<BR>

<BR>
It would be a great way for you to do your bit to help us heal the wounds of 11th September and join in America's fight against the terrorist menace. 
<BR>

<BR>
It need not affect your IQ. Other journalists have made similar changes with no effect on their intelligence level, for example Dan Rather changed from Connie Chung, since the word 'Chung' was an irresponsible reference to Chinese prostitutes, which could have led Caucasians astray. He chose to "do the right thing". Indeed the name change gained him a lot of poon-tang. Name changes should also apply to Stone Phillips, as we all know, `stone', `stoning', and `stoned' all refer to drug usage.  This could lead news-watching Americans down the path of drug usage and straight into the embrace of Satan&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;.
<BR>

<BR>
Thank you for reading this, and again I hope you like Walt Disney, have the courage to change your name, for the good of all Oscar-Meyer Wieners&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;.

As a swedish citizen, I find quite extraordinary that something this closed minded gets printed by any kind of news organisation. Ignorance is the most dangerous thing in the world. Ignorance is the root of all evil. And dmg shows a lot of ignorance. Go ahead, show me ANYONE that actually is hurt because a band has the name Anthrax, which they've already had for two decades. Nobody has complained for 20 years, so now it's suddenly offensive? Anthrax as a disease has existed for over a hundred years, so if anyone thought it to be offensive to have that name, don't you think they would have complained back in the day when Anthrax (the band) actually got some media exposure and sold millions of albums? 
<BR>

<BR>
When someone has anthrax, what do you think will hurt them: The actual disease or the fact a band has that name? "oh, damn, I got anthrax. it's all that band's fault".

Or is it just that you find them offenive because they are a metal band? Is it too muh for your christian fascist view on the world.

<BR>
Anthrax are participating in charity events for the victims of the tragic 9-11 events, they has put up links on their home page to pages where you can get facts on the anthrax disease, to enlighen people.

You're doing nothing but raising the level of ignorance.

You should be ashamed of yourself for writing an article without proper field research in the first place and not upset at the "lazy workshy goodfornothings" (I assume you meant to say "lazy work-shy good-for-nothings") as you call them. Your article was not "almost a parody of poor journalism." It was poor journalism. I hope you aren't paid for this or I'll be forced to quit writting so you can never be considered my peer.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Let the band be, they did not ask for this to happen. They should be allowed to keep the name they have always had. Changing their name would be another win for the terrorists. 
<BR>
"I would accept a temporary renaming, until the Anthrax scare is over". 
<BR>
What?? Nobody cares what you would accept. A "temporary renaming" is just ridiculous. What is your problem with the name, apart from it being offensive? Back when Anthrax was unheard of, nobody cared about the band name. It's not like the name "Anthrax" is going to inspire more bio-terrorism attacks or anything. The band is simply unfortunate to have chosen this name 20 YEARS AGO!!!!
<BR>
Of course you cannot legally do anything about their name. Freedom of speech means they are entitled to keep their name, that is just common sense... and that is why your article is a big waste of time. The article should have ended after that paragraph. 
<BR>
As for boycotting them, since when would any adequacy.org readers buy an Anthrax album anyway???? That really was not a valid threat.
<BR>
You must be really desperate for articles, but that does not mean you should try to hurt a band's career, that it just immature.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I am a an avid follower of Heavy Metal and must admit I havent listened to Anthrax for ages. So i must thank DMG for the reminder because the first thing I did after reading his crap was to go and find all my old Anthrax Cd's ( and Biohazard as well!!) and I gave them all a good spin, I forgot how good they really are...awesome in fact. Anyway I thought I would add this E-Mail that i received from Anthrax's record label. I hope it changes DMG's fucked up attitude...actually i don't really give a fuck either way if it does
<BR>

<BR>
In light of current events, we are changing the name of the band to something more friendly, `Basket Full Of Puppies`. Actually, just the fact that we are making jokes about our name sucks. In the twenty years we`ve been known as ANTHRAX, we never thought the day would come that our name would actually mean what it really means. When I learned about anthrax in my senior year biology class, I thought the name sounded `metal`. Everyone in my neighborhood had a band with an `er` name, like `RIPPER' or `DECEIVER' or `KILLERS' and 
<BR>
I wanted to be different. `ANTHRAX' sounded cool, aggressive, and nobody knew what it was. Until a few years ago most people thought we`d made it up. Even our album "Spreading The Disease" was just a play on the name. We were spreading our music to the masses. Before the tragedy of September 11th, the only thing scary   about ANTHRAX was our bad hair in the 80`s and the "Fistful Of Metal" album cover. Most people associated the name ANTHRAX with the band, not the germ. Now in the wake of those events, our name symbolizes fear, paranoia and death. Suddenly our name is not so cool. To be associated with these things we are against is a strange and stressful situation. To us, and to millions of people, it is just a name. We don`t want to change the name of the band, not because it would be a pain in the ass, but because we hope that no further negative events will happen and it won`t be necessary. We hope and pray that this problem goes away quietly and we all grow old and fat together. 
<BR>
Be safe, Scott, Charlie, Frank and John 
<BR>
PS: If an ANTHRAX member gets anthrax, call Alanis Morrisette. That would be ironic. Don`t you think?" 
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway DMG no hard feelings, I will see you in the Jerry Springer audience you red neck motherfucker

By your misguided theory every person in the world with the name "Osama" or "Bin Laden" should probably change their name too.  Maybe I should stop using a box cutter simply because you probably think it's now officially part of the terrorist arsenal.

In fact, the anti-Anthrax opinions, as the anti D&D opinions, are based heavily on christianity, without really understanding what christianity is : a religion of love and peace, of understanding that wasn't meant to be rigid and fix. It is to be reinterpreted and confronted to the contemporanity, to the essence of life and struggles. It is not the fuel for the Jihad against an anti misjudged "satanist" rock band. DMG fills this site with wrath. But I say peace, peace to all of ourselves. Because we must build. Because we must understand. Never stop thinking and hoping better tomorrows.

I believe that if you are so adament about your views yourself, maybe you should make known just who you are perhaps. Think about it, it's not like they don't. All of us who are fans know who they are. They don't hide around three little initials do they? No. And as for those who wish to make threats against you, they are just venting what they feel is an attack not only against a band that they love, but an attack on their freedom to enjoy what they want to. I'll place bets that you work at a Wal-Mart don't you? Probably have never drank or heard a swear word before have you? I'd love to know. You might be a nice person otherwise....but guess what? Not all of us are "teenage metalhead morons" as you so put it. Did you know that many of us listen to classic rock, country, and oh my God- Classical sometimes? I'm sorry, I said God. Does that offend you? Most of us who are Anthrax fans are not teenagers and take offense to that too. We hold full time jobs and in my case, probably have protected your sorry ass while you were walking around in public. We are from every walk of life.
<BR>

<BR>
And about Biohazard....why don't you just leave them alone too. They're from Brooklyn you know. I wouldn't doubt it if everyone from these great bands you mentioned had a loved one or knew of someone close that died in the horrific events of 9/11. Lay off it ok?
<BR>

<BR>
As for your idea about boycotting Anthrax and the like, I think it had been said by another...you're not in the demographic. And I doubt if you'll get your article published in any metal, rock or guitar magazine. Now, why don't you go to something useful like become a paperweight or something. God knows we need more of those around my office.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I'm more and more wondered from your completely empty vision of reality... The only way to boycott Anthrax is by not buying their albums: and do you really think you'll find just one metalhead who should accept this 'cause this band has an unpolitically correct name??? I don't buy an album only if I don't like it, nevermind if they are called Anthrax, Beach Boys, Bee-Gees or Genital Torturers... is it clear?
<BR>
You have not to apologize for the ridicolous errors on your past article: this just demonstrates that you're a poor journalist who doesn't know ethical duties of information either. You just write because your teacher learnt it to you, nothing less, nothing more. And another demonstration of your total ignorance is contained in a reply that you wrote for a comment on your last article, in which you report some Anthrax's songs lyrics... well, dear DMG, first off, some lyrics you wrote are not by Anthrax but Slayer! Second thing: lyrics don't matter, everyone has freedom of expression and there is no one criminal code at the world which is allowed to punish the thoughts... this is a just a prerogative of the totalitarian nazist regime, and it seems to be inside the sense of your thoughts, isn'it?
<BR>
You are socially dangerous, DMG, 'cause you really don't know how many damages could breed the ignorance which people such as you spread all over the world... Anthrax - the band - is less dangerous than you, remember...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">As a long-time fan of the band Anthrax, I was shocked to hear that a newsgroup claiming to be "the Internet's premier source of controversial news" had attacked them without knowing the facts. While I appreciate your clarification of the facts, the simple truth of the matter is, you should probably look in the mirror a little more closely. I'm quite sure that this will fall on deaf ears (and I'll explain why momentarily), but I have to vent. First of all, while I by NO means condone death threats, perhaps you should examine more closely why you received so many of them. To put it simply, YOU attacked first, blindly, and without warning or provocation. This is a band that has millions of fans worldwide, and you didn't think there would be backlash? Let me reiterate, THIS DOESN'T MAKE DEATH THREATS RIGHT. I, for one, have had quite enough senseless death and destruction for one lifetime. You, however, must shoulder some of the blame in that regard. Secondly, while I sympathize with those who have lost loved ones in these senseless biological attacks, changing a bands name doesn't change anything. I could be wrong, but I don't remember any great hue and cry for the Rolling Stones to change their name when eight people died in a rockslide in Hawaii in 1999. I don't recall anybody asking Massive Attack to change its name when 168 individuals lost their lives in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. Thousands die yearly in automobile accidents, but I still find albums by The Cars in every record store I frequent. Fact of the matter is, moving letters around can't reverse a tragedy. Painful though it may be, death happens; it's a by-product of life. Thirdly, you did neglect to inform your readership that the band Anthrax is from, (where else) New York City. Suggesting that they were insensitive to the events and aftermath of September 11th was both irresponsible and tasteless in the extreme. I truly feel sorry for the ignorant among us who look to you and your ilk for guidance in the same way I pity the ignorant followers of other misguided zealots. You are the ones who will surely bring about the death of the rest of us, who want nothing more than to live in peace. When I said in my opening that this letter would fall on deaf ears this is what I was talking about. Anyone who would write such a reckless piece of slander is obviously used to forming opinions with no use for facts, and will do anything to preserve their overinflated (and undeserved) ego trip, to include dodging the truth. I particularly enjoyed the way you cast all the blame away from yourself at the end of your "factual corrections" article: "I apologise for the factual errors in my story. I can only lay the blame squarely at the feet of the other editors at this site. They and they alone allowed the article in question to stay on the front page for such a long time. Even a cursory read by those lazy workshy goodfornothings would have revealed so many glaring errors that the article was almost a parody of poor journalism." One of your faithful lambs said, "It takes a big man to admit his mistakes," yet you claim that it wasn't YOUR fault that the article posted was so incredibly misinformed. Classic. You almost got the last part of that right, too, but you made a slight misstatement. It wasn't "almost a parody of poor journalism"; it was poor journalism that almost could have passed as parody.
