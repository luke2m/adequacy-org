This got me thinking. I know--<a href="http://slashdot.org">it doesn't happen often</a>. But we often try to focus on one trait that separates us from the <a href="www.beastiality.com">animals</a>. I like Tkatchev's (free will), and maybe this is just a different way of saying it, but here goes:
<p>
Humans do things that are rewarding <b>in and of themselves</b>. Things that are intrinsically rewarding--say a good film, a visit to the museum or a concert--are a uniquely human concept. Animals may display some intelligent behavior, but it is usually to get some sort of tactile, <a href="http://www.olivianewtonjohn.com">physical</a>, outside reward.
<p>
Of course, I wouldn't put it here if it were foolproof. I'm relying on the fine readers of <a href="../index.html">Adequacy</a> to show me the flaws in my theory.      <br><br></div>    </td>

<BR><BR>
An example that will probably be trudged up is that of the poor ol' dolphins who, as we are assured, have sex for reasons other than procreation etc. Why do they do that? Pure enjoyment? Does it increase their companionship and possibly chances of survival? 
<BR><BR>
And I'm sure there are <a href="../users/2612/index.html">monkey experiments that someone will bring up</a> to vaguely illustrate actions without reward, but,
frankly, I don't think it is that relevant in the animals vs humans debate. 
<BR><BR>
My opinion is that the trait/s that separate us from the animals are the combination of free will AND an inbuilt moral law (sense of right and wrong). The gift of free will allows us to violate the moral law of our own accord and, unfortunately for liberalists, it is that pesky thing called a conscience that informs us and nags at us when we <i>have</i> violated the law. 
<BR><BR>
I believe that the moral law was imprinted on us by God, but, for the atheists out there (are there any left?) - let's just say by some universal, higher standard. 
<BR><BR>
You could probably argue free will for animals using some obscure definition of the term, but I doubt you can argue the existence of free will and an inbuilt moral law.

Because the light in average comes from up.
<BR><BR>
The plant growth hormone degrades when lit. The side of a plant that is lit grows slower, thus the plant turns towards the light. Very simple, very effective. Explains also why plants in the darkness grow straight up but long and thin.

Do you agree that dogs do not exhibit morality in terms of what we consider decent behaviour -- fair play, unselfishness, honesty etc?
<BR><BR>
The question is then, how can I say, without a doubt, that a child instinctively knows when she/he is bad when a dog doesn't? Well of course, I can't prove it, but I can base it on my experience, my reason and the experience of others.

If you believe otherwise then that's OK. As I mentioned to someone else, if you don't believe that you have this sense of what you ought to do (a moral law), then my opinion does not apply to you and I apologise.

Correct, and both children and adults know when they have doing something wrong - tell me, why's that? Do you really believe that children start from scratch, are born devoid of morals, and then gradually learn to respect, learn to have a conscience, learn to develop their own moral code? What do they base this moral code on anyway? You do believe in a universal higher moral standard right?
<BR><BR>
I've had the pleasure of spending nearly 10 years looking after kids, I also have a 9 year old sister and 10 year old brother -- based my experience, kids sure know when they are in the wrong, even though they can't pinpoint why. 
<BR><BR>
Yes, kids can be cruel sometimes, but on the flipside to that, they have this amazing inbuilt desire to unselfishly love and care for other people, even from the youngest of ages.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
I'd agree that our concept of decent behaviour is influenced by our parents, friends etc just as everything else is, but our morality goes above social convention. 
<BR><BR>
Firstly, as I have said in other posts, the difference between moral ideas of one time or country are not as great as most people imagine.
<BR><BR>
Conventions, such as what clothes we wear and side of the road differ, but the moral teaching has a common streak that cannot be ignored.
<BR><BR>
Secondly, do you believe that American morality or Christian morality is better than Nazi morality? Do you believe it is possible that some moralities are better than others?
<BR><BR>
The moment you do, you are measuring them by a standard, some "Right Morality" and saying that some people's ideas get nearer to the Right than others.
<BR><BR>
If the moral law meant 'whatever your parents happen to approve' than there would be no sense saying that any morality is any better or worse. 
<BR><BR>
You would have absolutely no reason to condemn any moral teaching, be that of the Nazis or anyone else.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Suicide, for instance, is wrong because you have familly and friends who depend you and need you for support.  If you don't have friends or familly then that becomes a sin of omision because there is someone in the world whose life would be better for your friendship.
<BR><BR>
Granted, if you ask a three year old why it's wrong to steal she might not have a very softiscated answer.  The details and implementation of morals are somewhat unclear and we spend our lives trying to figure them out.
<BR><BR>
Saying that morals have to be taught ignores the fact that many things we teach ourselves.  "Calling people names makes them cry... ok.  Better not do that then."
<BR><BR>
Some things we do out of self interest too.  "Better not steal because I might get arrested."  I'm not sure if this really qualifies as morals.  I prefer something like "Better not take the extra change the cashier gave me or else she may get into trouble with her boss."
<BR><BR>
It seems the morals are seperated from the implementation.  The morals themselves consist of caring about the people around us.
<BR><BR>
Is this caring attitude taught?  Or can it even be taught?
<BR><BR>
The example with the children with attachment disorder shows that the children didn't learn the implementation details of morals.  They weren't taught and they weren't given the opportunity to teach themselves.  Knowing the implementation of morals is normally enough for someone to fake the motive out of self interest and become a member of society.
<BR><BR>
Obviously the children didn't know how to show love but did they actually love?  If they didn't have the capacity to love was it because they never had it and didn't learn it, or because it was beat out of them?

If you agree to the two ideas that ...

a) Yes, <i>you</i> have this idea of a moral law (dictated by your conscience) which is separate and distinct from your herd or survival instincts.

<BR><BR>
Question "b" is very difficult to answer.  So I will proceed to elaborate.
<BR><BR>
Essentially you're asking if I believe in universal morality.  I suppose my only alternative is to be a moral relativist.  Within a culture I do believe there are some universal moral truths.  <i>Maybe</i> it's even possible to say that for all of humanity - maybe we could identify a few "moral laws" that are universally accepted, like "it's wrong to torture your Mother".  I think morality is culturally transmitted.  There are many layers of culture that each of us live in.  There's Western culture, American, European, local, workplace, family, school, various subcultures.  Our moral systems are more complex and refined within these smaller spheres.  People who are members of different subcultures will have different opinions about what is right and wrong on certain subjects.
<BR><BR>
If you look at Western culture and try to identify some moral laws held in common by all westerners, you'll find that there are still other cultures in the world which don't hold those values.  For example, it seems to be a common western value that women deserve the opportunity to become educated.  Not all cultures believe this, obviously, like our foes in Afghanistan.  So, are we right and they are wrong?  According to us, yes.  According to them, it's the other way around.  It's often said of relativists that if they don't believe in a universal "truth" then anything goes.  I don't believe anything goes, but no matter how true I believe some of my morals to be, there are other people who don't agree.  I'm not saying that's just swell, because obviously we can't get along in a society where people disagree about too many things.  Disagreement over very big issues is how we end up in wars.  There's no easy answer, like "there's one universal truth", or "who cares, let everybody do whatever they want".  When cultures with conflicting moral codes meet, they often <i>clash</i>.  They're both "right".  Some issues are small enough that you can live and let live, but other issues are so large that we absolutely can't allow our "right" to be tromped upon by someone else's "right", so we fight to the death.
<BR><BR>
I guess conflict is just inevitable.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
<i>Maybe it's even possible to say that for all of humanity - maybe we could identify a few "moral laws" that are universally accepted, like "it's wrong to torture your Mother</i>
<BR><BR>
I think if we are identifying moral laws in terms of always undertaking or not undertaking a particular action (e.g. abortion, torturing your Mother) then it is pretty clear that this is not something universally accepted.
<BR><BR>
That's why I believe that this moral law I talk about is at a much higher level than a particular action -- it is about a common theme behind the actions; it is about a commonality in what we perceive as decent behaviour. 
<BR><BR>
A particular action may be "right" in one context and "wrong" in another, but the same theme is being followed out in both cases.
<BR><BR>
Those themes that I believe are universal to humanity consist of (but are not limited to) - fair play, unselfishness, courage, good faith, honesty and truthfulness.
<BR><BR>
<i>Our moral systems are more complex and refined within these smaller spheres.</i>
<BR><BR>
Definitely. The level of complexity in a particular moral system is very specific to a particular subculture. I still believe that you would find a common undercurrent and theme throughout them though.
<BR><BR>
I think the key thing is that you are thinking of a moral law in terms of specifics (e.g. social conventions, like what kind of clothes people wear, should women be educated etc) when I am thinking of a moral law in terms of generic teachings (e.g. that we ought to be unselfish).
<BR><BR>
<i>It's often said of relativists that if they don't believe in a universal "truth" then anything goes. I don't believe anything goes, but no matter how true I believe some of my morals to be, there are other people who don't agree.</i>
<BR><BR>
I understand. I used to be pretty much an atheist (less than a year ago) and I too tried to find this nice balance between not believing in universal standard of morality but at the same time not believing that anything is acceptable. Unfortunately, I don't think that there really is any middle ground, either you believe that there is a universal moral standard by which we can judge whether something is more or less moral, or we must believe that morality is up the individual, in which case we have no right to tell a person/society they are "wrong" or "right". If their moral framework says that murdering someone is OK, that acts of terrorism are OK, then we can't really argue.
<BR><BR>
The implication of having a universal moral standard is that it goes beyond something that is simply taught to us to parents or friends. What we are taught may indeed closely follow the standard (after all the people who teach us are also under the influence of it) but it is not responsible for it.
<BR><BR>
The implication of moral relativity, however, is that our moral standard is solely based on what we are taught. Here lies our major difference. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Depends if it is your battle. If you are fighting it by your own will (then it's your choice and you should stick with it), or if you are just a mere conscript who would prefer to be elsewhere (then run away and save your ass, if you were unable to dodge the draft). Better be live coward than dead hero.

Knowing Jesus is not a prerequisite for obtaining this moral law. It is literally <i>built</i> into us at birth -- all of us. Sure we may try and deaden it over time either by conditioning or choice, but it's there in all of us to start with, no matter what culture, country or time we are born.

<BR><BR>
You have to remember though, that just because a moral law exists, it doesn't mean we are obliged to follow it. In fact the realisation that we regularly fall short of this law, or disobey it, is a fundamental feature of human nature (all have sinned etc) -- at least according to Christian theology. We know how we ought to behave and yet we don't behave that way.
<BR><BR>
As strange as it may sound, even groups like cannibals (and latmuls?) may still value things such as fair play, courage, good faith, honesty and truthfulness.
<BR><BR>
Of course, if you do not feel that something the equivalent of a Moral Law (a sense of what we ought to do) exists or applies to you, then I apologise, my opinion does not apply to you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This example of a functional society with quite foriegn norms tends to be rather awkward for the  "we are all the same" brigade.

<i>Of course, there are many examples of groups (e.g. cannibals, the Nazis) which apparently contravene the idea of a universal moral law</i>.<BR><BR>
I take exception to the juxtaposition of Nazis with cannibals here, because in the case of Nazis there was a definite rejection of what you term 'Moral Law'. I don't think you can simply extrapolate the same rejection onto cannibalistic societies.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
Studying the collective behaviour of a society would not indicate a moral law (in nearly all cases), you're right. However, studying the moral teachings of the society may do so. Of course, in practice, these moral teachings may be very poorly put to use, but that is not to say that they do not exist.
<BR><BR>
If the only thing we had to go on was an observance of collective behaviour -- viewed from the perspective of a third party -- with no knowledge of ourselves, or of the moral teachings of other times/countries/societies etc, then of course we would have no idea that there exists this concept of a moral law.
<BR><BR>
However, we do have knowledge of these moral teachings and we do have some inside information, namely ourselves.  
<BR><BR>
So, if we are to admit that there is indeed some moral law inside us, this conductor of our instincts and sense of what we ought to do then we should enquire as to whether this is a common feature of man or peculiar to ourselves.
<BR><BR>
A key question at this stage really is -- Do you yourself believe that you experience this moral law? If not, then it is pointless to discuss this any further.
<BR><BR>
However, if you do agree then the next questions are: Do you consider that someone or some group can have a higher morality (more decent behaviour) than another? Do you assume everyone else to have some moral standard they should adhere to or know about etc (e.g. implied when you think things like "that's not fair", "that's not honest", "that's selfish", "he shouldn't kill him")? If the answers are still yes, then what you are really saying is that there is some common, higher standard of morality which you are basing this on. Do you agree with me on this? If not, then again it is pointless for us to discuss this any further.
<BR><BR>
OK, assuming you are still with me, the question remaining is whether knowledge of this higher moral law is something we simply learn from our society and education (and by sheer coincidence happens to have a commanility running through it, which transcends time and country) or whether it is something more fundamental than that.
<BR><BR>
My reasoning boils down to this:
<BR><BR>
a)	I experience this effect of a moral law myself (though I frequently do not do what this law tells me to do) 
<BR><BR>
b)	Many other people that I have spoken to have admitted that they also experience this law (and none have flat out denied it). The nature of the law they describe is strikingly similar to mine.
<BR><BR>
c)	A study of other times and cultures has shown that their moral teaching also has a striking commonality running through it. This commonality also ties in with mine.
<BR><BR>
Therefore I have assumed that there is indeed a universal, inbuilt moral law.

<BR><BR>
What you believe <i>is</i> highly relevant and it's not really about agreeing with <i>my</i> moral principles, at least not to begin with. If you personally do not believe that you have a sense of right and wrong, a sense of what you ought to do (though you may not follow it most of the time) which is separate and distinct from your herd or survival instincts then it is irrelevant whether it is universal or not. End of discussion. You disagree with me, no problems at all.
<BR><BR>
If you agree that yes, you have this "thing",  <i>then</i> can we can consider if this "thing" is indeed common to everyone, whether it is funcamental law of man or simply something we learn.
<BR><BR>
<i>This is hard to do with pre-literate societies. In such situations you have to examine their collective myths, taboos, and sense of justice</i>
<BR><BR>
Well yes, with pre-literate societies it is harder to pinpoint what their moral teaching was because have a lot less information to go on. We need to study things apart from explicit writings per se. However, you can still identify a moral teaching with enough study of the history and context of the society and the particular teaching mechanism they used (be that via symbols on a cave, their customs, rituals or whatever).
<BR><BR>
<i>along with how the society operates.</i>
<BR><BR>
No! How the society actually operates may have nothing to do with what their moral teaching is. You can't use the actual behaviour of a society, you need to use their <i>teachings</i> -- what they considered decent behaviour or Right Morality - not how they put it into practice. The same thing applies today - we rarely behave as we think we ought to, despite what we may say and write. If you were to look around the world today, you would hardly think that we have a moral law inside us would you! That's why, if we didn't have ourselves as a starting point, if we were observing man as a third party, we would have no reason to believe a moral law exists at all. 
<BR><BR>
<i>We live in a particular society, at a partcular point in time and have grown up imbibed in that societies norms. These morals are taught and learnt.</i>
<BR><BR>
OK, let me ask again, do you think it possible for one society or person to be more moral than another? What would you be basing this "more" on? 
<BR><BR>
From what I have read, you seem to be a moral relativist - that nobodies behaviour can be judged as "right" or "wrong" as such, it's all just relative. Therefore you have no right to condemn the Nazis, the Crusaders or child rapists, after all, who are you to say what is right and wrong behaviour.
<BR><BR>
If you say with respect to a question like "Why ought I to be unselfish, why ought I not kill someone" that "Because it is good for society", then I may ask "Why should I care what's good for society except when it happens to pay me personally?" Then you might say, "Because you ought to be unselfish" - which simply gets us back to the beginning. We have not progressed. 
<BR><BR>
Trying to benefit society (by being unselfish) is one of the things that decent behaviour consists of; all you are really saying is that decent behaviour is decent behaviour. 
<BR><BR>
<i>Do you believe in the same moral code?</i>
<BR><BR>
Well again, since my sense of right and wrong cannot be identified as always following a given instinct (e.g. fighting, sex, survival). I can't give a definitive yes and no for every instance. Actions that are blatently wrong in some context may be right in another. I can say that yes, I would think that abortion or denying someone the right to die can be "wrong" but I can also imagine times when it might be right (if the woman was raped, if someone was high on drugs when they decided they wanted to die). You can't pinpoint right and wrong as always executing a particular action. You can however take it to a higher level and identify a common theme of right and wrong (e.g. unselfishness, fair play, honesty, courage).

Saying that each of us has a sense of right and wrong, or fairness, or whatever, does not mean that there is a 'universal morality'. We can all differ wildly in what we honestly consider fair and just.<BR><BR>

<i>OK, let me ask again, do you think it possible for one society or person to be more moral than another? What would you be basing this "more" on?</i><BR><BR>
Yes. I would be basing that on my sense of 'morality'. I don't expect this to accord with any moral sense that you may have.<BR><BR>

<i>From what I have read, you seem to be a moral relativist - that nobodies behaviour can be judged as "right" or "wrong" as such, it's all just relative.</i><BR><BR>

Some would argue that 'selfishness' is a greater benefit to society than 'unselfishness' and thus it is more moral to be 'selfish'.<BR><BR>

<i>Well again, since my sense of right and wrong cannot be identified as always following a given instinct (e.g. fighting, sex, survival). I can't give a definitive yes and no for every instance.</i><BR><BR>
Now that is moral relativism.<BR><BR>
To me the three examples above are absolutes. As is the belief that the act of "buying and selling" is a moral outrage, and any one caught doing so ought to be stoned to death.<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>
Well, yes there can be some large variations in what we perceive to be fair and just, remember, we can only go on the facts available to us. If I thought that all football players were satanic axe murderers (a wrong assumption), for example, then I may consider it fair and just to put them in prison for life. If I thought that they were not all murderers (a correct assumption) then I would consider it unjust.
<BR><BR>
However we are agreeing that we ought to be fair and just in the first place. Why's that? Why not be unfair and unjust?
<BR><BR>
<i>Yes. I would be basing that on my sense of 'morality'. I don't expect this to accord with any moral sense that you may have.</i>
<BR><BR>
Ah. Moral relatvism at its best. At least your being honest. Just means you can't call anyone more or less moral than anyone else, that's all. If someone decides murder and adult rape is OK, then even though <i>you</i> may consider it wrong, you can't say it is "wrong" in principle.
<BR><BR>
<i>I note that you have left out 'adult rapists' from your list of things to be condemned.</i>
<BR><BR>
I added them to my list above just for your benefit. Don't say I don't do anything for you k?
<BR><BR>
<i>Some would argue that 'selfishness' is a greater benefit to society than 'unselfishness' and thus it is more moral to be 'selfish'.</i>
<BR><BR>
Uh, and those people would be who exactly? Care to name any major society which valued unselfishness. Certainly wasn't the Babylonians, Egyptians, Chinese, Greeks, Romans or Egyptians.
<BR><BR>
<i>Me: I can't give a definitive yes and no for every instance. .... You: Now that is moral relativism.</i>
<BR><BR>
You still aren't getting my point. This is not moral relativism at all. My theme of morality has not changed one bit, the action however may indeed be different, depending on the situation. Surely you can think of many situations in which you can have two different actions, in two different contexts, but both of which follow the same theme (e.g. being unselfish, fair play). 
<BR><BR>
For example, giving someone $5 for food might be unselfish if you had $10 to your name. Giving someone $5 for a day's work when you yourself are a millionaire would be selfish. 
<BR><BR>
Again, a moral law is not based on always carrying out a particular action. It is based on always following a particular theme (though of course, despite what our moral law may tell us, we usually choose to ignore it).

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You are correct in one sense. Our moral law will often lead to behaviour that <i>will</i> enhance our relationships or chance of survival - e.g. unselfishness, honesty, fair play. 
<BR><BR>
Often, however, our moral law asks us to do something that will result in the exact opposite.
<BR><BR>
It means keeping promises you would rather not keep, doing your work honestly when it would have been much easier to cheat, telling the truth even though it may make you look like a fool.
<BR><BR>
For example (and I am not great at examples), if you tell a slanderous lie about someone (who had done nothing to you) behind their back, say this person was 6" 9', weighed 500 pounds and would kick anyone's ass if they even looked at them the wrong way, your conscience will, if you haven't deadened it enough, play on your mind. Now, would admitting that you have lied to that person and apologising to their face enhance your survival chances? What about your companionship (now that you have admitted you are a liar)?

The moral law is not simply behaviour that just happens to be useful to us.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I'll try and get my hands on your recommendation. I must admit though, becoming a successful businessman is not one of my priorities in life, but I am interested none the less.
<BR><BR>
My recommendation would be to read Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis - just read the first 5 chapters - despite the title it is not a book targeted at Christians, it is simply an explanation of the core ideas behind Christianity, one of them being this idea of a moral law (something which tells us what we ought to do in a given situation, not necessarily what we <i>want</i> to do) that all of us possess. 
<BR><BR>
Lewis explains this concept of a moral law much better than I can. I'd be interested in your comments on it.
<BR><BR>
However, I still think we have this key issue regarding survival or herd instincts vs a moral law. 
<BR><BR>
Yes, cooperative behaviour can have long term benefits and lead to a "winning scenario", depending on what we think of as a "win" (fame? riches? relationships?). It could also have severely negative outcomes, for example, blindly cooperating with a government or a group that wanted to do you in once your usefulness to them ran out. I'd tend to agree with what other people have said/written, that cooperation could be described as one of our herd instincts.
<BR><BR>
A moral law, however, goes far above herd instincts. It is the thing that judges between two instincts, the conductor of our instincts as such. 
<BR><BR>
In some situations the law may say that an instinct like cooperation is the decent or right behaviour, in some it may say the complete opposite.
<BR><BR>
Let me give you an example adapted from Lewis:
<BR><BR>
Suppose you hear a cry from a man in danger, imagine it was someone trapped in the fire of the WTC. You will probably feel two instincts - one a desire to give help (due to your herd instinct), the other a desire to keep out of danger (due to the instinct for self-preservation). You will find inside of you, in addition to these two impulses, a third thing which tells you that you <i>ought</i> to follow the impulse to help, and suppress the impulse to run away. 
<BR><BR>
The thing that judges between the two instincts cannot itself be either of them, it would be like saying that a sheet of music which tells you, at a given moment, to play one note on the piano and not another, is itself one of the notes of the keyboard.
<BR><BR>
Lewis then goes on to say that (and I'll try to avoid plagiarism to a minimum from now on) if there are two instincts in conflict and there is nothing in our minds except these two instincts, then obviously the stronger of the two instincts must win. But our Moral Law usually seems to be telling us to side with the weaker of the two impulses (e.g. you want to be safe more than help, but the Moral law says to help all the same).
<BR><BR>
The moral law cannot itself be an instinct - if it was then we could say that decent behaviour could be defined as always following a particular instinct, for example, cooperation, sex or the fighting instinct.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
