		In the days following the horrific attack on America and the subsequent war on Islam, the reaction from the world community was predictable. The Europeans spent a day or two wringing their hands and telling everybody how shocked they were, and then immediately went back to their anti-American agenda. The Asians have been sympathetic, but unhelpful. Similarly, the South Americans have been able to muster very little more than empty words of support, given their weak economy. The Africans, by and large, are unaware that things such as New York City and airplanes exist. And the reaction from Muslim nations could most aptly be described as one of restrained glee.<P>

Through it all, our lone ally in this struggle has been the nation of Israel. This is a battle between good and evil; it is a struggle of right versus wrong. There is no "middle ground" to occupy in this conflict, and Israel is the only nation that has decisively sided with Good. Unfortunately, Israel has her enemies as well, and she has no greater enemy than the Nazi party.<P>

So what do you do when you discover that one of your co-workers is a Nazi?        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">It all started innocently enough. I am a software engineer, and my development team had just finished the work for a major release. We wanted to change the main color in our GUI from LightBlue to SteelBlue, and our 6.0 release incorporated this modification. This was a lot of work; we ended up having to replace about 613 hardcoded references to "LightBlue." We also fixed a bug where right-clicking on the status bar would cause the GUI to core dump. Incidentally, you hear a lot of talk about how Linux (which is the OS we're using) is better than Windows, but when was the last time you heard of a Windows machine "core dumping?" Hopefully, our 7.0 release will consist of a port to Windows so that we can put an end to this nonsense.<P>

Anyway, to celebrate this milestone, I decided to take my software team out for dinner. We went to a steakhouse which, despite the fact that it serves alcohol, is a pretty decent place to eat. The food was delicious, and after we had finished the meal, we remained at the table and discussed various topics. The talk inevitably turned to politics, and one of the subjects that came up was the Palestinian war against Israeli women and children. We talked about counter-terrorism measures, security procedures, and the ridiculousness of the Koran. It was at this point that things went south.<P>

One of my developers started talking about Israel in a manner that, quite frankly, stunned me. He mentioned that Israel was erecting settlements in Palestinian terrortories (I'm sorry, I meant "territories") and ventured the opinion that these settlements were illegal. He repeated Islamic rumors about Israeli Defense Force (IDF) troops blocking pregnant women from getting access to hospitals, which resulted in stillborn children. He spewed out ridiculous racial innuendo about Israeli troops spray-painting threats on Palestinian billboards. He spoke negatively about the actions of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. In short, he levied so many accusations and aimed so much anti-Semetic hatred against the people of Israel that it became clear that he was allying himself with Israel's worst enemy.<P>

It was at this point that I realized the truth: <I>a Nazi walked among us.</I><P>

There was a man named Adolf Hitler who held similar convictions, and it took a bloody world war to get rid of him. And here I was having lunch with his (apparent) genetic clone. It amazes me that speaking against Israel in such a derogatory and spiteful tone remains legal in the United States, particularly in light of recent events. Oh, you can be sure that I behaved diplomatically; through all of this hate speech, I nodded politely and even managed to keep a smile on my face despite the fact that I wanted to take this guy outside and blacken a couple of his eyes.<P>

When we got back to the office, I decided that I needed to keep a close eye on this man. I have an SGI O2 workstation with a webcam. I waited until everybody left and then repositioned the webcam so that it looked in on his cubicle; this was tricky and required me to run wiring through the ceiling tiles, but the result is that I can constantly surveil this man and make sure that he is not participating in such activities as reading <I>Mein Kampf</I> or meeting with officials of the German government. I installed an Ethernet sniffer so that I can track his Internet traffic; if he reads any Nazi Web sites at work, I will have irrefutable proof that I can present to my employer as grounds for dismissal. I've found that he spends lots of time perusing CNN.com, which is evidence of his left-wing, National Socialist (Nazi) leanings.<P>

My wife and I have decided to take turns watching his house. She takes the day shift, while I'm at work; she tirelessly watches their property in our minivan with our two children. She has claimed to have seen a Nazi flag hanging on his living room wall during the brief moments that his front door is open, though she admits that this might be a Rusty Wallace poster. I watch his house at night. Several times I have seen unknown persons go into his residence; how am I to know if these people are not officials from the German or Soviet governments?<P>

One thing is clear: I have a Nazi, a thick-eyebrowed cunting Hun, working with me. How should I deal with this? I believe that I have enough evidence to get him fired if I were to go to my management. However, I'm not sure; in today's lawyer-friendly environment, is anecdotal evidence enough? I'm considering taking a tape recorder to his office, hiding it in my suit coat, and trying to get him to make some of his anti-Jewish comments so that they can be recorded. With this, I should have no problem getting him fired.<P>

Beyond that, I am this man's direct supervisor; though he has always been very efficient and thorough, I could invent false claims of bungling and shoddy work. This introduces obvious moral and ethical questions, but the greater principle ought to be the guiding principle; is a man who is so blatantly anti-Jewish deserving of gainful employment at a moral code shop? I believe the answer to that question is an unequivocal "no." With this in mind, I am willing to take whatever steps are necessary to get him <I>out</I>. I will not tolerate anti-Semetism on my team, and as far as I'm concerned, the end justifies the means. A terror supporter is not somebody I want on my team.      <br><br></div>

<BR><BR>A comment on this.  In Europe, several countries, for example Germany and France, have "anti-Nazi" laws, that supposedly forbid Nazism within the country.  But, if you take a look at the prevailing attitudes in these countries, you'll find widespread hatred of Israel among the population.
<BR><BR>This proves a point I had long suspected: <i>Germans are, by and large, criminals, even by their own standards.</i>
<BR><BR>This should of course come as no surprise to people, like me, who have come to discover the principle of  <a href="./2001.7.26.151249.364.html">linguistic determinism</a>, and thus know that some peoples, like the Germans, the Japanese or the Belhare, because of the structure of their language, are more prone to authoritarianism than others.  But it is good to have even more striking confirmation of this.<BR><b>--em<br>

But you will know soon. Its easy to gather from your article, that you are straight on your way to it.
<BR>

<BR>
and cogratulations you managed to offend about a hundred million people (half the population of the US) to be criminals.
<BR>

<BR>
publications like yours about the german language were very popular during the Nazi regime to proof the inferiority of jewish citizens in a pseudo-scientific way (particular by social darwinism). Fortunately they are now forbidden by anti-nazi laws.

<BR><BR>it's appalling, the amount of disinformation spread on this website.  if Germans criticize Israel, it's because they're opposed to the practices and policies of the Israeli government.  Hitler never won a legitimate majority in any election; he had no popular support in Germany until the people were subdued into supporting him.  

<BR><BR>hell, I'm opposed to the practices and policies of the Israeli government.  I'm a criminal then, I suppose, though I hardly subscribe to anti-Semitism.  

<BR><BR>I think that Germans in the last 20-30 years have been able gradually to overcome the shame of the war, as the last of the old leaders of the regime--those actually responsible--meet prosecution and people who were actually there get too old to remember much of it.  so why are they suddenly getting all this insubstantiated flack for nationalism--it's the Dutch and the French with resurgent right-wing political movements.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Israel? Don't love it, don't hate it. I think it has a right to exist, and more, a right to live in peace. I think the same thing about a palestinian state.

And while I think terrorism is innaceptable, I do not think Israel is always right.

And one more thing, for those willing to judge my position, I am European, and worse, French. And if I believe what I can read on most American sites, and we know American media is the best and just tells the truth, I am a citizen of the most anti-semitic nation on earth. I wonder why Bush didn't put us French as prominent members of the axis of evil.

let me make a suggestion for the next time:

whats about:

moslems
<BR>
homosexuals
<BR>
asians
<BR>
anarchists
<BR>
catholics
<BR>
pot smokers

and if we wait a bit, YOU will manage it to use Jews as well (because they have a long tradition of been victims of paranoid facists)

That I have. For about a year, I left copies of various correct-thinking publications laying in his cubicle (i.e., <i>WorldNet</i>, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, <i>Focus on the Family</i>, etc.) I don't think that he ever found out that it was me, but it did have an effect on him. His work output declined, his political outbursts waned, and he constantly appeared to be tired. Not long after that, he resigned and accepted a new job in Europe (surprise, surprise.) Now he's on the other side of the Atlantic with his blood brethren. I may not have been able to convert him, but at least I got him <i>out</i> of there, which is the least that my family and I could do.<BR><BR>

Beg pardon? "Unguilty?" If you had heard some of the things that this butcher said about Israeli "military incursions" and United Nations "resolutions" and the "plight" of the Palestinian "people", you would not so wantonly toss around words like "unguilty." This guy ought to have a swastika tattooed on his forehead. The Communist is gone, and if there is any justice in the world, this Nazi will soon be behind him.<BR><BR>

<i>...Or are you just a troll, who copied his comunism story (the stories are quite similar, aren't they?)</i><BR><BR>

<b>Bingo.</b> The stories <i>are</i> quite similar, aren't they? And that's <i>the whole point.</i> There are many regular Adequacy.org readers who, like myself, are members of the moral community. And the point of all this is that we see more and more of these leftivists (Communists, Nazis, etc.) infiltrating our previously-secure institutions. The stories are similar because these people are popping up with alarming regularity, and if we are to preserve the moral foundation of the United States of America, we must act in a principled and just manner, such as the strategy that I have outlined above. I do not apologize for this, and no correct-thinking person <i>should</i>.<BR><br>--<br><i>Red-blooded patriots do not use Linux.</i><BR></FONT></td>

The Palestinians were kicked out of every place they've ever lived, as have the Israelis.  The israeli military is still trigger-happy from DEFENDING themselves against the muslims, and are, as such, brutal mo-fos.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, as for taking palestinian territory, I don't understand why WE are allied with israel.  Any other time one country moves in on another, we go in and tell everyone to chill out: "We don't approve and have bigger guns, so just cut that shit out."
<BR>

<BR>
The palestinian people deserve a country, just as the israelis did in the 50's.  But the truth is, until  the palestinian gov't-pro-tem can get control of is watch, there's no reason for it to be in power.
<BR>

<BR>
Granted, the problems between muslims and the rest of the world is in their original code of law, however, the great majority of muslims are much like the great majority of catholics:  "We don't apporve of the old ways, and we wish the fundamentalists would just fucking croak.  They just make us look bad."

Osama Bin Laden = Jerry Falwell?  Not in magnitude, but certainly in annoyance.  I just simply can't STAND hearing fucking preachers.  They're almost as bad as advertisers (at the very least, preachers have a cloak of belief around them.  It seems a bit more altruistic that way).

The humbling truth that you must accept is that you actually had nothing to say.  You had a gut reaction, a visceral response, and since you had no explosives on hand with which to slay innocent civilians, you hit your keyboard.  The keyboard, after all, can't fight back.

It is ok to be wrong.  Nobody will ridicule you for that.  However, it is a fool's gambit to try to pass off an accusation of "ignorance" as a rebuttal.  If you're going to be wrong, at least put some effort into it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Whilst you have a right to express the opinion that the world is round, that God does not exist, and that communism is bad, and microsoft is evil. You are not bound by patriotism to hold such opinion. In fact by being patriotic you should hold the opinion that - the world is flat, God exists, communism is bad, and lunix is the devil's spawn.

Certainly more so than Joe McCarthy (who, history has demonstrated, was largely right about the seventy-three card-carrying communists in the state department.  Oh, but I suppose the fact that they were indeed shown to ACTUALLY POSESS CARDS IDENTIFYING THEM AS MEMBERS OF CPUSA means nothing to you liberal types.  Facts, and all, meaning nothing in your cosmology exorcised of the horrors of a loving God.)
<BR><BR>
What the secular humanists did -- and what most liberalist/terrorist groups are trying to do today, in the post-11/9 era -- is to bring a fetid veil of "political correctness" down over the American mind.  They do this to prevent the free flow of ideas, to prevent people from discussing the real dangers of the terrorism those selfsame liberals condone.
<BR><BR>I bring a challenge for you -- yes, even you, someone hiding behind his anonymity -- and all the other liberals and Muslims who read the above post with sympathy, to come up with EVEN ONE THING McCarthy said that was wrong.  Just try.  Then, if you have the character to admit your mistakes, I challenge you to compare McCarthy's role as a solitary protector of a free America with that of Paul McCartney and the rest of his ilk.  What was their motto?  Oh, I remember.
<BR><BR>
"All you need is love."
<BR><BR>
Just try telling that to the people who died in the World Trade Center.<BR><BR><BR>

You haven't got any health care.  Well, you do, but you have to pay for it yourself!  What does the government spend your taxes on?
<BR>

<BR>
Your laws are slowly strangling you.  No-one wants to go to America, because you arrest people and lock them up indefinitely without trial.  If you can't afford to bribe the judge, you'll go to jail.
<BR>

<BR>
Your country is dying on its knees, and it's your own government that's killing it.  Go and exercise that Second Amendment right that all you Americans seem to love so much.  That's what it's there for.  Oh, but make sure they don't call you a terrorist....<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
From our correspondant in ...What's the name of the damned hole again?
<BR>

<BR>
In this one great nation under God, there is a little town gloriously conquered over those Mexican bean eaters (to my surprise, we have something in common: the Rio Grande!) during our great march to the West, fullfilling our Manifest Destiny (why the hell the government hasn't done anything yet about that ocean limiting our destiny?) we have met young HB who miraculously found the reason and the solution to one of the greatest problem in this God fearing land.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: Tell us how it happened.
<BR>

<BR>
HB: Oh, I was alone playing with my friend Dick at Grandpa's house when I found the old binoculars. I look trough it and bam! I saw the world as everybody should see it, with a lot of details. It helped me see, and understand, a good bunch of things I was previously ignoring.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: What did you see?
<BR>

<BR>
HB: The world is a whole mess, except here in America. The reason is that America is full of Americans, while the rest of the world is plagued with foreigners.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: And ..??
<BR>

<BR>
HB: Well, we know all that is good comes from America (beer, coca-cola, McDonald's, Ford Chevy, Smith and Wesson, etc), and all that is bad comes from those foreigners. They hate us because we are good. They sneak into this country where everything would be safe, except for those foreign nazis and communists. And that is the explanation.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: ???
<BR>

<BR>
HB: You agree with me about the safety of this nation. Well, we don't have native criminals. If and when we are unsafe, it's allways because of some foreigner. This great nation is the first in everything, and we are the first in the number of prisons and the number of prisonners, thanks to the best police force and the best judicial system. Our jails are full of foreigners.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: You have brilliantly demonstrated the reason. Now what is your solution?
<BR>

<BR>
HB: Death penalty for all of them. Empty our jails, send all those foreigners to some place like Iran, or Irak, or Palestine, or Scotland (I have heard the damned faggots wear skirts!), or France (I can't believe such a place exists), or Afghanistan, and nuke the place. Rapid, economical, sensitive.
<BR>

<BR>
BW: But, the rest of them, the rest of the world?
<BR>

<BR>
HB: Sincerely, we should nuke everything. No more foreigners, no more nazis, no more communists, no more danger. Please tell the President.
<BR>

<BR>
HB went to do whatever he had to do, happy to have modestly contributed to a better world. I took the binoculars he had left there, looked, and didn't see anything. There were at least two centuries of dust on the lenses.

<BR>
Nazism, by the very basic definition, is a belief wherein you hate Jews.
<BR>
The Israeli Government is basically, the government of the country of Israel. Hence, Ariel Sharon is the Prime Minister of Israel.
<BR>
Jews, is the term given for people who practice Judaism as a religion.
<BR>
There is a very big difference between the Israeli Government, and Jews. Like I said, the Israeli Government is the government of the country of Israel. The country of Israel, is a country that is comprised of PEOPLE. Some Jews, some Arabs, etc. etc. They are not comprised entirely of Jews.
<BR>
Also, there is a difference between hating the Jews as a race or as a people and disliking the political actions of the Israeli Government.
<BR>
Thus, your office mate, upon making it clear that he dislikes the political actions of the Israeli Government, ISN'T a Nazi, but rather a person with a certain political view of the Israeli Government.
<BR>
Personally, I also don't like the recent actions of the Israeli Government under Ariel Sharon with regards to the Palestinian territories. But does that make me a Nazi? No. Why? Because I don't hate Jews.
<BR>
In conclusion, your officemate isn't a Nazi, but your recent actions almost qualify you for one if only they were targeted at a Jew. Spying? Conspiring to get him fired? Sheesh. All for what? because you think he's a Nazi? Ignorance may be bliss but it won't get you anywhere. 
<BR>

<BR>
Christ, and you Americans even wonder why the rest of the world dislikes you so much..

Pretending that Ariel Sharon is one isolated right-wing hardliner may help you to pretend that the jews in Israel really are a lot like you, but it isn't a view with any basis in reality. Ariel Sharon is prime minister because that is what his people want. If you dislike his political views, then you dislike the views of the majority of Israelis. This does tend to indicate a certain amount of disaffection with the jewish people. You seem to be saying, "I like the jewish people, I just wish they were a different sort of people."

<BR>
From our correspondant in Tel Aviv.
<BR>

<BR>
Enlightened by some articles I had read on Adequacy, the one and only site for news for grown-ups, knowing that anybody opposed to Ariel Sharon's view was a Nazi, or a commie or whatever is the worst in the world at that very moment, I cast a brand new eye ( left the old one in the States) on the political scene. And it is very sad to say that there is in that blessed country a nest of the most dangerous nazis on earth.
<BR>

<BR>
The most dangerous? Would you ask. Yes, dear readers, the most dangerous, because they disguise as Israelis, as Jews. And in fact, most of them are Israelis and Jews.
<BR>

<BR>
Yahweh have mercy upon us! I couldn't believe my eyes (sorry I mean my eye, the brand new one), I couldn't believe my ears. Who would imagine, even  under the light (or the shadow?) of an historical precedent where we have seen a Jew betraying another one, and which one, for some change, who would imagine, dear readers, that Ariel Sharon could have an opposition?

To say, "If you don't hold my point of view, you obviously don't understand the situation," and then to leave it at that is the worst kind of cowardice.  Well, maybe not the worst kind.  Maybe not even the second- or third- worst kind -- but it is cowardice nonetheless.

<BR><BR>Oooh, it's all so <strong>complicated</strong>!  How complicated -- how <strong>convoluted</strong> a thought process do the facts have to go through before they are mangled into something that whitewashes Sharon?  Do you have to recite it, like catechism?

<BR><BR>All he said was that he disagreed with the actions of Sharon and the Israeli government.  From that you extrapolate that he's never considered Israel's point of view?  From that you extrapolate that he hates Jews?  Get over yourself.

<BR><BR>To answer the one point you did make:  Let's think about the creation of Israel.  The first Zionist Congress states that their goal is "to create for the Jewish people a home in Palestine."  They get their wish, carving Israel out of a predominantly Arab region.  Their Arab neighbours attacked.  Gee, I wonder:  If the Palestinians stated as their goal the creation of a Palestinian state in Palestine and tried to create such a state out of what is now Israel, would their Israeli neighbours attack?  Oh, wait, I forgot:  That's exactly what happened.  The difference is that Israel has had big supporters in both cases.

<BR><BR>Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians are innocent in this conflict.  They each have plenty of blood on their hands.

<BR><BR>Is "a workable understanding of the Israel/Palestine situation" any understanding that allows you to condemn the heinous actions of the Palestinians but endorse the heinous actions of the Israelis?

<BR><BR>In conclusion, I will now disavow my subject line.  There have been only two people in my life who I knew were Jewish, and they are both among the finest people I know.  I have never known any Jew I hated.  If you are Jewish, I can only assume that you intend to rectify that situation.  If you're not, I apologize to everyone that is for wondering whether you were.<BR>---<br>

<BR>
I would also like to expand on the claim that Israel "had big supporters in both situations." Let's not forget that in 1948, it was a damn miracle that Israel was recognized by the UN - in fact, the opposition was so overwhelming that the vote was expected by many to fail. 
<BR>

<BR>
Today, Israel's support (though big, I grant you) stems only from America. By contrast, it is hounded by a large number of inefficient and highly biased organizations composed partly of hate-mongers, partly of idiots who need a cause. The United Nations are a prime example. The Red Cross, which granted Palestine's request to recognize the Red Crescent on Palestinian ambulances, yet for years denies Israel a red six-ended star. The latter case is especially interesting, considering alleged Palestinian plans to use fake ambulances in suicide bombings. And of course, Canada, years ago a fine country but now run by cretins - a country that sometimes considers its only purpose to contradict the US and make as if it's economically and socially independent.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

My comments about Canada are only relevant as pertaining to the unfounded (in my opinion) hatred of the US.

<BR><BR>Anti-Semitism is prejudice against Semites, especially Jews; hatred of Jews would fall into this category.  Nazism and anti-Semitism are related only incidentally.  Nazism has more to do with fascism than it does with anti-Semitism, even looking in the context of history.  Some highly-placed Nazis (Adolph Hitler comes to mind) hated Jews, and because Nazism was so fascist, they were able to steer the course of an entire country to the extermination of the Jews.  There is no doubt in my mind that other Nazis were also anti-Semites; I'm sure there were many.  That does not mean that Nazism and anti-Semitism are one and the same thing.

<BR><BR>All that having been said, having a particular political opinion towards the actions of the Israeli government has more to do with Nazism, which is a political ism, than does anti-Semitism.  However, an evaluation of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict that is critical of the Israeli government's actions doesn't warrant the term Nazism.  In point of fact, I believe it warrants the term Nazism less than does an evaluation that is in favour of Israel's actions.<BR>---<br>

However, the political goal of the Israeli government is only the protection of its citizens, whereas the political goal of Arafat's government and Palestinian terrorist groups seems not only the creation of a state, but also the complete destruction of Israel.

The terrorists do not want peace -- otherwise, why would their attacks precede and/or follow nearly every major peace initiative? And if the "legitimate" Palestinian leadership wants peace, why wouldn't it accept the highly profitable Camp David accord, where the Israelis all but surrendered on all major points of dicussion?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

A few snippets from the piece:
<BR>

<BR>
"I waited until everybody left and then repositioned the webcam so that it looked in on his cubicle; this was tricky and required me to run wiring through the ceiling tiles, but the result is that I can constantly surveil this man and make sure that he is not participating in such activities as reading Mein Kampf or meeting with officials of the German government. "
<BR>

<BR>
"My wife and I have decided to take turns watching his house. She takes the day shift, while I'm at work; she tirelessly watches their property in our minivan with our two children. She has claimed to have seen a Nazi flag hanging on his living room wall during the brief moments that his front door is open, though she admits that this might be a Rusty Wallace poster. I watch his house at night. Several times I have seen unknown persons go into his residence; how am I to know if these people are not officials from the German or Soviet governments?"
<BR>

<BR>
This guy is serious?  Riiight.  
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, there are many idiots on the internet, and yes, sometimes they hold convictions that may be hard for a "normal" human to believe.  But what we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is humor at its purest.  To those who think it might even begin to be otherwise I would suggest to pray that they fall into category (a).
<BR>

<BR>
&gt;Wouldn't it be ironic that a website that 
<BR>
&gt;purportedly gives "news for grown-ups" puts, on 
<BR>
&gt;its frontpage nonetheless, a joke? 
<BR>

<BR>
It's ironic that most people claiming to be adults took the above literally as a child would.  It's not only funny, it also has a not-so-hidden message that any self-proclaimed "adult" should be able to see.  IMHO.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

what worries me is that some people take the article seriously, either reacting to it so violently or following up on certain strains of its logic.  lighten up people, and take a look at multiple facets of the Israel/Palestine conflict.  look at the history and the religions involved, from multiple perspectives.  don't make judgments based entirely on what you hear in the news, unless you read a wide variety of news publications.  try to get something resembling legitimate information--this is basically what most people are lacking, the facts.  the rest just lack reason.

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;p&gt;what's tragic about the Middle East conflict is that there are no easy solutions, but both sides have long thought differently.  Extremists of both Israeli and Islamic stripes have long seen the obliteration of the problem--people unlike themselves--as the only solution. &lt;/p&gt;

My bowel-directed threats simply reflect my resentment that what seems to be the main focus of this article (the piece referred to as satirical, for your understanding) is to introduce more anti-Israeli fabrications -- to use the humorous form, which I respect and enjoy, to escape the responsibility of objectively evaluating the situation. This is not mere humour -- it's sick propaganda.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Well, my friend, all you have to do is look at the promised land today.  Islamists and Arabics want to integrate Israel, not realizing -- or not caring -- that doing so would make the Jews a minority in their own country.  For what are the Jews without their racial purity, untainted by the greasy savagery of Earth's browner folk?  
<BR>

<BR>
No, Yassir Aerofat and his terrorist ilk truly are indeed directly and obviously perpetuating racial tragedy.  Every settler family killed is an act of racist oppression.  Bank on it.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Not to mention that the Arabics, of course, hold a near-monopoly on the world's oil supply.  This makes them a shifty, wealthy class of semites, with a shadowy religious conspiracy that reaches worldwide (Al Qaeba) and the end goal of reclaiming Zion.  
<BR>

<BR>
Indeed, a more apt name for "Al Qaeda" would be "The Worldwide Zionist Conspiracy."  I suggeset that all supporters of the Jewish people should promote the use of that term.  It will help clarify the evil of the Arab cause, and will thus aid the Jews' cause to live in a world without defamation.

<BR><BR>thanks.  you may not be aware of this, but there are urban areas in Ky, that is, we're not all "backwoods folk."  but as far as that goes, racism is not the same thing as cultural prejudice--i.e., racism assumes divergent <i>genetic</i> backgrounds, which most people wouldn't ascribe to Kentuckians.  except for the legendary "Blue People of Kentucky," who are historically so inbred that they have blue skin.

<BR><BR>the only real solution to the world's racial conflicts is that everybody fuck everybody else, trying as hard as possible not to match one's own race to that of one's (many) partner(s).  I'm neither Jewish nor Arabic nor of any particular race beyond Anglo-Saxon, I couldn't give a flying hoot about the Jews and their purity.  not that any rational Jew, Arab, or Anglo cares either.

<BR>

<BR>
Good Lord!  Of course not.  Israel is predicated on racism no more than any other nation that expels those of a specific race in order to create a majority of another race is.  Ethnic cleansing, most empatically, *is* *not* *racism*.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt; Lots of those nations hate the Jews and want to 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Exactly.  In the real world, social change cannot occur; Germans, Russians, and such-like are overwhelmingly incapable of growth as humans.  This necessarily justifies not only moving to a Land Without a People, but cleansing that land of the people that do happen to be there (but not really.)  If the Israeli army needs to kill a few children, any rational observer can see that it does so to promote human rights.
<BR>

<BR>
I think we both support the state of Israel and what it's doing; we just have a difference of wording.  :)  We both yearn for a final solution to Arab opression of the Jewish race.  Can't we be friends?

That's right, old timer -- hence the phrase "predicated on."  See, when a man and a woman love something very much, they think about it in their brains.  This is called a "concept."  Sometimes things that people do in the world are thought about beforehand, and these actions are based on certain assumptions -- kinds of "concepts" -- called "predicates."

<BR>

<BR>
Nor did I!  This has nothing to do with colonialism.  Sharon's good work in solving the Muslim Problem is no worse than, say, the extermination of Muslims in the former Yugoslavia.  In both cases, it's helping to end the International Zionist Conspiracy (Al Qaedu); neither has to do with Colonialism.  Both cleansings are thus justifiable.

<BR>

Most wholeheartedly agreed!  History has proven that passive resistance will never work.  Only through guerilla warfare and collective punishment is lasting peace acheived.
<BR>

<BR>
&gt; The only difference between these exiles and the 
<BR>
&gt; Palestinians is that, unlike the Arabs with the 
<BR>
&gt; Palestinians, the middle-eastern Jews had 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Again, it's like you're reading my mind.  *I'm on your side.* It is the G.d-given duty of TruJews to guard their majority in Israel.  And you're right -- it's not like other countries fail to do unsavory things to innocent Jews.  Knowing the culture of Palestinians, it's inevitable that they'll grow up to be killers.  (We have the same problem with Negroes here in the States.)
<BR>

<BR>
Seriously, you're right on the money here.  Keep fighting the good fight!

It is intended to fly in the face of consensus reality and <em>offend</em> us.  Holding the article to a higher standard would completely emasculate it and run counter to its purpose.

<BR><BR>That is what satire <em>is</em>.  I don't suppose the Londoners of Swift's time enjoyed being identified as tantamount to baby eaters.  <i>A Modest Proposal</i> is so well-known today to be almost cliche, but I have no doubt that it had a much greater and more visceral impact at the time it was written.  Swift's essay could very easily have had its own critics disclaiming any value it might have had by calling it nonsensical.

<BR><BR>The article, and satire in general, is intended to inflame controversy, not assuage it.  If satire is restricted to safe topics, then satire has lost its value, and in fact has ceased to be.

<BR><BR>As for the article being nothing more than a load of bull, let's think about that for a moment.  The discussion prompted by the article focuses on the Israeli / Palestinian conflict.   That discussion is certainly valuable in its own right.  However, the real issues presented in the article have passed virtually unremarked-upon.  In my opinion, Israelis, Palestinians, anti-Semites, and Nazis are all incidental to the point the article is trying to make.  After all, he didn't ask, "What should be done about the Israeli / Palestinian conflict."  He asked, "How do I deal with Nazis in the workplace?"

<BR><BR>That's the serious answer, such as it is.

<BR><BR>I think Adequacy is brilliant and profane.  In a free society there can be no sacred cows.  On the other hand, sometimes, it's just funny to say the word 'heiffer'.<BR>---<br>

<BR><BR>true enough, but the ultimate effect of the article is of brass sarcasm.  There's nothing expressed that the author hasn't <a href="./2001.11.20.131313.36.html">already</a>.

<BR><BR>ultimately I liked the article simply because I was so thoroughly offended by it--it sparks a debate and arouses a few questions that all of us ought to be asking.  (I hadn't read the previous article.)  

<BR><BR>but the power of irony lies in its more traditional conception: to teach by arguing a viewpoint <i>opposite</i> or <i>contradictory</i> to one's goal.  that viewpoint is argued in such a way as to exaggerate the viewpoint's faults; the outcome is ideally an understanding of multiple sides of the issue and an opinion one way or another.  generally Socrates is the most well-known proponent of this kind of irony.  

<BR><BR><i>After all, he didn't ask, "What should be done about the Israeli / Palestinian conflict." He asked, "How do I deal with Nazis in the workplace?" </i>

<BR><BR>there is irony in the article in the sense that the author wants to exaggerate himself as a totalitarian, shitty employer--because he may well try hard not to be a shitty employer or manager.  And the article plays on popular sensitivities about "Nazism"--but he's already done both of these. 

<BR><BR>the author's a hack, and adequacy is at fault for letting him recycle his stories. the "workplace" and the "-ism" jokes were already done.  he did well enough as far as inflaming controversy, but in large part by placing the burden on the reader to argue against a viewpoint (presumably pro-Israel) that was never even clarified positively or negatively.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Inevitably, there will be people who misconstrue the intent of a satirical work and will read nothing more into it than what the words say.  The risk is greater when the subject matter is so controversial and there are extremes of thought on either side.  However, I think the value is greater in that circumstance, too.

<BR><BR>Re-reading the article, I don't see how it could be reasonably viewed as hateful propaganda.  Israel is a political entity, and the controversial actions it is taking are political actions.  The actions may certainly be motivated by religious factors, but the political argument against them grows stronger to the extent that that is true.

<BR><BR>I find little propaganda in the article, but there is some.  It does suggest, for example, that pregnant women are being denied medical care.  That can certainly be considered propaganda, especially if it is false, but I don't think it can be considered hateful unless it is motivated by hate and intended to engender hate.  I don't think either is true.

<BR><BR>I'm not going to defend the quality of the article because I've seen much better elsewhere.  I don't think balance is what it needs to improve it, though.  In fact, I think balancing the article would only serve to make it worse.<BR>---<br>

Frankly, it's laughable.
<BR>

<BR>
The reality is that a huge number of Jews in Israel are against the illegal land-grabbing occupationists.

One only need read Israel's most popular newspaper paper, the "Haartz Daily" to realize that those in favor of "purging" most of the indigenous population by force, to get their land, are thought of as despicable.

Now, you want "support" for my "hateful paranoid conspiracy-theorist delusions?"  Since you obviosly don't read the newspaper, I'll quote from an article by Dafna Linzer, of the 
<BR>
Associated Press in the Washington Post from two months ago, as the movement was getting started:
<BR>

<BR>
 "Today, they are a group of 460 Israeli men, mostly officers, from different backgrounds who formulated a common opposition to Israel's presence in the territories - home to some 3 million Palestinians and more than 200,000 Jewish settlers."
<BR>

<BR>
They all refuse to serve.  If you want me to paste or email you the whole article, I will.  
<BR>

<BR>
Try looking in the mirror the next time you accuse anyone who faults you for supporting state-funded hatred by calling them anti-Jewish.  It really makes you look stupid.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The fact that we hear about dissenting Israelis is a credit to Israel more than anything. Know why we don't hear anything about Palestinians protesting Arafat and his terrorist cronies?

<BR>
It really makes you look stupid, and confirms that you don't have an argument.
<BR>

<BR>
Many Americans believe that Ted Kennedy, George Bush, and Hillary Clinton have no right (constitutionally or otherwise) to take our money and send it to Sharon's racists in Israel.
<BR>

<BR>
"Liberals" and "Conservatives" alike in Congress may be equally willing to give American tax dollars away to support the racist thugs in Israel that are committing their crimes... as long as Sharon backers continue to keep up their lobbying kick-backs, that is.
<BR>

<BR>
One only need to go the AIPAC's website to see that they boast about being one of the most powerful lobbyist groups in Washington.
<BR>

<BR>
In fact, they are more powerful than the oil and steel lobbyists.  In other words (to make it simple for you Mudillo) they pay our politicians *lots* of money.  Are you going to deny this?
<BR>

<BR>
Fortunately, a large population of Jews in Israel are against the USA pumping money to those Likud scumbags.  Americans are finally standing up against support of Sharon's terrorists as well, even in the face of people like you threatening to character assassinate them.
<BR>

<BR>
Again, don't try to change the subject by attacking the moral qualities of the Palestinian regime.  No one here is calling for our tax money to go to them, and you know it, but needless to say, you are clearly desperate for anything to support your argument.

Don't hide behind your idiotic and worn out propaganda -- admit the truth.

You hate America and are pissed that concerned citizens here, and all over the world are calling for an end to people like you demanding we give our hard-earned cash to Sharon's land-grabbing, hate-mongering scum-bags.

Simply because the latter accomplishes it with terror doesn't mean it's not the same thing. My vocabulary choice, meanwhile, is something I stand by. I have no other words for someone like you -- a hatemonger hiding behind one-sided half-truths.
<BR>

<BR>
As for AIPAC -- direct me to some credible statistics that show that it is more powerful and the oil and steel lobbyists (obviously AIPAC's "boasting" doesn't count). I can't claim to disprove these statements, but I do find them a little hard to believe.
<BR>

<BR>
In the meantime -- where, pray tell, is the opposition to residents of the US and Canada pumping money to Hamas and similar terrorist organizations? It's nearly universal knowledge that this takes place on a continuous basis. Shouldn't that be at least as big a concern as support for Israel?
<BR>

<BR>
The moral quality of the Palestinian regime is directly relevant to this debate. Discussing it does not consitute a red herring, but attempting to suppress such discussion does. I hear you screaming and raving about "Sharon's terrorists" and "Likud scumbags" as if they are the only ones to blame for the current situation. Moreover, you know full well that Sharon gained power because Israelis simply didn't know who to turn to after all their offers of peace were met with more carnage.
<BR>

<BR>
And finally, stop deluding yourself and others. America sends money to Israel because, as a characteristic superpower, it wants a foothold in the Middle East and Israel is its only choice.

<BR>

<BR>
http://www.aipac.org/documents/whoweare.html
<BR>

<BR>
Or maybe the website has been hacked by a band of evil "hatemongering" hackers, and your disbelief of my statement about the lobby is correct?  Could the website be a tampered document!??  I think you're onto something.
<BR>

<BR>
Since you seem to disbelieve the AIPAC's website, here is the link to Fortune magazine's list of top 25 most powerful lobbyist groups. You'll see the AIPAC right up near the top, at number four.
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.fortune.com/lists/power25/index.html
<BR>

<BR>
Oh yeah, foolish me, "Fortune" magazine must also be in on the massive "hatemongering" campaign to stop Sharon's gang from their charitable pursuits.  Lucky we have you around to point these racists out to us.  *Phew*
<BR>

<BR>
In my opinion (that of a "hatemonger,") if you want to keep sending your personal money to Sharon's state-funded terrorists, that is up to you.  If people in Canada or the USA want to send their personal money to Sharon or the extremists that oppose Sharon, that is up to them.
<BR>

<BR>
The bottom line is "don't demand me to send my money to either group."  Americans should be free to send their money to anyone they please, just not by force through our taxes.  I know that sounds radical to you, and that anyone who agrees must clearly be a "hatemonger" and a "racist."
<BR>

<BR>
You may send Sharon all your earnings for all I care.  You state that he is the logical answer to Israel's problems because "Israelis simply didn't know who to turn to after all their offers of peace were met with more carnage."  
<BR>

<BR>
By your definition would the slaughter of over 800 civilian men, women and children by forces under his command in 1982 when he was Defense Minister constitute "carnage?"
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/26062002-112406-2777r.htm
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Since you "stand by" your use of the term "Sharon's ethnic cleansing" by stating that he does it without "terror," do you think the women and children he kills, instead of experiencing "terror" as they die, are comforted in their last breaths by the thought that they are sacrificing their lives for the benevolent Likud party?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Or is this just part of the Global hatemongering plan of world-wide press to overthrow the saintly Sharon and his merry band of peace-makers?
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps there is some truth to your claim that politicians send billions of our tax dollars to Sharon as an attempt to gain a "foothold" in that region of the world.
<BR>

<BR>
As Thomas Jefferson put it, "Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none." 
<BR>

<BR>
America is the largest consumer of oil in the world.  The wealth of the Middle-East economy is dependent on us.  Those countries compete for our business, and we are naturally placed in the category of "VIP customer."
<BR>

<BR>
Giving Sharon and his thugs gun money to kill kids and bulldoze neighborhoods will not ensure good will with the people of the Middle-East.
<BR>

<BR>
You may scoff at Americans and others who stand up against this Sharon's scam, but people are starting to take notice, and the politicians are becoming more likely to fall in line with the wishes of their constituency, over that of lobbyist-bribes.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you should try to stop accusing everyone who opposes Sharon's state-funded murdering and land-grabbing of being "hatemongers" and try something a little more rational.  This is the 3rd time I've said this, but that tactic of defending Sharon is way stale, and really makes you look stupid.
<BR>

<BR>
Try supporting the masses of Jews in Israel that are calling for an end to the expansion of the illegal settlements.
<BR>

<BR>
Try supporting the approximately 500 hundred Israeli soldiers who have chosen honor and dignity, at the risk of prison, over the choice of playing hired gun for Sharon's land-grab.
<BR>

<BR>
Try supporting the Jews of Israel that will die at the hands of Palestinian suicide bombers in retaliation attacks everytime the Likud party sends soldiers with bull-dozers to wipe out an ancient neighborhood, kick out all non-Jews, and put up a settlement.
<BR>

<BR>
Try supporting Americans who are calling to an end for tax money to be sent to extremists on either side of the issue.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Just to set the record straight, let's not rephrase my words for me, shall we? Do not attribute my calling you a hatemonger to AIPAC, nor imply that I somehow misrepresented their status as a lobbyist group. Do not speak for me things I never said -- such as the statement that Sharon's election was a "logical" solution (I believe that it was an act of desperation). Unless you are under the impression that it helps your credibility -- in that case, continue, as you need all the help you can get.
<BR>

<BR>
Where *do* Americans want to send their hard-earned cash? Chances are, back to their pockets, not to some strategic interest hell-knows-where. In that case, perhaps there's a little flaw with your system of government, your world position as a superpower, and your desire to control the destiny of the world. I personally have no objection to America as the global gendarme, since it supports a way of life that I accept (inasmuch as it is the lesser evil of the many, at least). You, however, seem at odds with your own government -- take it up with them. Do not place the blame for US support on AIPAC alone. Or, perhaps the all-powerful Free Masons are behind this?
<BR>

<BR>
Your understatement of "some truth" in American strategic interests won't help you. America wants oil, America wants to get its hands on Iraq. There is a lot of truth here. And I hardly think that "good will with the people of the Middle East" is any more than a useless buzzword after Sept. 11 and Afganistan. The majority of the Middle East despises America and you know it.
<BR>

<BR>
The killing of 800 Palestinians was, as in the article you linked, accomplished by Lebanese militia allied with Sharon. I call you a hatemonger because your use of such terms as "Sharon's terrorists" will be attributed instead to all Jews, already hounded around the world (even if this was not your intent, though I'm inclined to believe it was).
<BR>

<BR>
My opinion of you as a hatemonger is only strengthened by your failure to address the faults of Palestinian government and its terror campaign. Speaking of "retaliation" for Likud actions has lost all meaning. If we descend into the endless chain of retaliations, why not start in 1948 when Arab nations descended upon Israel the instant it was recognized by the UN? I seem to recall the slaughter of far more innocent Israelis (yes, women and children, sometimes entire settlements) during and since that time.
<BR>

<BR>
You again present a corrupt, skewed view of the issue. So maybe terrorist attacks occur only when a new neighbourhood is bulldozed? I don't recall reading about new settlements in the past little while, but where's the decline in suicide bombings?
<BR>

<BR>
Do not make as if Israel would have peace handed to it on a silver platter the instant they stopped building settlements and performing military incursions. It is perfectly clear that Palestinian terrorist factions have as their only goal the complete destruction of Israel, not peace.
<BR>

<BR>
You will, I suppose, again accuse me of "changing the subject," and again I will say that this IS the subject. Israel is no more the aggressor that the Palestinians; in the past while, it is the Palestinians who have been on an unrelenting offensive. If American money flows there at all, it should flow to Israel.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
So I did.
<BR>

<BR>
You said,
<BR>

<BR>
"Moreover, you know full well that Sharon gained power because Israelis simply didn't know who to turn to after all their offers of peace were met with more carnage."

Sounds like you thought the choice of Sharon was pretty logical to me?

"You, however, seem at odds with your own government -- take it up with them. Do not place the blame for US support on AIPAC alone. Or, perhaps the all-powerful Free Masons are behind this?"
<BR>

<BR>
FWIW, I've mailed my congressmen with my concerns.  Thanks for the advice.  I'm not familiar with the "Free Masons" though. Are they part of the massive global conspiracy against the benevolent Sharon and his warm and fuzzy "Likud Party" that you keep harping, er, I mean discussing?
<BR>

<BR>
I will agree with you that "there's a little flaw with our system of government." Our foreign policy is anti-American, anti-Constitutional, anti-Middle East and gives cause for the "majority of the Middle East" to despise us. 
<BR>

<BR>
This is precisely why I am against politicians answering to oil lobbies and pro-Sharon lobbies(AIPAC), or any other lobby groups, instead of answering to the safety and well-being of the American people, and to the safety and well-being of people the world over.
<BR>

<BR>
You take offense, and "are inclined to think" I'm a "hatemonger" because I used the phrase "Sharon's terrorists."
<BR>

<BR>
From the American Heritage Dictionary:
<BR>

<BR>
ter�ror�ism   Pronunciation Key  (tr-rzm) n. 
<BR>

<BR>
The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons.
<BR>

<BR>
Feel better now?  If you are going to say that anyone who despises Sharon for his terrorist actions is guilty of calling all Jews around the world terrorists, you certainly need help.
<BR>

<BR>
*Sigh*  You say, 
<BR>

<BR>
"I don't recall reading about new settlements in the past little while, but where's the decline in suicide bombings?"
<BR>

<BR>
Since the election of Sharon in Feb. of 2001, 34 new settlements have been established.  
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Or are the Labor Party and the peace movement "Peace Now" in Israel "hatemonger" organizations too?
<BR>

<BR>
If you want to "descend into the endless chain of retaliations" let's descend to the years preceding the 1948 War of Independence (between 1939 and 1945) and examine the terrorist acts of Zionist leaders in Palestine.
<BR>

<BR>
There was the Haganah headed by Ben Gurion, the Irgun Z'vai Leumi headed by Menachem Begin, and the Stern Gang headed by Yitzhak Shamir.  All specialized in inventing and committing a wide range of terrorism towards the British and towards non-Jewish civilians. 
<BR>

<BR>
Israeli leaders are the Godfathers of terrorism in Palestine and in the Middle East.  I'll send you several links describing details if you don't want to research it yourself.
<BR>

<BR>
You say,
<BR>

<BR>
"Do not make as if Israel would have peace handed to it on a silver platter the instant they stopped building settlements and performing military incursions."
<BR>

<BR>
Well, it would be a good place to start.  Israel has decided to have two sets of laws in the territory it controls.  I will support any solution that recognizes that all people have
<BR>
equal rights regardless of ethnicity/religion.
<BR>

<BR>
*Hrmm, I wonder if that "equal rights" idea is going to make me more of a "hatemonger?"*<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Your anti-American foreign policy, my dimwitted friend, is what promotes your American way of life. Let's see just how long America remains a successful and rich superpower when it starts practicing an isolationist rather than a heartland-hinterland relationship with less wealthy nations. "Safety and well-being of the world over" -- how nice and peachy. I suggest you learn a little more about the world economy before trying to rework it through your congressman (was it Traficant?).
<BR>

<BR>
Dictionary definitions -- now you're just grasping at straws. You know perfectly well the world doesn't run to the dictionary every time it sees a controversial phrase, and that the term "Sharon's terrorists" is much more likely to be interpreted against Jews. If you are truly so naive, you need professional help; if, as I suspect, you are pushing your hateful little propaganda, then you need euthanasia.

Once again a completely useless point -- not only were Zionist actions directed at the British, but it is a fact that Palestinians instigated riots and pogroms against Jews; the Haganah you speak of was formed as a self-defense movement. 1939-45? How about 1920, 1921, and 1929, when such events took place? How about the 1936 revolt where hundreds of Jews *and* Arabs opposed to the instigators were killed? Take your historical revisionism elsewhere.
<BR>

<BR>
Israel has two sets of laws now? How about Palestinians, with no laws at all? In light of the recent university bombing, the question of who really is the terrorist has once again been bloodily answered. I don't feel the need to seriously address your idiocy and hate any longer. Your half-truths, equivocations, and baseless conclusions do a poor job of hiding your hatred of Jews.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
You've thrown the terms "hatemonger" and "hateful" at me so many times in your recent posts (against my advice that it makes you look ignorant and hypocritical) that it's tough to keep track of why you've haphazardly thrown these terms out each time.
<BR>

<BR>
Regardless, to refresh your memory a second time, you said,
<BR>

"As for AIPAC -- direct me to some credible statistics that show that it is more powerful and the oil and steel lobbyists. I can't claim to disprove these statements, but I do find them a little hard to believe."

You prefaced that statement with, 
<BR>

<BR>
"I have no other words for someone like you -- a hatemonger hiding behind one-sided half-truths."
<BR>

<BR>
Sounds like you were "insinuating" that I was a "hatemonger" for telling a "half-truth?"
<BR>

<BR>
I showed you that your "disbelief" was unfounded, and that labeling me a "hatemonger" based upon your belief that I was "hiding behind one-sided half-truths" was inappropriate.
<BR>

<BR>
Instead of apologizing for your mistake, you continued to throw out the term "hatemonger," which is only cheapened when spouted from the mouths of hypocrites who don't understand the term.

<BR>
You said,
<BR>

<BR>
"Your anti-American foreign policy, my dimwitted friend, is what promotes your American way of life."
<BR>

<BR>
Doesn't that contradict your statement "The majority of the Middle East despises America and you know it?"  Making the Middle East despise us with a biased, anti-Constitutional foreign policy promotes the American way of life?
<BR>

<BR>
Wow.  You are all over the place.
<BR>

<BR>
I'll repeat a quote from one of the most influential creators of the American Constitution (which outlines government foreign policy), Thomas Jefferson, 
<BR>

<BR>
"Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none." 
<BR>

<BR>
That's anti-American?  
<BR>

<BR>
I tend to think that Jefferson's policy, as opposed to the present policy of illegally sending tax-payers money to regimes chosen by the most influential lobbyist groups, is a bit more "American," don't you?  
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe I'm wrong, and revenge attacks by dissidents reacting to our politician's reckless gifting of money, training and arms to random countries on lobbyists orders, such as occurred on 9/11, are actually good for our economy.  You must know something I don't?
<BR>

<BR>
Oh my goodness, you said,
<BR>

<BR>
"You know perfectly well the world doesn't run to the dictionary every time it sees a controversial phrase, and that the term "Sharon's terrorists" is much more likely to be interpreted against Jews."
<BR>

<BR>
So you really do believe that anyone who calls Sharon and his thugs "terrorists" is committing a moral crime, because it is "likely to be interpreted" as "all Jews are terrorists."  
<BR>

<BR>
Then you said, acting upon your "suspicion" that the reason I used the term was not due to the facts I've presented, but that (once again), I am pushing "hateful propaganda,"  and that I should be "euthanized."  
<BR>

<BR>
You have finally, clearly, without a doubt, shown that it is you who is the "hatemonger."  A sick, twisted, malicious, contemptible person who accuses others of what you yourself undoubtedly are.  
<BR>

<BR>
Free speech is dead by your rules, and anyone you "suspect" of speaking "hateful propaganda" (which you've proven to be a massive, arbitrary population of people) deserve nothing less than to be round up and murdered.  
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps you can make a list of unspeakable "controversial phrases?"
<BR>

<BR>
Well, you are a good fit for Sharon's Gestapo.  You would do well to move to Israel, join his secret police, and round up, kill (or "euthanize") all the Palestinians you can.
<BR>

<BR>
You will be pleased to find that you can detain them, torture them and even kill them with nothing other than your unbiased, unfaltering "suspicions" to back you up.  
<BR>

<BR>
Also, while you're at it, make a list of the tens of thousands of Israelis who protest against "Sharon's terrorists."  
<BR>

<BR>
*Sigh*  You said,

<BR>
"It has been some year and a half since February 2001. I am referring to, oh say, the last 2-3 months of NON-STOP TERRORISM WITHOUT ANY NEW SETTLEMENTS BEING ESTABLISHED... hmm."
<BR>

<BR>
The all-caps is a nice touch, but I guess I have to spell it out for you.  "Since the election of Sharon in Feb. of 2001, 34 new settlements have been established," does not mean that the 34 settlements were built exclusively on or before Feb. 2001.  
<BR>

<BR>
It means they were built between that date and now...  Get it?  That time period includes the last 2-3 months.  I know, subtraction is tough.
<BR>

<BR>
You said, 
<BR>

<BR>
"Once again a completely useless point -- not only were Zionist actions directed at the British, but it is a fact that Palestinians instigated riots and pogroms against Jews; the Haganah you speak of was formed as a self-defense movement."
<BR>

<BR>
A useless point huh?  Yeah, you're right, the following info has been well-documented, but the Haganah was merely a noble "self-defense movement," not a *gasp,* militant group of thugs guilty of countless war crimes.
<BR>

<BR>
From, http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/arab-israeli-war.html
<BR>

<BR>
"The Haganah, and subsequently the IDF, overran large Arab-populated areas--some four hundred villages and towns--whereas Arab forces conquered or overran fewer than a dozen Jewish settlements in the course of the war.
<BR>
     In retrospect, it is clear that what occurred in 1948 in Palestine was a variety of ethnic cleansing of Arab areas by Jews. It is impossible to say how many of the 700,000 or so Palestinians who became refugees in 1948 were physically expelled, as distinct from simply fleeing a combat zone. What is certain is that almost all were barred by the Israeli government decision of June 1948 and, consequently, by IDF fire, from returning to their homes or areas. Similarly, almost all of the four hundred 
<BR>
or so Arab villages overrun and depopulated by Israel were in the course of 1948 or immediately thereafter razed to the ground, partly in order to prevent the refugees from returning."
<BR>

<BR>
Take your historical revisionism elsewhere.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't feel the need to seriously address your idiocy and hate any longer.  Your half-truths, equivocations, and baseless conclusions do a poor job of hiding your hatred of Jews, and your hatred of anyone else opposed to state-funded terror.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Take a deep breath Mudillo, then attempt to explain what these two phrases mean, 
<BR>

<BR>
"Not in the least. American material success at home doesn't really come from nowhere, does it?"
<BR>

<BR>
After that logical and grammatical car-crash, you said, 
<BR>

<BR>
"I repeat, check on the way economy works before making yourself look stupid again."  I appreciated the laughs, but please stop hogging all my opportunities to reveal you as the fool you are.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, after trying to decipher the meaning of the phrase "American material success at home doesn't really come from nowhere, does it?" I was forced to hazard a guess and presume that you are implying that American "material wealth" comes in part from supporting Sharon.
<BR>

<BR>
How supporting Sharon leads to "material wealth" in America is beyond me.  Again, I can see how it may have led to 9/11, but that didn't exactly get our economy rolling did it?
<BR>

<BR>
I had pointed this out to you already, but perhaps the synapses misfired again, and it slipped from your memory and/or you forgot to "check on the way economy works" yesterday.  
<BR>

<BR>
Tell me what your reference is when you "check on the way economy works," then get back to me.
<BR>

<BR>
You said, 
<BR>

<BR>
"You are assuming more than I, for my assumption is based on the fact that new "illegal" settlements have not received *any* attention in *any* media source in the recent period I referred to, which is certainly different from a year ago (when these settlements were probably at the peak of construction)."
<BR>

<BR>
My advice for you is to do a minimal amount of research before blurting out ignorant statements. Maybe even read a newspaper now and then.

Israel approves expanding settlements 
<BR>
By Hazel Ward
<BR>
AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE
<BR>

<BR>
     JERUSALEM -- The Israeli government agreed yesterday to build nearly 1,000 houses in Jewish settlements near Jerusalem, sparking protests from Israeli peace groups and Palestinian officials."
<BR>

<BR>
It took me one minute to find this.  Looks like the charitable Likuds hadn't quite "completed their construction" a year ago at all. Your laziness, coupled with the hypocrisy of your accusations is astounding. 
<BR>

<BR>
One must admire your tenacity to never let the facts stand in the way of your hateful agenda.
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps we should just agree to disagree at this point. We'll never see eye to eye.
<BR>

<BR>
You've expressed that you would murder (or "euthanize" as you put it) anyone who publicly attacks Sharon by referring to his regime as "Sharon's terrorists."  
<BR>

<BR>
If you controlled the universe (under "Mudillo's Ministry of Information" I suppose), using the phrase "Sharon's terrorists," based upon your *extremely* broad "suspicions," could be defined as "hateful little propaganda" and punishable by death.  
<BR>

<BR>
Hitler would have done well with a pupil like you by his side doling out that special kind of justice that you speak so highly of.
<BR>

<BR>
It was an appropriate way to demonstrate to all the true meaning behind the word "hatemonger" that you misuse so often.
<BR>

<BR>
In the future, I also recommend obtaining a vocabulary of your own, and perhaps a little extra points of IQ would help. Or, in your case, a lot.

I've twice quoted the foreign policy I support, so eloquently spoken by Thomas Jefferson.  Implying that I support an isolationist foreign policy shows that you a either ignorant or deceitful (don't worry, I don't want you euthanized for either).
<BR>

You said,

<BR>
"Here I note that, aside from a poor understanding of real grammar, you seem to have an obsession with Sharon, attributing all of my comments to him. Perhaps this is a sexual attraction?"

<BR>
Where shall I start?  
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks for pointing out my poor grammar, but isn't that really just more sour grapes?
<BR>

<BR>
You point out *my* obsession with Sharon, after, on several occasions, you have *rabidly* attacked me for criticizing him.
<BR>

<BR>
Then you pull that odd "sexual attraction" question out of left field.  If this is not a clear case of someone projecting their own hidden thoughts upon a stranger, then I don't know what is.  Can anyone say "Freudian slip?"
<BR>

<BR>
You said, 
<BR>

<BR>
"if, as I suspect, you are pushing your hateful little propaganda, then you need euthanasia."
<BR>

<BR>
How dare I presume that you would be willing to murder *everyone* you "suspected" of pushing "hateful little propaganda," instead of only me.
<BR>

<BR>
I guess I jumped to conclusions when I deduced from your psychotic and hateful statement, that you were an equal-opportunity "euthanizer."
<BR>

<BR>
You said,
<BR>

<BR>
"I could say that "houses in Jewish settlements" is not really the same as "new settlements," 
<BR>

<BR>
You could say that, but we both know (because I've educated you) that under Sharon, 34 new settlements have gone up, and that the construction of these was not halted 2-3 months ago, as you tried to profess.

<BR>
Al-Ittihad's Monday edition reported that the government had approved in its meeting on Sunday the establishment of 14 new Jewish compounds in the Galilee and the Negev. Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon said: "it is a national need, and establishing new towns is aimed to ensure land for the next generation; and if we don't live on this land others will !!.

The newspapers also revealed that the 14 compounds are the first stage of a project, which will include 60 compounds in different places, and every one will include 200-500 apartments."

Why, maybe they even stage suicide bombings to frame the Palestinian angels!!!

You're a nut-job, and I love nut-jobs.  Some of my best friends are *special* people.  
<BR>

<BR>
Unfortunately, even though you and I are friends now, I can only do so much for you.
<BR>

<BR>
We've had the "lazy" talk, and I don't want to nag, but I did put the websites in front of you once before didn't I?  
<BR>

<BR>
Now, I warned you about blurting angry things out before you do a little research didn't I?  Clicking on the links I sent you wouldn't have been too hard now would it have?
<BR>

<BR>
At this point, you have to help yourself.  
<BR>

<BR>
Both links to the settlements pages, one estimating 34 (not "36") and the other estimating 44, came from the *same* "Peace Now" website, but from articles written at different times of the year.
<BR>

<BR>
Here they are again -
<BR>

<BR>
The first link is from March 19, 2002.
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.peacenow.org.il/English.asp?Redirect=4&CategoryID=45&ReportID=236
<BR>

<BR>
and
<BR>

<BR>
The second link is from June 29, 2002:
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.peacenow.org/shalomachshav/settlements0602.html
<BR>

<BR>
This means, in the year 2002, between March 3rd and June 29th, 10 new settlements were established, that's all.  
<BR>

<BR>
Go ahead, click on them yourself.  That-a-boy.  See.  Feel better sport?
<BR>

<BR>
You said, 
<BR>

<BR>
"Well, forgive, me I was SO wrong. Evidently such objective sources as these and the "Digital Intifada" and Hamas websites (which you'll cite next, I expect) are 100% correct. Gee, I guess I'll also have to believe that the Holocaust never happened, and that Palestine was a land of milk and honey before the Jews came..."
<BR>

<BR>
Your mind is in the bad place now.  Come back.  Let's go to the good places again?  Good boy.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, "Peace Now" is not affiliated in any way with "Hamas Websites," or the "Digital Intifada" websites.  These are just bad tricks in your head right now.  They will pass.  
<BR>

<BR>
I want you to stay away from filing your head with the ramblings that fill up the last three paragraphs of your post.  Remember our "grounding exercises" when you start to slip.
<BR>

<BR>
Some sites I want you to go to:
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.btselem.org
<BR>
http://www.gush-shalom.org/
<BR>
http://www.peacenow.org/
<BR>
www.haaretzdaily.com
<BR>
www.lp.org
<BR>

<BR>
We don't want you going anywhere that brings on the "euthanize" voice, now do we?

Why do people continue to invoke Naziism as though it were some special nastyness ? Humans have been killing each other and taking each others land for thousands and thousands of years, and yet the unfortunate Nazis seem to get put in a special category of evil. Admittedly they used the techniques of mass production to create the holocaust, but the Armenian genocide by the Turks was on a similar scale, and Stalin's treatment of the Kulaks was not much better.<BR><BR>
I have said it before and I will say it again. Murdering innocent people is wrong. It does not matter if you are a Jew, a Nazi, an American pilot in Afghanistan or what. Just stop killing innocent people. In the words of Rodney King "can't we all just get along ?"

Naziism my ass. Everyone knows the Nazi party is bad. Idiotic non-researched one sided "journalism" by right wingers who wouldn't know a terrorist from their ass from a hole in the ground are the real problem.

Also Mein Kampf, and the Communist Manifesto are decent reads and if you're secure in your political stance there is no danger in reading them.

Thank you for that scintillating insightful analysis. Have you read Orwell's Animal Farm ?<BR><BR>
Whilst the end results of Naziism were bad most people would agree, the Nazis themselves were for the most part ordinary Germans with a bit of a chip on their shoulder about the Treaty of Versailles.<BR><BR>
Nazi policies got thousands of ordinary Germans back to work, and created the <a href="http://www.autobahn-online.de/geschichte_e.html">Autobahn</a> system, still in use today.<BR><BR>
Whilst <strong>in no way supporting or condoning the racist atrocities of the Nazi regime</strong>, I feel it is important to stress that the Nazis were just another political movement. If you demonize them, you allow yourself to distance yourself from the possibility that they might rise again.
<BR><BR>
It is not black and white. For many Germans the Nazi party was a ray of hope. A party like that does not sieze power against the wishes of the majority.<BR><BR>
So whilst you may "know" that Nazis are "bad" you would be doing yourself and the rest of the world a favor if you did a little bit of research yourself.<BR><br><i>time to give a Newtonian demonstration - of a bullet, its mass and its acceleration.</i><br>
