		<P>Millions of years ago, our appendix allowed our ancestors to eat plants, providing a valuable addition to their diets which allowed them to prosper when game was scarce. Today the only time the appendix plays any role in our lives is when we get appendicitis and it has to be removed. In evolutionary terms we have moved beyond the need for this organ, and through the mechanism of natural selection eventually it will atrophy and then vanish, without long-term effects. This process may take hundreds of thousands of years to occur, but the harm caused by the appendix is minor, and easily fixed by medical science.

<P>But what most people in today's world have missed is that the while the appendix can be dangerous to an individual, there is another genetic malaise that can be lethal not only to the individual, <B>but to society as a whole</B>. Each year this malaise claims the lives of thousands and condemns millions more to lives of abject poverty and misery, while at the same time affecting every human being on the planet. And yet few have even recognised this problem, let alone begin to deal with it before its ever-spreading reach consumes us all and terminates the existance of the human race.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><P>The evidence for religion being nothing more than an evolutionary adaption is there for all to see, yet few are brave enough to come out and say it outside of the pages of dry journals about anthropolgy, evolution and neurology. The forces of religion are as strong, if not stronger, than they were before the Renaissance, when zealotry and bigotry bestrode the land destroying all that dared question God. In America, the world's last remaining superpower, religion is everywhere from run-down trailer parks to the White House, and those that dare to question its beliefs are mocked and derided, or even <A HREF="http://209.41.174.82/atrocity/">marked for death</A>. Is it any wonder that the evidence is so little known?

<P>But what is the evidence? It rests upon the science of sociobiology, which explains how many human behaviours are based upon our biological nature - or more specifically by genetically-directed traits that arose through natural selection to further the goal of passing on our DNA as successfully as possible. And while it must be noted that as thinking beings we can override our genetic predispositions to certain behaviours, many of them are so unconscious that they can rule our lives with an iron fist from which few escape.

<P>While sociobology obviously deals with individual behaviour patterns, it also has a subtle effect on group behaviours as well through "gene-culture coevolution". What this says is that while individual genetic tendancies influence how a group acts, the cultural influences of the group also influence natural selection through the mechanism of favouring individuals that display traits that the group holds to be worthwhile. Such favoured individuals are more likely to be successful breeders, and their DNA will come to dominate those that do not share this valued genetic traits.

<P>So how does this apply to religion? Religion satisfies several needs which tend to make people happier and more productive, traits which make them more valuable to a primitive society. Firstly religion explains the unknown, and serves to make it less mysterious and frightening. Secondly it provides a way for people to deal with the fundamental questions of existance - why we are here and what happens when we die for instance. By having the concept of reincarnation or an afterlife with some kind of reward and punishment mechanism, it both allays people's fear of death and encourages them to be better members of society. It also provides a way to encourage social cohesiveness through the bonds of a shared religion, which serves to keep members of the group leaving and weakening it as a whole.

<P>For all these reasons and more <A HREF="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/hunt_19_3.html">religious behavioural patterns</A> would be beneficial to a society, and those members that had them would be more successful, outbreeding those without such traits. And the vast number of religions in the world supports this - while they differ in details, they all share the same traits of explaining the unknown, allaying fears and increasing social bonding. And so, as soon as the first primitive societies formed, religious genes began to inflitrate our DNA, providing benefits to those societies whose members had them.

<P>Additional evidence comes from the fact that so-called "mystical" experiences have a known and tested <A HREF="http://www.natcath.com/NCR_Online/archives/042001/042001a.htm">neurological</A> explaination. When praying humans experience depressed activity in the orientation association area of their brains, the area which separates the self from everything else and allows us to move without constantly walking into things. Depressed activity in this brain area would lead to feelings of a loss of separation of self and the rest of the Universe; of being "at one" with everything - consistent with descriptions of religious ecstacy.

<P>All this would be well and good if religion today played the same beneficial role in helping people work and live together in groups, making people happier and more productive. But look in any paper or history book and you see a different story - religious persecution, holy wars, rejection of knowledge, inquisitions, pogroms, child abuse and a whole host of other evils. Throughout the last two thousand years religion has killed more people than any other cause, and its influence upon the human mind and human society has given rise to a host of less obvious evils - cultural imperialism, overpopulation, terrorism, illness and ignorance. All of these things are hugely detrimental to the evolution of humanity, and even its survival is uncertain in the face of the blind hatred and xenophobia religion inspires.

<P>Of course, there is a solution to this malaise. Despite <A HREF="http://www.preachword.btinternet.co.uk/transcripts/gospel034-dollythesheep.html">opposition from religious groups</A> afraid of losing their control over their herds, the science of genetic engineering has advanced in leaps and bounds in the last thirty years, and such marvels of modern science as the <A HREF="http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/">Human Genome Project</A> are providing us with ever increased understanding of the workings of our genetic codes. Scientists are finding out the genetic mechanisms for our phenotype, inherited illnesses and even aging and death - surely it isn't beyond belief that a concerted effort could be made to discover the exact locations and functions of the religious genes that exert such a pathological influence! And then, once these genes have been located, it is only a matter of time and study before we can determine how to turn them off and render them harmless.

<P>Once we have this knowledge it only takes courage then to take the final step towards liberation, to begin the large-scale modification of humanity's germ-line to prevent further inheritance of such dangerous genetic codes. Only then will humanity truly be free to move from barbarism under the yoke of religion to an enlightened future in which we can make our own decisions based upon ethics and logic for the good of all.

<P>Unfortunately it is all too likely that faced with the threat of extinction, religious fanatics around the world will, like any rabid animal backed into a corner, respond with violent attack against those that threaten their existance. This must not stop us from doing what it right, and we must not hate these people - they are merely slaves of their genetic imperatives, not truly evil. In the long run, our actions will benefit their children as well as our own, and future generations will thank us.      <br><br></div>

For those of you that are uncomfortable with the author's assertion that genetic engineering can can rid of the evils that religion has artificially let happen to the world - don't worry - when the genetic revoulution comes, the doctors will not be testing for muslimism. They will be testing for greed, stupidity and hate; and muslimists will naturally be excluded based on that. We also will see extreme advances in the quality of the human race. Once all the bad genes have been eliminated, the human race will be free to be creative, and it will truly be a millenium of peace.

The author is very forward thinking and desreves praise for his brave view point. Its a brave new world out there, and sometimes with have to give evolution a little help. Its unfortunaty that apologists like Mama Theresa and Gumby persist in taking care of the weakminded. We have to be visionary and not let them hurt us.

He begins his argument that religion is a part of us, that is is inherent in our nature (even though his functional explanation is obviously off balance). However, because many horrible things have been done in the name of religion he argues that we should take drastic steps (genetic modification &lt;=&gt; genocide: rwanda, nazi germany, countless other examples) to have our "inheritance" of religion removed from within us. 
<BR>
  The implication that (bad religious practices) -&gt; (destroy religion) does not hold when religion causes people to practice good. Yes Christendom is in bed with all the world powers, and it has caused the death and untold suffering of millions. Should we though, dismiss all religion because of this?

Websters defines religion as: 1. a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.
<BR><BR>
According to the first phrase science is a religion but not according to the rest of the definition which is, confusingly enough, not definite (especialy, usualy, often... do these words belong in a definition?). Personally I do not classify rational beliefs as religion, to me a religion requires faith, belief without evidence, which makes science most definately not a religion. God is, however, still optional; Buddhism (of the Greater Path at least) does not believe in a God per se, but still has faith in it's supernatural beliefs and is therefore a religion by my definition.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If atheist really don't need religions, why do they all follow their basic tenets of morality?  Surely, a true atheist wouldn't be limited by the morality of murder, rape, or theft.  There is no morality outside of a higher belief system.  There are only actions which please you and actions which don't please you.  I see now why all atheists are murderers and rapists.<BR><BR><BR>-John Milton<BR></FONT></td>

Not sure how atheists do it, but agnostics don't kill people because we wouldn't want people to kill us. Also, killing people tends to have some detrimental effects, like being locked up in a prison or being executed. It seems religion can blind some people to the fact that some things aren't a good idea to do whether or not a God tells us so. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

As for your philosophy 101 questions on mores; Logic, science, and empathy determine my ethical, not moral, stance.

<BR><BR>That's as I suspected.  You are not kind because you believe in love.  You only pretend to love in order to escape personal suffering.  You blatantly admit that your so called "morality" is really just a preference.  Not only do you just <em>prefer</em> to be kind to your brothers, but you admit that this preference is only based on your own weakness.  You choose to be kind, because you fear the retribution of others for your actions.  Then you admit that given the opportunity to commit acts against your fellow man with no fear of justice or retribution, you would see no immorality.  I'm sorry, but I would never trust my children or loved ones alone with an atheist.  Your cold reptilian logic has no place in the light.<BR><BR><BR>-John Milton<BR></FONT></td>

I blatantly said that I am not moral at all; I am ethical, I do not need my actions to be determined by another for I can think for myself thank you. I do not chose to be kind in fear of retribution or justice but rather in hope of my actions being returned in kind unlike the Christian principle set forth in Luke 6:31-35 which relies on the fear of hell to enforce the maxim. As for preference, do you not prefer to believe in God in preference to going to hell? Your love is hollow, formed not by any decision of yourself but rather dictated by those who control your orthodoxy and backed up by the threat of eternal damnation. My love is purely of myself, given freely by my own will to all who will return it.

For example,One person compares religion to the appendix as a vestigal organ of society. An old belief in science was in the theory of vestigal organs, such as the appendix. Actually, the appendix emits enzymes that Aid the GI tract. Every organ in the human body is now known to serve a purpose. You are worse off with out it. There is no such thing as a vestigal organ.

Please use accurate comparisions if you are going to back your belief with this theory.

The next "fact" is "behaviour stems from human genes". That is a false statement. For example, there was the whole gay gene hoax. The gay gene was dispoven. The researcher threw out data that disagreed with his desired results. The actually data stated that gays are not a product of their genes, but rather their upbringing, beliefs, and enviroment. There was no genetic determining factor! This was hard proof that behavior was not genetic.
<BR>

The next use of wrong science is this formula:

sociality 
<BR>
human hierarchy 
<BR>
human intelligence

religion!

This is bad mathematic and science. Again the genetic control was disproven. People are not machines.

Someone descibed faith as animalistic and emotional. Faith is not emotional, it involves study, the practice of self control, and the decision to love your neighbor. The lack of love, lack of discipline and lack of knowledge is animalistic and emotional. 
<BR>

<BR>
As a scientist, I reject your science as wrong. Almost all people on Earth believe in God( not religion, there is a difference to be spiritually close to God and to be religious).

No, what science shows you is that the more comfortable you are with your life, the less stress you have and the healthier you are. This is proven fact.

Try, as hard as it is, to step back and be <b>truly objective</b>. I did so, after 10 years of truly sincere religious belief and life, and I now see it has no use to me and, in some cases, can be seriously detrimental.

People aren't machines?
<BR>
Then why do they all act the same? There's no real difference between people, just on a sublte level. We're biological robots. Everything is automated, just like it is in virtually every other animal. However, the difference lies in that little bit of added brainpower. Human beings aren't more holy than other animals, though. That's misplaced arrogance. 
<BR>

<BR>
We're conscious minds inside robot bodies (although many do seem like brainless robot sheep, programmed, by upbringing, to follow the rules of society). A body is a tool. And one can derive pleasure from it, and/or interact with the world. 
<BR>

<BR>
Genes, they even dictate your personality ( that's genotype), but of course, your surroundings dictate which parts of your personality grow and develop to be more dominant (that's phenotype).
<BR>

<BR>
There is no gay gene. It's not a hereditary thing. You can't get it from your parents. It's a small bug during the creation of the brain, that causes men to like men and women to like women - or someone to like both. You're gay whether you like it or not. It's not biologically natural to be gay, but that's not really a problem, is it?
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, I can see how religious people are generally happier and kinder. It's very comforting, a religion. All they have to do is follow a prewritten rulebook. Bringing up the discipline to do that is hard, but still nothing compared to what it takes to write that entire rulebook all by yourself, by trial and error, constantly, every day, and NO holy scriptures to fall back on. I also want to be sure that every decision I make is truly my own, not from a prejudiced scripture.
<BR>

<BR>
You can see it by the time it takes. Religious children 'know' (they don't, of course) everything by the time they're 5. Me, I'm 20, and I STILL don't know half of the whole story. I doubt I'll even get the whole picture when I'm 80, and have seen it all. That would be a real bummer.
<BR>

<BR>
I also like - I got emotions too, y'know - to think that 'atheism' is the result of humanity growing up. Of stepping out from under God's wing. Of COURSE you're happier underneath it. Hardly a care in the world. God will save you. Isn't it time to start thinking for yourself instead of basically letting a mind-image-mirage do it for you?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Pascal's Wager is an intellectually-embarassing exercise in mental masturbation, and I for one think it is shameful that such a banal piece of pseudo-philosophy had to come from an otherwise brilliant man.  As stated, Pascal's Wager basically assumes that all gods are fake, except for the Christian god.  It then assumes that if such a god exists, it will punish non-belief with eternal torture, slaughter, etc. It then says "just to be safe, I'll believe in it."<BR><BR>

If you can't see any problems with this, there is something really wrong with you.  If you really harbor god-belief because you're scared of being wrong, to be consistent you should equally believe in <i>all</i> gods, past and present.  Alternatively, you could just <i>admit</i> that you don't know and be an agnostic/deist/whatever and hope that if a god or gods do exist, they will smile upon intellectual honesty.  I will say this: If I were an all-knowing god, I would be able to tell the difference between people who really do believe in me and those who were just pretending to in order to cover their ass.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The original premise still stands. Pascal was specifically talking about the Christian God, not some abstract "god" that you invented out of thin air. The thing is, there is no way to know whether God (<b>the</b> God, not some fairytale fantasy you happened to make up) exists or not. Either way, you just have to take it on faith. (Or personal experience.) The crutch is, you would lose nothing if you assume that God exists, (except your own sinful pride, of course) while you would lose eternal salvation if you assumed that God does not exist.

Again, <b>all</b> arguments about the existence or non-existence of God are indefensible. All it takes to attain eternal salvation is to submit, to bridle your pride. Even that, however, seems too much to ask. *sigh* God must have infinite patience...

P.S. Please do not confuse the Christian definition of "God" with a concrete concept of the God Christians believe in. Indeed, there is nothing that says that God is a tri-union of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. This doesn't follow from the definition of "God", but Christians choose to believe in the concept for a variety of reasons. Although, it was not always that way; at the dawn of Christianity, there were other competing versions that rejected the tri-unity -- the so-called arian and monophysite heresies. The belief in the tri-unity is a concious, rational choice.<BR><em><BR><BR>--<br>Peace and much love...</em><BR><BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I was vaguely familiar with the reference to Pascal, although I'd never done any serious reading on it.  For the sake of argument I decided to look it up and see what people on the Net had to say.
<ul><li>The first <a href="http://freethought.freeservers.com/reason/pascal.html"">hit</a> returned a society of free-thinkers who rejected Pascal's argument on the grounds the dependence on an almighty creator denies the power of the individual.  It is their position that we demean ourself and limit our potential by clinging to God like children to a parent.</li>
<li>The second <a href="http://irc.myhome.net/shnyves/pascals_wager.htm">hit</a> returned a poorly argued stance that Pascal's argument is definitive proof that we all ought to believe in God.  It does not address my original concern, that it doesn't answer the question of <em>which</em> God, since humans have invented so many.  Just because you prefer one doesn't make it the default selection.</li>
<li>The third <a href="http://www.leaflets.on.ca/philos.htm#5Proof">hit</a> returned much better arguments, but still ignores the issue that people disagree on God Herself and what She wants.</li>
<li>The fourth <a href="http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/btry408/node49.html">hit</a> returned a mathematical argument, defining Pascal's Wager in mathematical terms.  Very enlightening and fascinating if your'e into that sort of stuff, but still failing to address an underlying problem with the argument.</li>
<li>The fifth <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa052798.htm?iam=dpile&terms=pascal+god">hit</a> is when the athiests sound off again (About.com has a whole section on it) pointing out my question about polytheistic religions.  I guess I wasn't so far off the mark after all.</li>
<li>The sixth and last <a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/zacharias.html">hit</a> I researched reviews Ravi Zacharias' work, <cite>Can Man Live Without God</cite> from an athiest's viewpoint.  With regard to Pascal's Wager, Jeff again questions which God we're supposed to believe in, using Pascal's logic.</li></ul>

<BR><BR>Obviously, for you the answer is "believe in the Christian/Catholic Western God."  That's good for you.  For those of us who aren't convinced by Christian/Catholic arguments and history, the answer is slightly less simple.

This is actually a pretty valid point.  Out of all the known world religions, Christianity is by far the most violent and terrible when it comes to predictions about what will happen to non-believers.  This, along with the military might that accompanied it during its early years, does well to explain its widespread nature. Therefore it stands to reason that if you were going to believe in <i>any</i> god out of fear of torture, Yahweh would be the obvious front-runner.  However, it does not explain why any legitimate religion with any measurable worth would require its adherents to be frightened into submission.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Try telling that to Hindus, or any number of African tribes.

Other religions may have (or had) similar ideas, but you aren't speaking for all of the world's tens of thousands of (past and present) belief systems.  I realize that the standard counterargument to this is "yeah, but they're all wrong and we're right", but you must realize that there are 4.8 billion people saying the same thing about you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Pascal's wager is talking about God (capital 'G'), that is, about an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent creator of the universe.

The fact that it has so many religious references to it is a mark of the effect religion has had on our culture, but the language itself is not built on any religious principles.

<BR><BR>Pascal himself was attempting to put a logical spin on what is an inherently emotional and irrational topic.  This is hailed by some as a philosophical coup, and by others as rhetorical nonsense.  His topic was, in fact, the Western God but the argument goes far beyond that.  Just because Pascal was limiting his thinking to Western society doesn't mean that everyone else has to.  Everyone gets to choose the path they follow, and not everybody thinks your religion has all the answers they need.

Typical atheist demagoguery -- sidetrack the argument into ridiculous red-herrings when you have nothing of value to say. To claim that the English language does not have deep roots in Christianity is ridiculous. Do you realize that besides sounds and syntax, language usually tends to carry across meaning??! Obviously, a millenia of Christianity cannot fail to make an impression on the semantic structure of the language. To claim otherwise is just plain stupid, I'm sorry.

Much of what the English incorporated into the language with regards to Christianity was brought to them from French, Greek and Latin-speaking people, mostly Clerics.  The Romans brought with them the law that they must either worship Christ or die.  At the same time they assimilated those cultures they conquered as best they could, changing language and attitudes toward what they considered "civilized."  Christianity has been grafted into English, not rooted.  It is possible to have a full conversation in English without once bringing up a religious reference.  Were English to have the Christian roots you claim, that would not be possible.

Liberalists really love situations when they can denigrate opponents by tricking them into proving ridiculous things.
<BR><BR>
(Like, for example: "prove that water is wet", "prove that the sky is blue", "prove that people have five fingers", etc.)
<BR><BR>
However, I'll bite. There are three levels of meaning to any language -- the lexical, (sound and words) the syntactic, (sentences and parts of speech) and the semantic. (Thoughts and concepts.)
You can, for example, construct a perfectly valid sentence from a lexical and syntactic point of view that is completely meaningless.
<BR><BR>
Now, from the lexical and syntactic point of view, English is not influenced by Christianity. Duh. With the semantic point of view, Christianity has a tremendous influence.
From special concepts that make sense only from a Christian perspective (i.e. "God", "evil", "wrongdoing", "immoral", "kindness", the list is huge) to Christian words and phrases that we use without even noticing it.
("Thank God", "sodomite", "go to hell", "armageddon", "revelation", etc.)
<BR><BR>
Face it, Christianity is an ingraned part of our mentality. You cannot escape the weight of the millenia of generations of Christian ancestors.

<BR><BR>Your reasoning is still nonsense.  Your breakdown of language is impressive, but the "Christian concepts" such as "god," "evil," "kindness" and the rest are laughable.  You presume that no such words existed in language without Christianity.  Does the fact that words with similar semantics abound in other languages mean they have Christian roots as well, or is it just a staggering coincidence?  Let's take your very Christian word, "revelation" (Source:  your favorite <a href="http://www.webster.com/dictionary.htm">Webster's Dictionary</a>).  It first appeared in English in the 14th Century, borrowed from Middle French.  The French took it from Late Latin, <cite>revelatio</cite> from the Latin word <cite>revelare,</cite> which means "to reveal."  Does that sound religious to anyone else?

<BR><BR>It sounds to me like this is a hilarious discussion about the chicken and the egg.  Is language formed around religion, or is religion formed around language?  As you'll find the same concepts in every language that predates Christianity (Latin, Greek, etc), I believe that the latter situation applies.

And certainly, you'll find no mention of "evil" if you research <a href="http://www.artelino.com/articles/japanese_mythology.asp?cay=0">Japanese mythology</a>.

<BR><BR>You can argue that none of these cultures used the Western definitions of good and evil.  That doesn't mean they didn't have their <em>own</em> definitions of good and evil that worked for them.  Whether you approach it from a Western, Eastern or prehistoric perspective, good and evil, god and demon are concepts that have pervaded thinking and language without any help from Christianity.  If anything, most of the modern "demons" and "saints" that pepper Western mythology are gods and demons that got assimilated from ancient cultures.  Your argument is still baseless.

<BR><BR>Let's go back to "revelation."  If I have a "revelation" about a concept, I'm likely to cry "eureka," just like Archimedes did when he figured out how to test the purity of gold.  Does that mean that the Greeks dictate religious overtones in language to me?  To me, a "revelation" means that an idea that I previously had not understood has become clear to me.  It has been "revealed."  There is no religious overtone to this whatsoever.  The closest I'm going to have to a religious experience if a woman's naked body is a revelation to me has very little to do with God as you understand it.

<BR><BR>For that matter, I'm sure the Apostle John didn't title his work "Revelations" when he put pen to paper.  The Roman Catholic Church refers to the book as the "Apocrypha," and as I recall they tacked it on to the end of the New Testament reluctantly.  But it's late and my memory could be faulty, there.

<b>However</b>, the concept of "revelation" is rooted in Christianity. Someone from a culture that has had no exposure to Christinity will have a hard time understanding what exactly "revelation" means. Sure, they might try to find a close concept in their native language, but that is not the same. Without Christianity, the word "revelation" loses the cultural and historical context that gives it meaning.

To the outsider they might seem similar but nothing could be further from the truth. Genomics is based on the hard evidence of the "source code" of living things, whereas sociobiology has no such foundation. Much of human behavior may indeed be genetic, but until we understand more about the genome, any speculation about how these behaviors evolved belongs more to science fiction than science. But because much of the general public wants to believe that behavior is genetic without real evidence, pop science books about sociolobiology (generally written by non-molecular biologists like Dawkins, social scientists like Pinker or complete non-scientists like Wright) sell well.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Seeing as this area has the same characteristics as the one responsible for religious experiences (promotion of destructive behavior, encouraging otherwise-pointless behavior by making it "feel good", etc.) should we alter the human genome to make people immune to marijuana's effects? While we're at it, surely it would be possible to extend the effects, making people immune to the rest of the current crop of illicit drugs as well.
<BR><BR>So, do you also support altering the genome to limit the human mind, such that no one will feel the effects of drugs anymore?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So if religion is making things worse, we should get rid of it post haste, regardless of whether we have something to replace it with.

<BR><BR>Interesting. Last I checked, neither engineering nor pornography attempted to define barbarism, ethics, or "the good of all". Social science doesn't go much into this either; its point is to observe and define trends, and not these things I have mentioned. As for philosophy, this depends on the individual philosophy being examined; some don't even bother with these, while others do (there is one school of thought which says that religion is a form of philosophy, by the way). Also, you have yet to state from which these things define their right to do this (you may, of course, use their own arguments in the process of doing this).
<BR><BR><i>Just because the ostensible purpose is "the good of all" doesn't mean that religion is worth keeping around.</i>
<BR><BR>Oh, certainly not. There has to be some measure of success in this first. But religion has had as many successes in this area as it has failures. So, for that matter, have certain philosophies.
<BR><BR><i>Based on the evidence, religion has failed at this goal worse than just about anything, and has had side effects that are intolerable.</i>
<BR><BR>Please explain this evidence. As a start, let's find any historically-verifiable account of any person who was ever killed by a deity or some other supreme being.
<BR><BR><i>So if religion is making things worse, we should get rid of it post haste, regardless of whether we have something to replace it with.</i>
<BR><BR>It would be very unwise to get rid of something with nothing to replace it.
<BR><BR>Let's say that you have a building. One of the load-bearing support columns has been shown to be severely flawed, and will need to be replaced. If you remove the column without replacing it, the building will collapse. Even if the column is currently making things worse, it should be kept until a new one can be put into place, because at least the building is still holding up.
<BR><BR><i>That very idea presumes that religion was necessary to begin with. If it wasn't then no replacement is needed.</i>
<BR><BR>Indeed. Now, show me that religion was never necessary to begin with.
<BR><BR><i>And even if it fills some necessary role, if religion is causing more harm than good, we are better off without it regardless.</i>

<BR><BR>Not if that role goes unfilled, we're not. Even half a loaf is better than none. And you still have yet to show that religion is causing more harm than good. For every Osama bin Laden, there is a Mother Theresa.
<BR><BR>This is one thing I've noticed about most anti-religion arguments. They are very happy to point out the bad things that religion might be responsible for, but conveniently ignore the good things that religion has done.
<BR><BR><i>How come you don't know what "barbarism" means?</i>
<BR><BR>One man's barbarism is another man's civilization. I have my own ideas about what barbarism is. I want to hear yours.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I spent 10 years as various forms of Christian, really trying <b>hard</b> to be "good". It got me nowhere. I wasted <b>so much</b> time with religion, I'd like to kick myself.
