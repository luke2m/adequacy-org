		There are many historians that will tell you that <a href="http://viking.no/e/people/e-knud.htm">King Canute</a> did not believe that he could command the waves, linguists will tell you the correct pronounciation of Don Quixote is <i>'Khee-HO-tay'</i> and pedants will blanche when envision is used to replace foresee, imagine, and believe.

<p>
<B>[editor's note, by em]</B> The correct pronunciation of "Quijote", transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is either [ki'xote] or [ki'hote], depending on dialectal variation; certainly not that "Khee-HO-tay" gringo crap that's right up there, which will only result in your pronouncing all the sounds except the "h" wrong.  And there are over 300 million spanish speakers who, despite not being linguists, can tell you this.  Perhaps one of them cleans your workspace at 2:00 AM.        </div>

<BR><BR>Pinging is only bad if you initiate a ping storm.  I guess if you think pinging is bad why don't you get off the internet?  You do know that your computer pings another system pretty much all the time don't you?  Perhaps you could do well to <a href="http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/ping.html">read about PING</a> from its original author.  Oh my gosh, this guy was part of DARPA!  And ping is not slang for anything.  It's simply an acronym and it's ping not P.I.N.G.  <b>P</b>acket <b>IN</b>ternet <b>G</b>roper

<BR><BR>By the way, what the hell is 404ing?  You do know what 404 means don't you?  It's simply means <i>file not found</i>.  It's one of many HTTP messages initiated by the <b>server</b> not outside users.

Uhh, ahem, don't accuse me of using illegal hacker operating systems to prove your point. I use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp">Windows XP</a>, the latest in a robust, stable line of Windows platforms from Microsoft. I can assure you that my computer doesn't "ping another system pretty much all the time."<BR><BR>
<b>Perhaps you could do well to read about PING from its original author.</b><BR><BR>
Excuse me, I am <i>not</i> going to be coerced into following your tracing link to the military. As a proud <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie">Internet Explorer</a> user, I am able to detect your little trojan backdooring before you try to forward your IP theft to the military under my computer's datagram ID.<BR><BR>
<b>And ping is not slang for anything. It's simply an acronym and it's ping not P.I.N.G. Packet INternet Groper</b><BR><BR>
That's what I said. I don't want any groper trying to break its way into my Windows XP Firewall. Fortunately, I don't have to worry about it, but there are many unprotected machines on the Internet who don't have the luxury I am offered by <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>.<BR><BR>
<b>You do know what 404 means don't you? It's simply means <i>file not found</i>.</b><BR><BR>
Exactly. The hacker, such as yourself I imagine, illegally 404s the file from the web server and dumps the "core datafile" to the logs. Then, an unsuspecting visitor such as I or any one of the freedom supporting Americans on <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> (yourself not included), will get their iMAC address recorded by the trojanned apache.<BR><BR>
<b>HTTP error messages</b><BR><BR>
Don't try to pin these errors across the board. As far as I see, or any other common-sense ridden viewer of <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> (yourself not included), these aren't "HTTP" errors, these are <i>apache</i> errors. That's right, the open sores software of the world <i>does</i> get "internal server errors" and "too many users" (frequently on Lunix, I might add). Perhaps you should "patch" your own sauce code before you go and try to blame the whole internet on your little "HTTP error messages." Get a clue.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

We've gone over this before. I'd be damned if I were going to fall for your little 'ping' trick.

My Windows XP firewall keeps logs of all the attacks made against it, and it's damn good. It certainly stopped you from hacking into my system registry on more than one occasion.

Yeah, right. That's why I always see "500 Internal Server Error - Apache/1.3.23 Server at website Port 80." I never see "Microsoft IIS at website Port 80." No sir.

<BR><BR>First off they run Windows 2000 not .NET because there is no version beyond W2K.  The next server OS from Microsoft is called simply Server.NET and it's not due out until mid/late 2004.

Is that some kind of bad joke? I have had the pleasure working with plenty of IIS implementations on database server architectures. Unfortunately, I have also tested rudimentary implementations of apache, and it wasn't pretty. Where is Apache's control panel for adding folders, starting and stopping the process? This isn't 1970 anymore, buckeroo.<BR><BR>

But yet IIS has "custom" numbers. Yeah. Right. Whatever. Hey, news flash, your W3C crap won't cut it here. Patch your sauce code or admit you're wrong.<BR><BR>

I could say the same to you, but your only proof is illegal internal military ethernets that I would get busted for if I checked. Gotcha.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>I have had the pleasure working with plenty of IIS implementations on database server architectures.</i>

I helped with migration of several servers from IIS to Apache. There were no problems with any one of the machines from then. This was after the Code Red 1/2 surge.

Good old 1970's. Because of this technology, I can troubleshoot the servers from a Nokia Communicator - even from a running car. The principles from 1970's help me easily take care about machines in several different countries.
You can play with your pretty icons as you want - but when things will get tough, you will cry for a VT52 terminal.

<BR><BR>Yes I'm sure Microsoft spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on mainframes.  Amazing how companies like IBM never see a dime.  Get it sttraight.  Windows runs on x86 platforms.  More likely they're running servers utilizes multiple Intel/AMD processors.  Also the .NET framework isn't finish.  Basically Passport and other such services are only bits and pieces of what .NET is.  Hell Microsoft can't even figure out what it is.

Basically instead of using the cryptic 404-File Not Found they replace it with "Sorry that file cannot be found on this server" or something to that effect.  It's the same message just made more dumbass friendly.

With a computer already next to everywhere, tough luck. And computer manufacturers wouldn't like it.
<BR><BR>
And even if it would happen, a black market with computers would appear overnight.
<BR><BR>
<i>get Microsoft to assist with this.</i>
<BR><BR>
If you mean to randomly reduce access to computers by crashing them, they are already doing it. And not every machine is MS-dependent.
<BR><BR>
<i>I don't know how to write code...should I learn to so I can use my God-given right?</i>
<BR><BR>
If you want to have the power that comes with the knowledge, yes.
<BR><BR>
<i>And how can you say that you have the 'right' to make code?</i>
<BR><BR>
How you can say I don't?
<BR><BR>
<i>Do you also believe that music and software should be free and that software and music piracy is good because you're 'sticking it to the Man'?</i>
<BR><BR>
Irrelevant for this discussion.
<BR><BR>
<i>I'm afraid I don't exactly understand why you think that coding is a right.</i>
<BR><BR>
I am afraid I don't understand why it shouldn't be. Code is a form of self-expression. If writing in human-readable languages is allowed, why computer-readable languages should be any exception? The only difference is in the strictness of syntax rules.
<BR><BR>
<i>Sure, but if you have good security and nobody is nuking your box, isn't that twice as good?</i>
<BR><BR>
No. Failed attempts in logs serve for two purposes: they serve as a mild ego-booster, and they keep the admins in touch with the reality, reminding them about the dangers and keeping them on feet, and letting them know that the monitoring and logging systems are functional. I prefer low sustaining levels of danger over apparent safety. Too quiet situation only means that the excrement is already on its way towards the fan.
