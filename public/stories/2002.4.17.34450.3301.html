Seeing as how posts made by Yoshi and osm are generally identical, it is a great way to discredit those from osm as well.

<BR><BR>I myself am looking forward to similar stories/diaries which do the same in regards to diaries/stories/posts from elenchos as well.

<BR><BR>I have to agree with detikon as well as many others.  It's perfectly fine to fancy one piece of software over the other, but to resort to ridiculous claims based on general lack of knowledge is not.

<BR><BR><b>Example:</b><br>
HTML -- <br>
<i>Yoshi</i> >> Microsoft HyperText Movement Language Protocol

<BR><BR><i>Real</i> >>  Hypertext Markup Language (a documnet format not a protocol)
<ul>The document format used on the World Wide Web. Web pages are built with HTML tags (codes) embedded in the text. HTML defines the page layout, fonts and graphic elements as well as the hypertext links to other documents on the Web. Each link contains the URL, or address, of a Web page residing on the same server or any server worldwide, hence "World Wide" Web.

<BR><BR>HTML 2.0 was defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with a basic set of features, including interactive forms capability. Subsequent versions added more features such as blinking text, custom backgrounds and tables of contents. However, each new version requires agreement on the tags used, and browsers must be modified to implement those tags.

<BR><BR>HTML is not a programming language like Java or JavaScript (if this, do that), rather it could be considered a "presentation language." HTML is derived from SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language, which is widely used to publish documents. HTML is an SGML document with a fixed set of tags that, although change with each new revision, are not flexible.

<BR><BR>A subset of SGML, known as XML, allows the developer of the page to define the tags, and HTML 4.0 and XML 1.0 have been combined into a single format called "XHTML," which is expected to become the standard format for Web pages. XHTML also enables Web pages to be developed with different sets of data so that handheld devices, with limited screen sizes, can download abbreviated pages.</ul><BR><BR></FONT></td>

Because they will then use it, and as they will not know the critical details they will inevitably screw up and then will cry and beg for help. Sheesh. *sigh* But what one can expect from the individuals that so often don't even know that devices tend to work better when switched on.

Because the devil is in the details. Because of someone mistaking one such detail - swapping the black and the white wire[1] in the fuse box - I once almost got fried; I ended hanging for few seconds between a heater that was grounded, and a computer chassis with 240V on it. Never underestimate the details. Details kill.

[1] Decades old norm (and decades old house); current colors are black or brown for live, blue for zero, and green/yellow for safety ground - don't dare to mismatch them.

Freely-available software (especially with source code) can destroy whole corporations. From one angle it can look like a form of industrial terrorism. From all the other angles, it is a freedom fight.

The most attention-worthy target is Microsoft. They used the same strategy (MSIE vs Netscape, and couple more less newsworthy cases) to sink their competition. Now the card is turning and they cry bloody murder. And, frankly, I somehow don't feel any pity for them.

<BR><BR>Yes they are.  On all count.  Microsoft still maintains its desktop market share.  However, it's not as popular in the server rooms.  This is generally where it has been on a somewhat level playing field with Unix (now include variant such as Linux and *BSD).

<BR><BR>Actually it's quite the oppposite.  I suggest you do a little digging.

All <a href="../index.html">Adequacy</a> readers are aware that Open Source advocates have an intense desire to write point by point rebuttals, every bit as strong as their tendency toward pedophelia, so there is no need to cast a veil of secrecy over it for us.<BR><BR>

You complain about Yoshi's links to <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>. I cannot think of a more valid authority on the subject of computer software than the largest computer software firm on earth. He could have picked some lesser vendor, like <a href="http://www.oraclesmallbusiness.com">Oracle</a>, but then his points would not have been supported by the enormous research investment that <a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> surely made.<BR><BR>

Also, I do not generally appreciate ad hominem attacks, although I understand that when a person has little else at their disposal they tend to creep in to the conversation. Regardless, if Linux (I'll use your preferred spelling to stave off being called something worse than 'dumbass') is not trying to position itself as an 'open source' Windows, why does it <a href="http://www.lindows.com">copy</a> nearly every design feature of Windows? When a new version of Windows is released the various Lenux 'distros' immediately start working on copying every new feature. Windows <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/archive/BUSBIOS/usbwin98.asp">implements USB</a>, <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org">Linux does four years later</a>. Windows gets a <a href="http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/answerstips/story/0,24330,2456178,00.html">Start button</a>, <a href="http://molsim.chem.uva.nl/masterclass00/linux/desktop.html">Linux does four years later</a>.<BR><BR>

It is amazing that despite what you claim are the desires of the '<a href="http://slashdot.org">Open Source Community</a>', Linux is the same thing as Windows was four years ago.<BR><BR>

If Lenux is not being positioned as a Windows competitor, why has it been designed to be <a href="http://screenshots.sourceforge.net/misc/linuxonwindowsturf.html">virtually identical</a>? If Windows is so terrible, why make your favorite operating system <a href="http://www.mlug.ca/faq/faq1/win_html">exactly like it</a>?

When Microsoft implements a feature into Windows, it's "copying" to you Lunix zealots.

<BR><BR>It's rather difficult to call it stealing when they're not Microsoft's in the first place.  Not a single principle is specific to Microsoft operating systems.  Hell even Windows raises a lot of questions.  You know that MS claims to hold trademarks on a lot of generic word like Office.  In fact their trademark is for Microsoft Office.

<BR><BR>Seeing as how Microsoft did not create nor does it own any specific pieces of the GUI they use the specific parts are actually fair game.  In many ways they can be considered open standards.  Basically same concepts different names (Start button/Taskbar = WarpCenter (OS/2)).  There are many things that window managers like KDE and GNOME offer that GUIs like Luna do not.  Virtual desktops for one.  So if you want to claim that these ideas are "stolen" from Microsoft then please do not forget to mention who Microsoft "stole" them from first.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I would say not bad for developers working with little to no help from devices manufaturers.  Amazingly enough that is changing.  However, let's not forget how long PnP was available with Macs and OS/2 before it <i>finally</i> showed up in Windows.

<BR><BR>You mean kind of like how it appeared in OS/2, then popped up in Windows 95?  The "start button" taskbar, and most other element of the Windows GUI are not specific to Windows nor did the make their first appearance in that OS.  You'll find that most of the design elements in GUI are basically standard.  They are just implemented slightly different.  Also the comment "Linx does four years later" is rather silly.  Linux is a kernel.  Do you mean Linux based OSes?  Window managers like KDE and GNOME are not specific to Linux.  They can be implemented across all unices.  Hell visit <a href="http://www.shellcity.net/">Shell Extension City</a> to find out about all the replacement shells for Windows.  A good one is <a href="quobeos.com">Qube</a>.

<BR><BR>I believe there are multiple post, diaries, and a mysterious disappearing story along the lines of MS innovations.  So I'll take a page from those.  Please name one innovation in Windows.  Please do, so that I can tell you where it appeared first and what <i>Microsoft</i> copied even <i>years</i> after it was implemented.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Another factor can be the irrelevance of the kind of operating system for the principle of a patented thing. The same thing can be implemented for Linux, for *BSD, for Slowaris or for HP-SUX, or for Windoze if you insist on exchanging stability for true colors.
<BR><BR>
One more, maybe the most important, factor is that people writing Linux code aren't so anally retentive about the so-called "intellectual property" (like it is possible to "own" an idea - it's like owning a wind, or a sunset, or a mood...) and prefer giving their ideas away instead of firewalling them behind lines of lawyers. Software patents should've never been allowed; Europe had it right.
<BR><BR>
There was a patent awarded recently, for <a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-03405.html">swinging sideways</a>. This says something about respectability of the patent office. Heh.
<BR><BR>
On a side note, some time ago I was browsing through patent library, just for fun, and found a program I wrote without any help in a single night infringes on at least half dozen of them; I grew bored then, maybe I'd found much more. When you have patents even on such trivialities like syntax colorizing or displaying of several strings at once in a spreadsheedish array, infringement is just inevitable. What I am expected to do then? Pay and pay and pay, and still tremble with fear that I infringed?

I do believe you are having an internal monologue about something unrelated to proprietary vs Free software driving commercial (as in 'never given away for free', 'intended for profit', etc) gadgets.  Unlike RMS, I dont think the code running my Epson printer is anything other than capitalist infrastructure to sell more Epson printers. It wouldnt make a shred of difference to my Freedom if that software were Free instead of proprietary. 
 Free Software = Expensive Gadgets = Capital Infrastructure = Programmer Decadence. If you dont believe me, check out the stories on the Fortress Freedom Software, Slashdot. No one but a cretinous self-absorbed geek could mistake that site for anything other than an orgy of consumer culture and pathological capitalism. So much for Freedom and The Revolution.

An example from local history. Sometimes around the Revolution, a lot of el-cheapo 9-pin dot matrix printers of one certain brand got between the people. They were without graphics mode, with support only for the characters in their ROMs. Soon, "pirate" EPROMs with requested Kamenicky language norm appeared (cheap, we bought one too). Technically, it was illegal, and required (simple) reverse engineering and editing the character map, and technically it was infringing on the manufacturer's "rights". However, I doubt the manufacturer would be interested in support for already-sold morally obsolete printers. So people became "infringers" because they had to take what they need on their own.
<BR><BR>
I understand that Corporations aren't interested in supplying solutions for markets too small to be fiscally interesting. However, they then should allow the affected people to take the matter to their own hands and help themselves, instead of withholding specifications and forcing them to laborious reverse engineering and then threating them with lawyers when results appear.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The reason Microsoft has those patents is greed, pure and simple.  They want to keep their supposedly original ideas to themselves.  The open-source community wants everything to be shared, and most of its members are not attempting to profit from their work -- so why would they request patents on it?
<BR>

<BR>
Don't try and tell me that among those 2,000 patents, Microsoft hasn't patented some concepts which were originally developed by the open-source community (albeit never patented).
<BR>

<BR>
Besides, software patents are crap.  Most of the software-related patents which have been issued are absolutely bogus.  The Patent Office doesn't have enough software expertise to know which claims are valid or even make sense.  How are they supposed to police the industry in this manner?  It seems that when in doubt, they just go ahead and issue the patent.  This lack of technological expertise causes them to stifle industry innovation, and allows people to obtain patents for ideas which were not originally theirs.
<BR>

<BR>
I'll bet you anything that Microsoft has patents for UI elements which should have belonged to Xerox or Apple -- and that's just one example.

P.S.:  In my spare time tonight, I plan to go through all 2,000 patents and refute them all.  I'll post that point-by-point refutation here by morning.  In fact, while I'm at it, I might as well look at all the patents by other major industry players:  Macromedia, Sun, Apple, Compaq, Adobe, and Symantec, just to name a few.  I should have those refutations available also, by tomorrow.

So what? TCP is Unix's native networking protocol so one expects a (dwindling) Unix presence on the Internet for purely inertial instead of technical reasons. Meanwhile, the overwhelming number of computers connected to the internet are NOT Lunix or another Unix OS. Furthermore, if you performed an <i>honest</i> accounting of traffic, you would discover that Unix is responsible for much less Internet traffic than Windows; it's the difference between visiting as many Unix-hosted sites as you can in a week and downloading 1 warez app off a p2p network.

Why do you have to reboot because of losing of network connection, anyway? Wouldn't restarting the network services be enough? Or is it way too tightly "integrated"? What software you run (or don't run) on it?

I seen a few of stable Windows machines; enough to convince me it is possible they can exist. However, the majority of them is still problematic; maybe because they run more than a very few of applications with more than a few of functions used.

Maybe getting the one application I use the SGI for, scripted up for win2000 would be better than introducing yet another OS for systems to maintain.<BR><BR>
<i>Why do you have to reboot because of losing of network connection, anyway?</i><BR><BR>
Sometimes an attempt to list a remote filesystem will clear the problem, other times not. In general it is quicker to simply restart the machine then go messing about with arcane systems tools. Similarly when the HPUX server sat behind me goes flakey, 3 or 4 times a year, a reboot sorts the thing out. Why waste time pissing about?<BR><BR>
<i>What software you run (or don't run) on it?</i><BR><BR>
Well we are doing high end CADCAM systems development. So compilers, editors, scripting tools, bug tracking software, web browsers, etc, etc. And of course our own software.<BR><BR>
<i>However, the majority of them is still problematic; maybe because they run more than a very few of applications with more than a few of functions used.</i><BR><BR>
Perhaps that is why you don't see too many problems on your Lunix system - precious few applications running on it.

As for the distinction between server and client on the Internet, that distinction is rapidly disappearing.

I just installed Emacs for NT to run Allegro Lisp as an editor process. It sucks on NT. It looks and acts like shit. It doesnt take advantage of any NT or win32 specific features. You know why NT Emacs sucks? Because Open Sauce "programmers" have Lenix so far up their asses, they cant write anything other than Lenix software regardless of the OS. Apparently, if you dont have the source to the kernel, emacs cant be coded correctly. /rolls eyes.

(1) I'm not a microsoftie, I just happen to know Windows is much, much better than Lunix. I take operating systems for granted and unless I'm talking to you advocacy dorks, I dont talk about operating systems at all. (2) I dont judge s/w according to its license.  I'm grateful for gcc and friends as well as the academic work released under open source licenses. However, gnome, kde and 99% of the stuff that comes with a Lunix distribution -- including Lunix, in particular -- is complete crap. Generally, 
Windows apps are always better than their Lunix analogues. This isnt up for debate. However, the very worst thing about Lunix is its users. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

What are you, stupid? Just because Apache can stuff a file down an open socket doesnt mean you know a fucking thing about either Unix or NT. Here's a big fat clue for you: I can boot NT <i>directly</i> into a command line, start Apache and forget about it. Has it escaped your attention how many high profile, large traffic, complex sites run NT?

No. But also it hadn't escaped my attention how many high-profile, large traffic, complex sites run on a flavor of unix.

Whatever an Open Sores programmer decides to program. What do you mean? Win32 calls NT services for it's functionality. If you want to expose the programmer to a different api, write one or buy one. Win32 operates at roughly an intermediary level between unix's posix semantics and clib. Let me ask <i>you</i> your question: when's the last time you ran Linux without clib? The difference is, you can write server apps in NT without win32, although in practice, the subset of process, file and socket win32 calls is done well enough to MOVE ON AND STOP RE-INVENTING THE WHEEL.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Windows2000faq.com - hadn't knew this one, thanks. Maybe I will find there some hints to some of my NT5 (errm... 2k) pains.<br>

<i>The overwhelming majority of security incidents for NT are related to [ie]explorer.exe.</i>
<BR><BR>
Yes, application-level security is bad. But hey, tell me when you seen an email worm that would infect pine?

Most installs are the default ones, without much of additional tunings, with the default vulnerabilities. (Who can afford good admins usually runs unixes anyway.)

(By the way, the registry is an excellent idea excellently implemented. It is much easier to irreparably corrupt /etc than the registry on NT/2000/XP.

<BR><BR>
What is easier than backing up selected parts of the configuration than just tar -xzf etc.tar.gz /etc (or, via scp, even from another machine), and then restore only what I need later by unarchiving only the specific file? Do this on NT. You have 30 seconds.

So now we have 1000 versions of various ways to store registry keys in an single-point-vulnerability closed-format registry file. Oh so fucking great.

Pay attention: when you want users to change the behavior of your app, include an options menu. The registry isnt meant for casual abuse by people who dont know better than to snafu their system.

<BR><BR>
Oh? My experiences show something different.
<BR><BR>
<i>My ISP -- one of the biggest cable ISP's in Canada -- runs NT.</i>
<BR><BR>
The IT infrastructure of bigger subject is usually decision more political than technical. The sales representatives are usually polite but aggressive, and there often are some incentive programs(also called "bribery" by less polite people) for the managers who convince the company to run a given commercial product. I don't know any company that has a choice (ie, doesn't run a mission-critical Windows-only service) and whose management has at least a dash of a clue about computers that runs Windows as a server. I currently serve as a consultant for three people who are upgrading their systems to unix.
<BR><BR>
My ISP runs unix. My employer's ISP (which is at the same time my ISP's upstream) runs unix as well. My former ISP ran unix. My former backup ISP ran unix. Only one local major ISP that I remember from the top of my head runs NT.
<BR><BR>
<i>Most of the sites I visit, and all of the critical internet services I use such as hotmail, also happen to run NT.</i>
<BR><BR>
Hotmail ran on BSD until (and some time after) its acquisition by Microsoft. Most of critical services I am using run a flavor of unix.
<BR><BR>
<i>Understand what all that means. It means the historical accident of TCP on Unix is being unravelled on the Internet because Unix isnt compelling.</i>
<BR><BR>
Oh, so why next to everything I look around here runs on unix?
<BR><BR>
<i>Look, I'm not talking out of school, here. I know Unix better than you do. Every single word Stevens, Kernighan, Nemeth, Snyder, Seebass and Hein have published has been etched into my brain through repeated on the job practice.</i>
<BR><BR>
With mere year of unix admin level I won't argue here. However, I have friends that are between the world's top 1000.
<BR><BR>
<i>When I tell you that I can buy you with one month's salary and that Unix is a rotting corpse, believe me and start thinking about expanding your computing horizons beyond the mythology of Unix.</i>
<BR><BR>
You can't buy me. I am not for sale. Not for the price anyone can afford. I seen both. And if I have to bet my future and livinghood, I will place the bets on unix architecture. (Or more accurately, I will NOT place my bets on Windows.)

Sure? So why wherever I look to, both small and middle companies (I don't see up to the big ones and I am not interested in working for any of them), people are leaving Windows servers in droves? Maybe in Europe people are more resistant to corporate brainwashing. I know where I don't want to go today. Where do you want to go tomorrow?

<i>It's the developers, stupid. Lunix has none compared to Windows, which is why the best parts of Lunix are starting to look like Windows did almost 10 years ago.</i>

Isn't it rather that things are claimed to be stable when they really seem to be stable? Of course, this causes large-scale delays until the "stable" version gets to the market. Besides, second version is usually better (see sendmail vs qmail). It also isn't as bad with the developers as you would wish to believe.
<BR><BR>
Also, there are Windows API emulators, allowing Windows programs run on unixes. Which is a step forward to the fair market where the OS doesn't limit what applications that can run on it. Which also means there will not be "exclusive" agreements between the developers and the OS vendors (especially The One Whose Name Shouldn't Be Spoken).
<BR><BR>
<i>Internally, Lunix is still a dog.</i>
<BR><BR>
You mean that when you treat it well, it will become your best friend? You mean that you can rely on it? You mean it can greatly asssist you? Yes, you are right.
<BR><BR>
On the other hand, if you worry about certain inconsistencies in Linux kernel, *BSD is here for you.

Unpersuaded by their comrades' spectacular bankruptcies, these no longer useful idiots desperately cling to their discredited marketing mantras and quiet, desperate dreams of turning

As someone who had to restore more machines than he'd like to, I say give me a tarball over a System Restore Wizzard any day. The most meaningful difference is that I can be sure the tarball will do its job, even between different OS versions.
<BR><BR>
Registry is an unreliable abomination that nicely symbolizes the impact of Microsoft "innovations"; bloat, slow, and introducing system-wide risks and instability. *spit*
<BR><BR>
I am administering 7 Linux servers and over 35 Windows desktops - which need disproportionate amount of attention, are unstable, and offer no chance of advanced debugging of problems - ie, no gdb, no strace, no source to refer to. The servers typically don't need any care at all, except upgrading and setting up the services (which is easy as I can just scp the configfile from machine to machine, tweak the details - if necessary - and it works! - and in case of frequent changes I can set up replication between the machines, for no additional charges and in few minutes). I managed to recover even from when I screwed a kernel and glibc upgrade. I upgraded kernel on all the machines remotely, without having to visit them; even tried to do so with NT/2k server, without having to babysit it on-site???
<BR><BR>
Now you can continue with your deluded babbling about superiority of droolproof pictures, as the Blue Death eats your work. Feel free to return back when you will learn more.

Truth hurts, yeah? "I shelved out so much money" and "it's a piece of opaque unstable unmaintanable crap" understandably aren't things that people typically want to accept both; I think it is called cognitive dissonance. So go away in peace. And enjoy your next reinstall.

<BR><BR>
I seen too many filesystems (for the purpose of this discussion we will suppose FAT16/FAT32 deserve to be called filesystems, hope NTFS is better) entirely destroyed with Scandisk to believe that Emperor Bill and his bunch of cronies could make any dependable system maintenance tool.
<BR><BR>
<i>It figures, you Lunix hacks all do.</i>
<BR><BR>
At least I can find precisely what process crashes, then run it under a debugger, find where it crashes, look into the source, and correct the offending function (when will the people ever learn to use snprintf instead of sprintf???). Besides, if Billy is so good, tell me how can I get rid of that memory leak in MSIE? At least twice per day I run out of resources, then I have to close all its instances, eventually to kill off a hanging iexplore process, and get most of the resources back for next couple hours. Tell me what options I have to deal with it?
<BR><BR>
I am now heavily playing with multimedia under both Linux and Windows (the aim is to get a platform-independent client side and unixoid server). I had not a single system crash of Linux, and more than dozen of Windows, for only last week. (I had Linux crashes before, under specific circumstances, but after patching the cause - smbfs corrupting dcache tables - I got rid of them completely).

What do you prefer - calling for help and getting it right in 5 minutes, maybe even remotely, maybe together with a smirk that you don't know an arcane command in an arcane text file (oh gods, how shameful!), or calling for help only to be told that it is a registry rot, that there is no easy cure, and that you have to reinstall?
<BR><BR>

<BR><BR>Xerox really didn't play a part in what the guys were doing at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).  Xerox was interested so they sent the researchers out to market it to other investors.  One commonly known instance of this was at IBM.  Rather than speak to any tech guys they spoke to marketing suits.  As soon as they heard of this thing called a mouse they asked them to leave.

<BR><BR>You also seem to forget that Apple marketed a computer with a GUI well before Jobs wents to PARC.  It was marketed for business use but it extremely high price tag made it unattractive.  It was called the Lisa.  You also forget that many elements they used were in the public domain.  They were created by Doug Engelbart.  He's known for such things as the creation of the mouse and first real GUI.  He was also the man who pioneered the idea to direct output to a computer screen.  Before then everything came in the form of a print out.

<BR><BR>You want to know the story?  Ok I'll tell ya.

<BR><BR><b>Apple and Xerox</b>

<BR><BR>Apple did not "rip-off" the Macs UI from Xerox. Apple had hired some people from Xerox (like Jef Raskin, Bruce Horn) who believed in concepts of a Graphical User Interface. These concepts are pretty broad -- like making a computer easier to use by using graphics (icons), using menus, windows and making a consistent interface to do things. The work on these concepts predates Xerox PARC -- in fact it was many of these peoples individual work on those concepts that got them hired at PARC. So Xerox (PARC) brought them together to refine them.

<BR><BR>Apple's work on GUI's predates Steve Jobs visit to Palo Alto Research Center. Apple had already had the same broad goals of offering an easier to use computer, and possibly using some of the same concept (like menus, icons, and graphics).

<blockquote>Remember the following: Icons were not new, we had been using them for years for international street signs and so on -- they were only new on computers. Menus were not new, text based menus were being used and had been for a while. Graphics weren't new, though how much they were relied upon was new. The concepts of User Interface (Human Factors) was not new, it was just a little newer in applying it to computers.</blockquote>

Jef Raskin had worked at Xerox, and he was tooting the "easier to use" trumpet, with his vision of what that meant. He brought some of those ideas from Xerox, but he had brought some of those ideas TO Xerox as well. Later, he convinced Jobs to visit Xerox PARC, and Jobs became an immediate convert (for ease of use).

<blockquote>What Jobs saw at Xerox was a prototype Smalltalk development system. He did not see either a working ALTO or Star (which was developed much later).</blockquote>

<b>Apple paid</b>

<BR><BR>Jobs was so hot on the concepts of UI, and the living Demos he says, that he, later, negotiated a deal with Xerox. He gave Xerox a large sum of stock in Apple (worth Millions) if he could come back, and bring some programmers -- to inspire them more on the concepts of GUI. This was like a one-day tour. This was agreed to by Xerox, and so by no stretch of the imagination could this be called "ripping-off".

<BR><BR>PARC was a research center -- meant to inspire development. But they did not really develop products (in the commercial sense), they developed ideas. Saying that Apple learning some of the base concepts and then applying them was "ripping-off" is like saying that Air-Bags are ripping off Newton -- because Air Bags work because they adhere to some of the laws of physics first expressed by Sir Isaac. A silly silly argument. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Xerox didn't see Apple as competition, that is why they let them in -- but they charged Apple, since Xerox believed that their research had value.

<BR><BR>Apple was creating a product, and so they hired some of the same researchers from Xerox, to be brought to Apple to work on the Mac and Lisa projects. Those researches state quite clearly that the goals and implementation were quite different between Xerox and Apple. The following is an exchange between two of those researchers, and should give you an idea of how much the Mac contributed to the concepts of UI -

<blockquote><em><li><a href="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/ui_horn1.html">  Letter from Bruce Horn on origins of Macs UI</a>
<li><a href="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/ui_raskin.html">Response from Jef Raskin (another Mac founder)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.mackido.com/Interface/ui_horn2.html">Response from Bruce to Raskins Letter</a></em></blockquote>

<BR><BR>The letters do seem to agree that the Macs UI was created at Apple, by Apple and for Apple. And that little if any Xerox work was taken, and the Mac was in a completely different universe. Some broad concepts were in common, but that is about it. Apple furthered those concepts, developed their own, and had totally different implementations.

<BR><BR>The differences in UI between the Xerox UI and Apples' Mac were startlingly different. Years ago I saw a demo of a Alto. From my memory (which may not be flawless), it had a 3 button mouse (which you operated with your right hand), and a chording keyboard (for the left hand). There were overlapping windows, but there was no direct manipulation of those windows. To move the window you selected an option, from the one Menu that you had for each window, and you entered the new size or location of the window into a dialog (using numerical coordinates).There were icons, but icons were not associated with files -- they were more actions (buttons). They were using icons as verbs (do this, or do that) -- Apple made them into nouns, objects (that each represented data) that you manipulated. There wasn't that much direct manipulation, and most of the usage of the multiple windows was so that you could have multiple character terminals (like DOS) open at the same time. Contrast this with a Mac and you see that Apple went way way beyond what they saw.

<blockquote>Xerox extended their developments over time as well, but this is not ripping off. After Apple was far along into the Lisa and Mac project, Xerox had the Star. The Star used many more Mac-like concepts. But many were parallel developed, and some was cross over -- but both machines were developed at the same time but for different goals. I also beleive the Mac is easier to use and has the better interface.</blockquote>

<b>Contrasts</b>

<BR><BR>Jobs kept beating on the Mac people that "Real Artists Ship!" - and that they were making a product. That is not anything like the research atmosphere at Xerox.

<BR><BR>The Mac was 128k based personal computer, based on a Motorola 68000 processor - the MacOS was designed around Pascal with lots of assembly language for size/speed.

<BR><BR>The Xerox machines were anything but personal computers -- they did not use microprocessors (closer to mini-computers), they had no real resource constraints as the Mac did, they ran slower (in real use), were far less elegant, were very immature (yet had some brilliant concepts) and were not really products -- they were research tools. The Xerox Machines were built around SmallTalk (a very resource wasteful language, for the time, but dynamic and powerful).

<BR><BR>The two machines use completely different code and architectures -- which requires completely different software designs. The Mac and the Alto are about as related as a Motorcycle and a Semi-truck -- sure they both have wheels, both are transportation, and both run on roads -- after that it gets pretty divergent.

<blockquote>Note: There is not a single line of code that Apple got from Xerox, nor could have since the languages and designs of the system were so radically different.</blockquote>

<b>Apple and Microsoft</b>

<BR><BR>Now what happened with Microsoft?

Well it starts out that Microsoft was one of the first Application Developers for the Mac. Apple (Jobs) knew that the Mac needed Software to be commercially viable, and Jobs learned that Microsoft was trying to break in to the Application market (1).

<blockquote>(1) Few remember that MS made languages. Then later sold operating systems (MSDOS) which they didn't own (they licensed 86-DOS (called QDOS by its creator) from Seattle Computer Company, sold it to IBM as their own work, and a few years later bought the rights to 86-DOS).  And it wasn't until the Mac that they started making Applications. The Mac was Microsoft's chance to break into the lucrative Application markets. (Microsoft had made a few feeble attempts before the Mac, but it was the Mac that made them successful in the application area. They knew that a new computer meant new opportunities.</blockquote>

Jobs showed Microsoft the early Mac prototypes. Gates liked the ideas and agreed to write Mac applications.

<BR><BR>Gates later threatened to pull their apps at the last minute before release unless Jobs agreed to -

<blockquote>A) Apple had to license some of the MacUI for MS-Applications on the PC. This Application suite later grew into Windows 1.0 and Office. Remember, Windows started off as an Application Suite, not an OS-Shell (2).</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote>(2) Because Apple had licensed some concepts to Microsoft (under coercion), it weakened their case later against MS when MS started more blatantly ripping off the Mac. Contrary to popular myth that Apple lost their lawsuit against MS because it wasn't a rip-off, the real reason was that they had been to vague in their licensing of some technologies, and the benefit of the doubt was given to MS.</blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>B) Apple had to drop their MacBasic project which was completed and better than MS Basic. MacBasic had many concepts that MS ripped off to create VisualBasic. What few ideas for VB that MS didn't rip off from MacBasic they got from HyperCard -- which Bill Atkinson wrote because the Mac didn't have a good simple programming environment, because MS had dropped their basic for the Mac and had forced MacBasic to canceled as well.</blockquote>

Later MS decided that the GUI was just too cool not to use. So they started on an Application Suite that would use the Macs concepts of Windows, a Mouse, and direct manipulation to achieve its ends. This became Windows 1.0, and evolved into the Windows we know and hate today. The lead programmer for the Windows project was the same guy who had been a lead programmer for writing the Mac Application projects.

<BR><BR>This sequence of events (Microsoft "borrowing" the Mac interface) is not the same as taking rough concepts and adding to them to create your own system -- this is much more intimate than that. Microsoft took their best Mac Programmer, and had him making almost every design decision for early windows. He was told, by Bill Gates, to make a PC look and work, "JUST like a Mac" -- this is a direct quote from Gates! Contrast that sequence of events, to Apple and Xerox sequence of events, and you get an idea for the difference in philosophy and implementation. Microsoft stole, Apple expanded.

<BR><BR>This similarity was (of Windows to MacOS) is not just in design, there are whole toolboxes/API that are almost identical (in interface). Microsoft stole data structures and many routines, and the names and concepts for many things are the same as well. If it wasn't for the fact that they had to hack their stuff on top of DOS, they likely would have just stolen all the same code (and they did get sued for that later as well). If you look at many of the older Windows routines you see names and structures that are identical to the Mac. But MS is smart enough to avoid (or win) lawsuits -- they changed one name out of 10, or re-ordered a few things, all so they could say it wasn't identical. MS also had to make some design changes to get it to run on a PC. But as far as real design work for Windows, there was none -- the Mac was a living design document.

<BR><BR>At first, MS only ripped off the design and implementation, but stayed away from Apple's look and feel. They knew that Apple would only tollerate so much theft. Later MS crossed this line as well, and Apple sued. It was when they started to steal the desktop metaphor (folders, trashcan, etc.) that Apple had enough. No matter what the legal decisions are, ethically Microsoft ripped off the Mac.

<blockquote>Later (post 1995) Microsoft has started to put some money into R&D, and they may try to innovate. Up to this point, they did not innovate -- they may rework others ideas, or add features to, but that's not "true" innovation.</blockquote>

<b>Conclusions</b>

<BR><BR>Apple did not rip-off the Alto (Xerox-Parc) -- how could they? Apple was a product oriented company that produced a computer on their own. That computer had a few similarities in concept (user interface) with stuff Xerox was doing, but almost NOTHING in common design or implementation. Apple's metaphors went way way beyond what Xerox was doing (though there are other areas where Xerox was beyond Apple). They were trying to achieve different goals -- and from different points of view. Apple was creating the ultimate personal computer. Xerox was doing research tools, and later tried to make a big client-server type document distribution systems. These are about as similar as a motorcyle and a commuter Bus.

<BR><BR>Microsoft on the other hand did rip-off Apple. The concept of making a computer easy to use is way to broad to protect, and Apple didn't complain about that. Windows, icons and menus are not ripping Apple off either -- these are broad concepts. Microsoft got sued because they stole design, implementation and finally metaphors (look and feel). They stole the way you manipulate things on the computer -- as well as almost everything underneath. I sometimes swear that if Microsoft had an original thought the company would immediately implode in surprise. Almost Everything good in Windows can be traced directly to the Mac (which the Mac had years before) -- and almost everything bad in Windows can be traced directly to where MS tried to do things different than the Mac and proved they don't know what they hell they are doing.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>

As Gates said to Jobs <i>"Hey, Steve, just because you broke into Xerox's house before I did and took the TV doesn't mean I can't go in later and take the stereo"</i><BR><BR>
The fact remains that throughout the 80's Apple threw its financial weight around, threatening smaller companies and stiffling inovation.<BR><BR>
Some may think that RMS and the FSF's years of punishment of MacOS users for Apple's behaviour was a bit unfair, but feeling ran high in those days and Microsoft was thought of as the hero. Now apparently, the history books have been rewritten.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I've found the best solution to your registry woes.  GET RID OF WINDOWS!  If that's not a option than I suggest picking up <a href="http://find.pcworld.com/21381">EasyCleaner</a>.  If you're like me then you have likely had peobelms after downloading RegClean from Microsoft.  It crashes and burns everytime.

<BR><BR>However, EasyCleaner is the best tool I have found.  I used to use Noroton Clean sweep but it does a rather poor job.  When checking for duplicate files it doesn't offer many optpions.  So if you have to programs that both use two different images called 1.bmp it will flag them both.  EasyCleaner checks CRC.

<BR><BR>Anther good utility is Clean System Directory.  You should find it <a href="http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/">here</a>.  Trust me they work.  Run any Microsoft utility then these and you'll be amazed.  For example I ran Disk CleanUP (MS).  It's supposed to remove Temporary Files.  Imagine my shock after running EasyCleaner (opting to skip Hidded, Read-Only, and System Files, in Options for Unnecessary Files).  After Cleaning the registry and removing everything Disk CleanUp missed I gained about 30MB of space on my test machine.

<BR><BR>One last program is Diskeeper (www.execsoft.com).  They even include a link to the MS support pages which state that for best results you should use a third party defragmenter.

<BR><BR>Wow, I had to download or buy all that third party software to do stuff Windows is supposed to.  But if you're going to keep Windows they're well worth it.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Please show where it's listed as MSHTML.  It's rather funny because the independent standards organisation the World Wide Web Constorium (W3C) as well as every friggin text lists it as HTML.  You still haven;t explain your stupidity of mistaking it for a protocol.

<BR><BR>Maybe you were thinking of MSTCP/MSIP.  Many years ago (around the release of Windows 3.1) Microsoft to make proprietary extensions to TCP/IP in a move it thought would standardize computing and the internet by eventually forcing people to use Windows to use the internet.  Amazingly the W3C and every corporation told Microsoft to fuck off.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>
