		<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/82announce.php">Today saw the release</a> of the latest and greatest version of the Lunix
operating system, Lunix Mandrake 8.2. Although "alternative" operating
systems are not usually of interest to <a href="../index.html">Adequacy</a>'s readership, who prefer to
trust user-friendly commercial software, this release is noteworthy. For
the release of Lunix Mandrake 8.2, aggressively timed to coincide with
the UK launch of Microsoft's much vaunted <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/">X Box</a>, marks the start
of the final battle for domination of the computer industry. Make no
mistake, the next few months will either see Microsoft tighten its
stranglehold on the marketplace or will be a coming of age for the upstart
Lunix operating system.<p> Considering the enormous significance of this
release, we at Adequacy are proud to bring you the first ever
review of Lunix Mandrake 8.2.<p>
<b>[editor's note, by iat: Please let's not have a repeat of the unfortunate incidents that followed my last review of Lunix, in which various death threats and legal threats were made, together with attempts to hack the Adequacy.org server. Thank you]</b>        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">The Lunix operating system was born in 1991 and was created by one man, a
Finnish student named Axl Torvalds. Since these humble
beginnings, a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=lnux&d=v1">multi-million dollar</a>
industry has sprung up to exploit the commercial potential of Lunix, but
until recently Lunix has eluded mainstream acceptance. However, due to the
recent economic downturn together with uncertainty over changes to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>'s pricing policy, Lunix is
now being touted as a serious contender to Microsoft Windows. While there
are many other alternatives to Windows, including <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">BSD</a> which is based on <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>'s server-grade Solaris operating system,
none have commanded the same level of media attention as Lunix.<p>
<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com">Lunix Mandrake</a> is just the
latest in a long line of quirkily christened versions of Lunix. Previous
versions of Lunix have been named <i>Red Hat</i>, <i>Slack Ware</i>,
<i>Storm</i> and <i>Coral</i>. In stark contrast to the mundane names such
as <i>98</i>, <i>ME</i> or <i>NT</i> preferred by Microsoft, the crazy
names of each Lunix release hint at its renegade nature.<p>

My foray into the world of Lunix began by downloading a "CD image" from
the Lunix web site. But don't worry, this isn't software piracy, it's
perfectly legal! Lunix is shareware, meaning that it can be freely
redistributed without fear of a visit by the <a href="http://www.bsa.org">Business Software Alliance</a>.  The free
availability of Lunix is a major reason for its popularity among
cash-strapped students, criminals and self-styled <a href="http://www.fsf.org">anti-capitalist hackers</a>.<p>

Before installing new software, it is always advisable to read the
documentation. Unfortunately, an unpleasant surprise was in store for me
in the "required configuration" section of the <a href="ftp://jungle.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/mandrake/Mandrake/8.1/i586/INSTALL.txt">manual</a>.  
I was shocked to learn that Lunix Mandrake only runs on Pentium
processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old <a href="http://www.gateway.com">Gateway</a> 486 were dashed. Furthermore, a
whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Lunix! Although the <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">advocates</a> of Lunix self-righteously
boast the efficiency of their chosen operating system and deride the
"bloatware"  produced by Microsoft, it appears that their claims are
blatantly incorrect. Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95,
it seems that Lunix requires far more powerful, and more expensive,
computer hardware. Is this really a sign of a lean, mean operating system?  
Of course not.<p>

Sadly, not even being able to install Lunix is just the first of my many
complaints about Lunix. A brief perusal of the <a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/company/press/pr?n=/pr/products/1227">
features of Lunix Mandrake</a> reveals that Lunix is sorely lacking many
crucial productivity applications. For example, why isn't the industry
standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Lunix?  Despite the
best efforts of the experts at the <a href="http://www.ietf.org">Internet
Engineering Task Force</a> to encourage adoption of the Internet Explorer
standard, the creators of Lunix seem to think that they know better. By
refusing to adhere to recognised standards, Lunix is simply undermining
its own credibility.<p>

Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software 
is completely incompatible with Lunix! It may surprise you to learn that 
your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express or Lotus Notes will not 
work under Lunix. Those who wish to use their computer for recreational 
purposes are also out of luck, for almost all of the most popular games 
are unavailable for Lunix. Although a wide range of software is freely 
available for Lunix, these are mostly unfinished and unreliable and do not 
bear comparison to their commercial counterparts.<p>

Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by
the developers of Lunix. In these times where hacking and viruses are
commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no <a href="http://www.mcafee.com">anti-virus software</a> is available for
Lunix. To add insult to injury, there is no Lunix version of the popular
<a href="http://www.zonealarm.com">ZoneAlarm</a> firewall. By using Lunix, 
you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the 
Internet.<p>

The shortcomings of Lunix are obvious. Without even installing Lunix
Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws. Surely it is not too
much to expect that, after ten years of development, the creators of Lunix
would have addressed these problems? The real question that the
prospective Lunix user must ask himself is, "Why bother?" After all,
Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need
to replace it, particularly not with a product of inferior quality such as 
Lunix.<p>

Although it is always tempting to support the underdog, Microsoft's X-Box will 
be the deserved victor in the battle ahead. I recommend that all
Adequacy readers rush out to buy an X-Box, rather than foolishly 
wasting their time, money and effort on Lunix.       <br><br></div>

About a month ago I attempted to install the latest release of <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Devian</a> <a href="http://gnu.org">Lenix</a> on my <a href="http://compaq.com">Compaq</a> iPaq desktop PC with a 1.2Ghz <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a> <a href="http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/">Pentium 4</a> processor, 256k of <a href="http://dodge.com">RAM</a>, a <a href="http://logitech.com">Logitech web camera</a>, and <a href="http://hp.com">HP</a> laserjet printer. This machine is my only PC, but I though I would take a shot at turning it into a <a href="support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q243/8/96.ASP">dual boot</a> system. I got a great deal on this computer from <a href="http://cdw.com">CDW</a>. My employer buys quite a bit from them I guess, because they offer all of our employees hefty discounts. I think I paid around $1300 for the whole kit and caboodle maybe six months ago. It really is a great computer, looks good, nice and compact, legacy free, came with the web camera and printer. I wanted all the bells and whistles and I'm pretty sure I got them. Top of the line all the way.<BR><BR>

Now, I'm not a full blown geek, but I know my computers. All of my friends come to me when they have a computer problem and I'm always able to figure out exactly what they should do (even if its 'Take it to the experts at <a href="http://bestbuy.com">Best Buy's</a>'). For some reason, I was totally lost with <a href="http://www.soften.ktu.lt/~kaleck/Lenin">Lenix</a>.<BR><BR>

I think it installed properly. I put the <a href="http://sony.com">CD</a> (that I downloaded and burned with my <a href="http://microsoft.com">Windows 2000</a> operating system mind you) in and followed the few on screen instructions that came up. Incidentally, why is the installation so boring? I have installed <a href="http://microsoft.com">Windows 98</a> before, it shows me all sorts of <a href="http://kodak.com">pictures</a> and tells me all about what Windows can do for me, Devian Lenix did none of this. Anyway, it installed, I think. When the machine rebooted it asked me for a name and password, which I dutifully provided. Things were looking good at this point. Nice security, asking for a password (although it did not require me to <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codec/codeci/ctc/events/win2k.pdf">CTRL-ALT-DEL</a> like <a href="http://microsoft.com">Windows 2000</a>, which keeps my password secure, points off for that).<BR><BR>

After that, things went <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">downhill</a>.<BR><BR>

I was presented with a prompt, something that looked very DOS-like. I think it was \root or something. I figured that I could type something like DIR to see what sort of files I had access to. Nope. Nothing. The operating system did not function as it should have. No file list, no disk information, no nothing.<BR><BR>

To make a long story short, my MBR was totally destroyed and one my my memory cards was corrupted. I found this out when I reinstalled <a href="http://microsoft.com">Windows 2000</a> (which the Lenix installation broke). My Compaq Recovery CD informed me that my MBR was ruined but that it could fix it, thanks to Microsoft tools provided with the CD. Luckily, I escaped this disaster with having to replace only a memory card. You might have to replace your entire PC! Never again will I mess around with any sort of Lenix, at least until it comes with some sort of guarantee, backed up by a <a href="http://disney.com">solid company</a> that I can <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">trust</a>.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Using a bootdisk or the utilities on the CD you burn simply type FDISK/MBR.  Of course you could just reinstall Windows because it overwirtes the MBR evertime it installs.

<BR><BR><b>and one my my memory cards was corrupted.</b>

<BR><BR>Then don't stick Playstation memory cards into your computer.  Use memory modules dummy.  Also memory does not become corrupted.  It's temporary storage that clears when you turn off the computer.  If it was damaged it would have been a hardware fault.  Software no matter how bad does not do this.  Simply reinstalling Windows wouldn't have fixed it.  If the module was bad no software can fix it.  It's hardware and must be replaced.

that is the most uninformed, unsubstantiated, shallow and retarded "experience" of Linux I have ever read!!! You make out that it totally screwed your PC over.... Linux didn't damage your PC, you are just too stupid to sit and work out what it did do. If I was one of your so-called "friends" I certainly wouldn't come to you for any computer advice....

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Linux is not designed to be another window (although Lindows now runs windows apps). Like UNIX, which is the most trusted, and secure software in the server market, Linux has a different code base, there is no reason for it to run MS Office or alike, it has its own versions, like star office (SUN), which must be inferior, especially since the British Government has left MS Office, for it. And one of the only reasons MS is not compatible, is because they want to eliminate all competition, and make their software that way.
<BR>

<BR>
Also whilst Linux is daily becoming more user friendly (distros like Red Hat), it is still designed for more advanced computer users, if you have problems running/installing this software you are clearly not in this category. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you look at specialty computers, and power computers alike you'll see very few of them run Windows. Windows is an OS for the masses, if you do serious work with computers, be it programming, graphic design, or 3D animation you chose a MAC, IRIX (SGI/Unix), or Linux (now also used in SGI's comps). 
<BR>

<BR>
Also it is a fact that *nix OS's are less system intensive than MS OS's (which is why they were used in the making of movies like Shrek). You compare your latest version of Linux to a 7 year old version of Windows. In reality 32 MB of ram is tiny these days, I'd like to see you get XP to work on your stone age 486, or on a Pentium 1 for that matter; wait even better a Pentium 2. By the way what are the requirements for XP. Also Linux is free, how is it being exploited? And there is plenty of anti-virus software available for Linux, however unlike windows; it is rarely needed, as it is far more secure.
<BR>

<BR>
You find proof of your beliefs about Linux, because it's what you want to believe. If you took a step back and looked at things rationally, and as they are, you'd see that while Linux may not be the OS for you, it still is a worthy contender for MS (unless you like being under the eye of big brother), and like the rest of the MS alternatives, for those who know what there doing it has many advantages.

That's a fallacious argument. Microsoft have spent years developing and testing the XP codebase, and XP builds upon the experience that Microsoft have gained while producing all the previous versions of Windows (and from producing software since the 1970s). By your logic, I could claim that Linux has been rushed out of the door, since the 2.4.18 kernel has only been around for a month.<BR><BR>

Let me ask you a question, which I'd like you to answer honestly: Have you used Windows XP (or even Windows 2000) for any significant length of time? Or have you just seen screenshots of XP on ZDnet and formed a negative opinion based on your prejudices and the propaganda of the Linux community?

Hey - it's apparently okay for the commercial software manufacturers to "borrow"! Microsoft's only original invention is the Paperclip. So if the Big Players can "borrow" freely from the small players, what's wrong on small players "borrowing" back from the big ones?

Case by case. If I like something and can't run it as I want to, I rewrite it or port it. Simple.
<BR><BR>
<i>It's a much more difficult task to think of a single piece of open source software that is both well designed and innovative.</i>
<BR><BR>
Well-designed is more important than innovative. I have no problems with devices - both software and hardware - that are built in borrowed ideas or are copies of something other - as long as they are reliable and dependable.
<BR><BR>
Sendmail was innovative for its time, but became a monster. Then qmail came, copied the functionality that was essential, threw away obsolete parts like UUCP support, and became a well-engineered "knockoff". Guess what one I run. Four servers, half year, not a single problem.

<BR><BR>BASIC.  When people think of it they general reach 2 conclusions.  One is that Bill Gates is a programming genious and the Microsoft innovates.  Both are incorrect.  PAul Allen did most of the coding for BASIC while Gates handled the marketing.  Everything from DOS to Windows is built using licensed, licensed then made incomptible, stolen, or existing code.

<BR><BR>I don't have to remind you of how MS licensed QDOS and licensed it to IBM as their own for 2 or more years before actually buying the rights to it.  I probably don't need to remind you of how Internet Explorer was built using licensed Mosaic code with incompatible extensions.  Even the name Internet Explorer was a <a href="http://www.toad.net/~andrews/msspeak.html">copyright infringement</a>.  Let's examine some more shall we?

<BR><BR><b>1.</b>  Apple successfully sued MS for ripping them off.  Through interpretation of the language used in the contract negotiated between the two parties MS continued to copy Apple.<br>
<b>2.</b>  Quarterdeck developed QEMM.  Microsoft used the step in its own memory tool for DOS.   They convinced Quaterdeck that they should develop a smaller shell for Windows 95.  Unfortuantely MS already had contracts with PC manufacturers forbidding them from loading any such product.  Windows also had a bug in which if there was a directory on the hard drive called QEMM Windows would crash and become unusable.<br>
<b>3.</b>  STAC Electronics developed a hard-disk compression scheme that allowed PCs to store 1.5 to 2.5 as much data on a hard drive.  Microsoft copied this code and embedded it into MSDOS 6.0 as "DoubleSpace." Microsoft was found liable in civil court and later paid $83 million in damages, according to reports on the case.<br>
<b>4.</b>  Tiny company Go Corp. invented pen-based computing in the early 1990s. When invited to consider selling its technology to Microsoft, Go gladly agreed to have a "marketing guy" from Microsoft examine the product. Instead, several Microsoft programmers -- who many say were pretending to be marketers -- spent three days poring over every detail of the source code for Go's flagship product. Then they pronounced it a dud and left town. Six months later, Microsoft began offering a similar product using Go's approach -- and dared Go to sue them. Next thing you know, Go went bankrupt and disappeared.<br>
<b>5.</b>  Sun Microsystem licensed Java to MS for use in Windows.  MS modified the Java code and develop an incompatible version of the RE.  Microsoft called this the Microsoft Java Runtime Environment.  Sun sued MS for $1 billion.  They have launched another case against MS for continuing to offer and market the MS JavaRE which it is forbidden to do as they dropped Java support after the case ended.  sun had offered them a choice.  MS could continue utilizing Java in Windows according to the license or not at all.

<BR><BR>We could list hundreds of similar cases -- the strangling of Netscape via product giveaways, the disappearance of applications for Mac OS and OS/2 when Microsoft refused to provide development tools it had sold to independent developers, the booby-trapped code in Windows 3.1 to target DR-DOS, using BSD code or developing incompatible extensions to Kerberos -- but time does not permit a full list with descriptions of all the alleged wrongs.

<BR><BR>Now I'm not going to solely attack Microshaft here. Most of the software today is simply imporvement on open source or public domain software.  Not all of it is innovative.  Sometimes you just need to scrap the old one and rewrite it all over again (Sendmail/qmail).  The true <b>innovators</b> have long since faded from public view or passed away.

<BR><BR>Most people will never know of the innovative hackers from the 60s and 70s. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

You are intentionally confounding the innovative use of technology with entirely new and patentable technology. Open Source is not responsible for any of the latter, unless you consider research open source. But why would you do that, read your myopia back into the contingent facts of history?
Innovations from research are usually privately funded and almost always pursued to satisfy some corporate strategy. Let me make this clearer for you: no one *using* Lunix has ever innovated and certainly nothing in Lunix or under the GPL is innovative by your definition of innovative or mine.
<BR><BR>
NOTHING. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

Richard Stallman and the FSF/OSS talking heads could have easily never been born for all the difference they've made. When will you realize that actual software is IRRELEVANT compared to the academic ideas that eventually find expression in software (much to the indifference of their original academic authors), and that the word 'innovation' appears nowhere in any software license?

Stop lying to me, trying to get me to purchase products that don't exist.  Is that S.P.A.M.?  You sir, appear to be nothing more than a S.P.A.M.mer, which is evil.  And you have the nerve to call my truthful counterarguments evil.  You disgust me.
<BR><BR>
<b>A wise man knows he is not wise</b>
<BR><BR>
Your words are nonsensical.  By your logic, if a man is wise, he know that he is not wise.  But if he knows he is not wise he is either (1) not wise, or (2) incorrect.  Your faulty and circular logic won't stand here on <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a>, I guarantee it.
<BR><BR>
<b>Also why dose [sic] everyone on this site refer to people as Sir, and friend?</b>
<BR><BR>
You sir, are obvisously new to Adequacy.  If you were more familliar with a web forum that wasn't full of trolls, you would realize that such language is a way to discuss something in a non-controntational manner.  Plus, it's more polite.
<BR><BR>
<b>I also use both XP and 2000, and I have compared them to various distros [sic] (which I have taken the time to learn properly), I am sure you have not, so how can we possibly see you as an authority. Because someone told you?</b>
<BR><BR>
Well, my clients pay me good money, and consider me an authority -- is that not good enough for you?  Besides, as I've already told you, I don't need to do an in-depth examination and delve into the world of hackers and criminals.  Further, I can rely on the experts at <a href="../index.html">Adequacy.org</a> to do the investigation for me.
<BR><BR>
<b>How can you say something like this, just after claiming to do serious work with computers, and just before calling your self [sic] educated? </b>
<BR><BR>
The answer is simple my friend:  instead of wasting my valuable billable time on computers programs thrown together by hackers, I spend my time <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/press">learning</a> and building valuable business solutions for my clients.  I don't bother myself with abbreviations and acronyms that are useless.   I have read your translations despite the difficulty of correcting your poor spelling.  Is English your first language sir?  I dare hope not!  Regardless, I have discerned the truth hidden behind the tangled mess of words.
<li>MAC:  You are no doubt referring to the toy computer systems produced by Apple Computer Corporation.  No serious professional would be caught dead with a lemon-lime flavoured computer.  
<li>IRIX:  A version of Lunix from a now-defunct dot-com hacker company?  I'm not really clear about this.
<li>comps:  A shortened version of the word "<i>computers</i>"?  I'm sorry that I'm not familliar with your "l33t" computer lingo, I'd rather be working then chatting with hackers.
<li>Lindows:  This appears to be yet another version of your infamous Lunix.  Except with this "company" it seems that it has undisputably infringed on Microsoft valuable Intellectual Property.  I suppose nothing more could be expected from a group of hackers, but I'm disapointed that anyone would dare suggest that an honest business professional like myself would consider using it.
<BR><BR>
In closing, here is a partial list of the spelling and grammatical errors found throughout your comment:  <b>words which (should be <i>words that</i>), Micro$oft, Fox Pro, your self, dose, there (should be <i>their</i>), coppied, intelect, abreviations, intelect, your self (again!), and Distrabutions. </b>
<BR><BR>
I would suggest that you use a legitimate word processor such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/word">Microsoft Word</a> to correct this.  Amongst its many features is the ability to automatically correct your spelling and grammar <i>while you type</i>.  Further, you must cease with using hacker lingo such as LOL. If you hope to continue this conversation, I expect a higher standard of quality.

<b>"One does not have to sleep with the devil in order to discern that she is evil."</b><br><br>

How do you know that the devil is evil? or that it even exists? or that it is a she? Are you prone to making your own facts. Or do you believe blindly in anything written.<br><br><br>


<b>"I know that certain things are wrong, and don't desire to embrace them in order to prove it to you."</b> <br><br>

You are scared to admit defeat aren't you? So, how is it that you know, open source is "wrong"? From the trust worthy members of this site by chance.<br><br><br>

Why do you assume open source and *nix to be directly linked to hackers and criminals? I suppose most of the largest organizations in the world must be hackers and criminals then. Since SUN is the server software of choice.<br><br><br>


<b>"computers programs thrown together by hackers"</b><br><br>

<b>"MAC: You are no doubt referring to the toy computer systems produced by Apple Computer Corporation. No serious professional would be caught dead with a lemon-lime flavoured computer."</b><br><br>

<b>"IRIX: A version of Lunix (you mean Unix) from a now-defunct dot-com hacker company? I'm not really clear about this."</b><br><br>

Thank you ]</b>

<BR><BR>Well posiibly if you could write an intelligent review you wouldn't have to worry now would you?  Let's examine some points of interest shall we?

<BR><BR><b>For the release of Lunix Mandrake 8.2, aggressively timed to coincide with the UK lanuch of Microsoft's much vaunted X Box, marks the start of the final battle for domination of the computer industry.</b>

<BR><BR>You comparing the realease of an operating system to the release of a video game console!?!  And why does your link point to WindowsXP?  The XBox has nothing to do with XP.  Microsoft has stated many times that it uses the W2K kernel.  Can you say Duh?  This just throws off your entire review and makes you look extremely stupid and uniformed in the process.

<BR><BR><b>The Lunix operating system was born in 1991 and was created by one man, a Finnish student named Axl Torvalds.</b>

<BR><BR>Don't you mean Linus Torvalds?

<BR><BR><b>However, due to the recent economic downturn together with uncertainty over changes to Microsoft's pricing policy, Lunix is now being touted as a serious contender to Microsoft Windows.</b>

<BR><BR>Finally some intelligence, yet....

<BR><BR><b>While there are many other alternatives to Windows, including BSD which is based on Sun's server-grade Solaris operating system, none have commanded the same level of media attention as Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>I believe you have that back-asswards.  Solaris is based of BSD.  FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD are also based on the original BSD (Berkeley Systems Distribution).

<BR><BR><b>Lunix Mandrake is just the latest in a long line of quirkily christened versions of Lunix. Previous versions of Lunix have been named Red Hat, Slack Ware, Storm and Coral. In stark contrast to the mundane names such as 98, ME or NT preferred by Microsoft, the crazy names of each Lunix release hint at its renegade nature.</b>

<BR><BR>Not this again?  Linux is a kernel.  Versions of Linux are expressed numerically (ie 2.5.xx).  Think of the Windows kernel (kernel32, NTkernel, etc).  Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake are ditributions put out by <i>different</i> entities.  Some of them are commercial such as Red Hat Inc, Mandrakesoft (MacMillan) etc.  Is it <i>that</i> difficult?

<BR><BR><b>My foray into the world of Lunix began by downloading a "CD image" from the Lunix web site.</b>

<BR><BR>I believe you mean Mandrake's website as their is no Linux website.  well, at least no official website as Linux is not a company nor is it owned by any company or organisation.  Not even the Free Software Foundation or the GNU Project own Linux.

<BR><BR><b>But don't worry, this isn't software piracy, it's perfectly legal! Lunix is shareware, meaning that it can be freely redistributed without fear of a visit by the Business Software Alliance. The free availability of Lunix is a major reason for its popularity among cash-strapped students, criminals and self-styled anti-capitalist hackers.</b>


<BR><BR>Linux is not shareware.  Shareware is not open source nor does it include source code either.  Shareware is also limited in the ability to use the product without payment or activation.  One more thing.  It's not freeware either.

<BR><BR><b>I was shocked to learn that Lunix Mandrake only runs on Pentium processors, meaning that my hopes of testing the water with my old Gateway 486 were dashed.</b>

<BR><BR>It seems you simply did a cut a paste from your last review which was picked apart for being completely WRONG.  Unfortunately, there is not CD images available from non Pantium processors.  If you want one however, you should have considered a different distribution.  Might I suggest Red Hat 7.2 (see above if you still haven't got that version thing figured out yet).  I mean you're pretty stupid to have downloaded and the i586 for use ona 486 system.  Hell, you could always grap Mandrake 7.0 for your old 486.  Duh.

<BR><BR><b>Furthermore, a whopping 32 megabytes of memory are required to run Lunix! Although the advocates of Lunix self-righteously boast the efficiency of their chosen operating system and deride the "bloatware" produced by Microsoft, it appears that their claims are blatantly incorrect. Although my humble 486 will happily run Windows 95, it seems that Lunix requires far more powerful, and more expensive, computer hardware. Is this really a sign of a lean, mean operating system? Of course not.</b>

<BR><BR>Linux itself requires very little to run.  Combine that with various utilities and applications you need more.  You could always limit what you install as you likely will not need everything.  You're compare a complete OS with a kernel.  Again the kernel requires very little.  Hell the Windows kernels would likely not require that much.  Wanna see how much bloat is in Windows?  Download a different shell to replace explorer.exe then run the resource agent in Windows.  DAMN! Another thing.  You're comparing a full feature recent OS to an outdate one (Win95).  Wow!  The bare minimum runs slower than crap requirements for WindowsXP are 64MB.  Think about that.

<BR><BR><b>Sadly, not even being able to install Lunix is just the first of my many complaints about Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>Whose fault is that?  Yours for not downloaded the correct CD image or choosing a different distro with one availble for you system.

<BR><BR><b>A brief perusal of the features of Lunix Mandrake reveals that Lunix is sorely lacking many crucial productivity applications. For example, why isn't the industry standard web browser, Internet Explorer, included with Lunix?</b>


<BR><BR>Gee I dunno, probably the same reason iTunes (MacOS) doesn't run on Windows.  Use your head and think about that some more.  Besides if you want standards get Mozilla.  

<BR><BR><b>Despite the best efforts of the experts at the Internet Engineering Task Force to encourage adoption of the Internet Explorer standard, the creators of Lunix seem to think that they know better. By refusing to adhere to recognised standards, Lunix is simply undermining its own credibility.</b>

<BR><BR>If you wanna talk more about standard you don't go to the IETF.  You go to the big boys.  That's right the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  They have continually spoken against Microsoft for taking standards and applying incompatible extensions.  If you want a standard we browser certified and developed by the W3C then get Amaya from their web site.

<BR><BR><b>Similarly, almost all of the world's most popular and widely used software is completely incompatible with Lunix! It may surprise you to learn that your copy of Microsoft Office, Outlook Express or Lotus Notes will not work under Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>Kind like how your copy of MS OfficeXP won't run on any other platform like MacOS.  No, you have to buy MS Office v.X.  And you are limiting your argument to desktop software.  What about server software?  All Unix apps and utilities can easily be ported to Linux with little to no modification.

<BR><BR><b>Computer security is also an area that seems to have been overlooked by the developers of Lunix. In these times where hacking and viruses are commonplace, it defies belief to learn that no anti-virus software is available for Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>Symmantec (Norton Anti-Virus) readily makes virus discovery and removal tools availble for Unix/Linux.  It has for quite some time.

<BR><BR><b>To add insult to injury, there is no Lunix version of the popular ZoneAlarm firewall. By using Lunix, you are issuing an open invitation to the hordes of ne'er-do-wells on the Internet.</b>

<BR><BR>Because ZoneAlarm sucks.  BlacICE is much better.  However, why would you download these if say WindowsXP includes a built in firewall?  Most Linux distro include their own firewall or are configured solely as firewalls.

<BR><BR><b>The shortcomings of Lunix are obvious. Without even installing Lunix Mandrake, I have exposed several fundamental flaws. Surely it is not too much to expect that, after ten years of development, the creators of Lunix would have addressed these problems? The real question that the prospective Lunix user must ask himself is, "Why bother?" After all, Microsoft Windows comes free with most PCs and there simply isn't a need to replace it, particularly not with a product of inferior quality such as Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>Blah blah blah.  Your last review was picked apart for stupidity and now this one has been too.

<BR><BR><b>Although it is always tempting to support the underdog, Microsoft's X-Box will be the deserved victor in the battle ahead. I recommend that all Adequacy readers rush out to buy an X-Box, rather than foolishly wasting their time, money and effort on Lunix.</b>

<BR><BR>Yes, and I will laugh when you try to load OfficeXP on your new game console.  Duh!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>I seriously doubt that.  These guys aren't that smart.  Mention Luna or Aqua and you'll end up reading through anti-hacker rhetoric.  Most of these guys think Luna and Aqua and such are nothing but hacker tools.  At least until you explain it to them.  The whole Lunix thing started before the release of XP and before the GUI was officially name Luna.

<BR><BR>So you wanna do the who copied who.  Very well.

<BR><BR>Windows GUIs copy Mac (and OS/2, see below).  Apple used ideas from Lisa and reasearch team at Palo Alto.  Douglas Engelbart went to work for Palo Alto.  Engelbart developed first advanced windowing system and GUI.  Unix had a windowing system.  Linux combines everything from all of them plus some new features.  You don't see virtual desktop in Windows do you?  Well, at least not without third party software.

<BR><BR>Microsoft is regularly credited with the innovation called the taskbar.  However, you must remember a couple of things.  Windows 95 was delayed giving OS/2 a nice little break.  So it released first.  It had a taskbar, but in OS/2 it was called the WarpCenter. Take the <a href="http://www.contact.net/os2/TOUR/">OS/2 Desktop Tour</a>.  The idea of the TaskBar isn't really innovative.  Most Mac users can tell you that.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Surely the General Electric XM-214! That beauty rocks!
<BR><BR>
<i>Because of your offense against LINUX I am going to hunt you down, wherever you may be, and shoot your head clean off.

<BR><BR>
I want to watch! I want to watch!
<BR><BR>
The gun is 30 lbs. The ammo (I suppose you will want about 1000 bullets) is 35 lb. The battery is additional 7 lb.
<BR><BR>
When fired at only 1000 rounds per minute, the recoil is 11 kg of continuous push. Increasing geometrically with fire rate (the XM is capable of rates up to 10,000 per minute).
<BR><BR>
In short, watching a man trying to handle such thing would be a spectacle well-worth of the risk.
<BR><BR>
Personally, I'd suggest a sniper rifle instead. It's cleaner, it's safer both for you, the target, and the civilians, and it's easier to acquire. I'd suggest ie. Heckler & Koch PSG-1 if you want accuracy, or Magnum 96 Destroyer if your target will cowardly hide behind up to an inch of steel (even at 1 km distance), or if you want something lighter and low-caliber, pick Accuracy International Super Magnum.
<BR><BR>
Machine guns on short distance are unnecessarily noisy and bloody and ammunition-wasting. On the other hand, you may prefer them for their amusement value.

He is a damn site far from informed. He has watched too many movies, or played to many games, starring minuguns and they have tainted his understanding of their purpose.<BR><BR>

In the Navy I fired a small GE minigun from the back of a patrol boat and I can assure you that they are not intended for shoulder carry nor are there any US military provisions for doing so. As for his sniper rifle examples, the Technika Destroyer is a joke, it does not really exist. Accuracy International makes a fine rifle but it failed to survive hostile environment testing and the M70 and Barrett 50 cal were adopted in its place.<BR><BR>

Anyone who is actually a SWAT sniper would be aware that there are much better sniper systems available at a much lower cost than any of the examples he provided. The Winchester Model 70 Stealth, the Remington 700 PSS, the police badged Savage 110, all would be far more accurate out of the box than any non-duty slotted sniper could shoot them, they all cost less than half of a PSG-1, and are available at your corner gun shop. <BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

Guess why XM214 never became M214 (X in this notation means eXperimental).
<BR><BR>
However, nothing can change that XM214 is one of my "pet" weapons. Despite of - or maybe because of - its drawbacks. I like it. I like it a lot. But I wouldn't pick it if I'd have to face a heat. (Actually, I'd prefer to stay somewhere safe and service the weapons of my comrades who would take the heat instead of me.)

Secondly you are using the Windows XP of Linux in Mandrake I think you will find that a distrobution of Linux that is as old as Windows 95 or even nearly as old as it will run at much the same capacity as Windows 95, so how can you campare an operating system that was written seven years ago?
<BR>
I might just as easily say that Windows XP does not run on a p133, but a version of linux written in 1995 does, there is no comparison.
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly just because 'you' can't install Linux does not make you or it different to the thousands of people who cannot install windows without spending hours on end on the phone to technical support people. I mean how hard did you try to install it ? Couldn't have been hard if you didn't even learn how to spell the name of the operating system right.
