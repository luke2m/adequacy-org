		Programming computers is, for practically everyone, something done far
away in exotic software engineering facilities by a priesthood of ultra-specialized,
half-mad obsessive-compulsives. This is as it should be, and it is where
we get the software we use every day to do our online banking, send email,
and get productive work done. Though few normal people have any experience
of it, or know anyone who does it, there is another kind of programming
performed outside this legitimate sphere, one that you probably assumed
was illegal, but shockingly, is not.
<p>This other kind of programming also affects us every day, but negatively,
as a continuous series of massive disruptions to the worldwide economy
in the form of viruses, in the form of important and useful computer services
being sabotaged with denial-of-service, in the form of defacement attacks,
and in the form of substantially higher prices for all sorts of intellectual
property such as software, DVD movies and music on CD, all due to piracy.
I'm talking about "hacking" of course. It is the evil dark side to all
the good that computers have brought us, and we are all sick of it. The
time has come to put a stop to "hacking", because we can no longer tolerate
the damage "hackers" cause, and the potential risk of terrorism when, not
if, "hackers" go to work for such forces of mayhem as have begun an onslaught
of terror against not just the United States, but Western Civilization's
freedom to be loose and decadent in general.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">For a time, our society tolerated "hackers" because they promised that
something useful would come of their shady and secretive tinkering. Yet
we have had nothing but a harvest of bitter fruit from "hackers", and it
is now time to pull the plug. It is time to ban all unlicensed computer
programming, and take steps to ensure that no one outside of government,
select universities, and state-sanctioned private-sector corporate software
engineering facilities is given the knowledge, skills, or means to write
or compile computer code of any kind. Amateur or hobbyist computer programming
has grown from a minor annoyance to a major social disease, and it simply
can no longer be tolerated.
<p>Although ordinary decent people will find this suggestion to be obvious
to the point of banality -- in fact, I'm sure many of you are surprised
that amateur computer programming was ever legal! -- many of those who
associate themselves with the "hacker community" will bridle at the suggestion.
Strictly as an exercise, it would perhaps be diverting to entertain some
of their more obvious objections.
<p>The first cry in defense of hobbyists toying with this dangerous technology
is that hackers have already proven their worth by producing a valuable
piece of software -- namely, the Apache web server. Others would even claim
that more than one useful program has been written in the garages and and
lonely bedrooms of hobbyists. There are two delusions at work here.
<p>One of these delusions is that any of the Open Source applications that
have found some utility in business and industry were written by amateurs.
The truth is that Apache began it's life as the work of professional coders
employed by Amazon.com, and as any software engineer you want to ask can
tell you, nothing of value was added by anyone but professionals. In truth,
the work of the gainfully employed programmers on this project was often
interrupted and even sabotaged by the ham-fisted meddling of the teenage
wanna-be's and self-styled "gurus" who have accumulated around professional
Open Source projects like so many leeches and barnacles. This episode alone
demonstrates that if there is anything good to come out of Open Source
methodology, it will only be helped along by the removal of dilettantes
from the picture. Indeed, once the "hackers" have been outlawed, Open Source
will very likely reach new heights of utility and quality, and perhaps
even fulfill the promise of greatness that Open Source advocates have been
making for years.
<p>The other delusion, or I should say piece of misinformation, that has
been perpetrated by "hackers" is that there are many other "tools" that
have been created by hackers and gifted to a grateful world by our benevolent
hobbyists. What about Emacs, for example? What about it? Emacs was originally
created at MIT, a trusted part of the US military research establishment.
Obviously, such facilities and their (suitably cleared) employees will
never be banned. The time has come to ban the reckless tourists from the
programming field, not legitimate university researchers. It is true that
Emacs, and similar tools have subsequently been "enhanced" by "hackers".
Generally, we have seen a pattern of mind-boggling feature creep and software
bloat as a result of this. Emacs, for all its admirers, is the worst known
example of this. In addition, all of the "functionality" that has been
added to Emacs, or other "tools" touted by free software hackers such as
Flex, Bison, gcc, etc. are hacker's tools. That means that they are like
lock picks or zip guns. They have no inherent functionality that is not
ultimately malevolent and illegal in its purpose. This is not utility or
service. This is disservice.
<p>The reason that hobbyists work so feverishly hard on creating this kind
of tool is precisely because they are locked out of the world of the normal,
decent software engineer, where professional-grade IDEs, debuggers, and
similar tools are abundant. Those with ultimately criminal intent must
cobble together their own weapons. There are dozens, even hundreds of these
types of destructive programs in circulation, such as those mentioned,
as well as the notorious "Back Orifice", or the hacker operating system,
"Lunix".  While a "hacker" could disingenuously and spuriously argue that
each one of these various illegal programs has some redeeming social value,
it is clear that taken as a whole, such "warez" do not in fact benefit
anyone except "hackers" and other criminals.
<p>Rather than waste any more time tediously demonstrating this fact for each
of these "hacker's" tools, it would be best to move on to the other canard
that "hackers" raise in defense of their "freedom" to "hack". And that
would be freedom itself. Is there a right to "hack"? Well, of course there
most certainly is <i>not</i>. Is there a right to build atomic bombs or breed
anthrax bacilli in one's back yard? Is there a right to spy on your government
and pass on that information to our foreign enemies, merely because you
have chosen espionage as a "hobby"? Perhaps you could claim that your interest
in espionage is driven by an innate curiosity, a desire to discover new
things and understand how the world works. And so what? Such apologetics
are amusing coming from children, but to hear an adult make such excuses
is not funny at all. It is merely sad.
<p>Few precocious adolescent "hackers" are capable of understanding why
responsible nations must ban "hacking", but as adults we can all recognize
that these apologetics for hobbyist "hacking" carry no weight at all, and so we must do
what is right. If you style yourself a "hacker" and you  really want to play around with dangerous toys, be
it source code, fissionable material, or biotoxins, then you have only
one route open to you: go to college and prove that you really have the
mental horsepower to cut the mustard, and prove also that you are a loyal
patriot who can be trusted with potentially deadly power. Then, and only
then, will a decent society trust you with the secrets of our most awesome
technology. Those too impatient to wait, too dull to get into a university,
and too flaky to get security clearance due to low character, drug abuse,
and trafficking with unsavory characters are simply out of luck. And it's
a good thing too.
<p>Is it practical to ban "hacking" now?
<p>Absolutely. There is no better time than now. As we have seen by the
recent mass murders by terrorists, computer technology is a mainstay of
criminals, and they rely most on such "free" tools as text editors and
military-grade encryption programs that "hackers" use simply because they
think it is cute to play with such power. But the rest of society has lost
patience with this childish diddling, and the civilized world has said
unequivocally that we want strong legal safeguards enacted to put an end
to "hacking" and terrorism. We most especially have no qualms about banning
activities like playing with explosives or creating software when these
so-called "hobbies" are restricted to a tiny fringe element who for whatever
reason gets no pleasure from healthy pastimes like fly fishing or drinking
alcohol at gentlemen's clubs. 
<p>Put simply, normal folks are not going to
let themselves get blown up because a tiny minority of freaks like to "hack".
If you aren't willing to code for Uncle Sam, then don't code at all.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Author's note:&nbsp; Since it is likely that many so-called g**ks or
"hackers" will read this article and will perhaps become angry about it,
and then, typically, lose control of their anger, I want to this opportunity to ask them to please
refrain from attacking Adequacy.org in retaliation.  Though you might
disagree with an opinion that you read, that is no reason to launch a denial
of service attack against the medium.  Please use your reason and,
if you feel strongly, engage in a polite dialogue, rather than acting out
your anger with illegal "hacking" attacks.  Thank you for not attacking
this web site.

The Internet is little more than an interactive television set, and with an Internet connection in practically every school and business, workers' and students' time is spent more and more on useless sites such as <a href="http://www.hotmale.com">hotmail</a> and <a href="http://www.hampsterdance2.com/">slashdot</a>. Obviously, this time used to be spent getting actual work done, and any productivity gained by using computer software is offset by the loss to Internet, Minesweeper and other distractions. I say we banish computers from our workplaces, and give them back to the garage-based "haxors" they originally came from.

Linux Torvalds was obviously qualified to go to a university, and did his famous work at a university.  No "hacker" could get into a university, and once there, no "hacker" would be allowed to use expensive equipment or to meddle with any important projects.  Torvalds was granted this responsibility because he could be trusted, hence he <i>cannont</i> be considered a "hacker".  He was not and is not any kind of amateur or hobbyist.   The entire point of this discussion is to limit programming to <i>only</i> trustworthy professionals like Linux Torvalds, and to put an end to the dangerous foolishness of dilettanes.

If you are interested in the developement process of the Linux kernel (which you admit to being ignorant of), please refer to <a href="http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/latest.html">Kernel Traffic</a>.  It's a summarization of mailing list discussions by the active developers of the Linux kernel.  Also, if you would like a look into the people behind some of the code, check out <a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/who/lmwho_1.html">an article</a> printed by Linux Magazine.  You'll notice that the short descriptions don't really touch on their backgrounds.  You see, Linux is an <b>open</b> developement environment.  In order to make a contribution, you don't submit your resume, you submit code.  If the code is useful, it's included, if not, it's not included.  It's that simple.<br>
<br>
I'll admit, most of the work on the kernel is done by "professionals" and people involved in higher education.  That would only make sense.  Creating an operating system is an ambitious project and in order to make useful contributions, you have to have great knowledge and experience with computing ideas and techniques.<br>
<br>
Calling for the ban of "unlicensed" programming is ridiculous.  Much of the interest in a system like Linux, or computer systems in general, is due to the fact that anybody can use a computer and get acquainted with computing concepts.  Just because most consumer desktop users don't take advantage of the oppurtunity is no reason to ban the practice altogether.<br>
<br>
When a computer user is able to write a virus which can hobble all users of a certain operating system, it's indicative of a poorly designed OS and/or poorly infomed users.  The effects of Nimda, Code Red, etc. are all easily avoidable, it's just that computer users don't take responsibility for their systems and the system creators made some poor design decisions.<br>
<br>
The licensing idea is not a bad one, but I believe you're taking the wrong approach.  I say, license computer users (which include those who choose to program).  Before somebody drops a grand or two on a complicated machine, they should be educated on it's uses and maintenance.  This way, you don't have home users with an unpatched Windows NT/2000 machine just waiting to get infected with the latest strain of Nimda or Code Red.  This way, you don't have inquisitive, but ignorant, email users opening up an attatchment named "readme.exe" (and the fact that that file can completely corrupt the OS is a bad OS design decision).  I don't know about you, but I'm a fan of legislation that expands our freedoms and makes excercising them easier.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>This is typical of how "hackers" steal.</blockquote>
What?  He didn't take credit for anything.  He said that you are ignorant.  He then said, "the developers of Linux...", while not claiming to be one himself.  How can that be construed as stealing?  Please refrain from making blanket statements, especially when they are unfounded.  The gross stereotypes running abound on this site sicken me.  You all might as well start calling me a "nigger" and telling me to go back to "hood".  Your treatment and ideas towards "g**ks" are fundamentally the same as other racist or discriminatory behavior.<br>

The U.S. government, alright it was really the FBI, went out and hired the help of the former Cult of the Dead Cow. For those of you who don't know the CDC was one of the top hacking organizations in the world. They are now dispersed through the highest levels of the FBI and CIA and working on keeping your PIN numbers, drivers licenses, bank accounts and ever girlfriends (I couldn't believe how stupid that comment was) safe.
<BR>
How about the stories we hear day after day about amateur programmers who broke into a secured system somewhere only to turn around and tell the administrator about the security hole and how to fix it?
<BR>
If we didn't have people like this Microsoft's world would quickly become the bible and all of our information could be easily compromised.
<BR>
Aside from that, if you ban amateur programming in the U.S., you still have to deal with offshore hackers who will be launching attacks from abroad (and believe me they will). Mafia Boy is from Montreal, Canada.
<BR>
Contrary to popular belief the U.S. does not govern the world. China, Russia, Europe, etc... all have programmers capable of creating mass damage at any one time. Making it illegal in the U.S. will not stop adequacy.org (an accurate name given the basis for this whole argument) from being brought down again and again.
<BR>
I do have a solution for you though. Perhaps if you all went to the scrap yards, fixed up some model "T" Fords and moved to wheat fields in the middle of Oklohoma then you could live like Mormon's and never worry about the world of evil technology which would be passing you by.

P.S. If not for the tinkering of mad scientists, evil warlocks and terribly derranged artists modern medicine would never have been invented and people would still be dying from things like the Chicken Pox.

This ideology that ALL Linux users are goofey looking hackers, with no money, no life is utterly rediculous.  I supposed Bill Gates looks like George Clooney in your mind (fag).

Is Linux a hacker OS?  Yes, but not in the way you think.  Hacking a kernel and hacking/cracking networks are to VERY different things.  Almost ANY programmer (whether a kid in his parent's basement, a High School Student, a University Student or a University Graduate) has the potential skills to be a hacker.  What kind of hacking is another story.

I don't take the concept of banning programming seriously (note my comment where I refer to the idea as "ridiculous").  I am familiar with programming methods and concepts.  If I gave the impression that I wasn't, I apologize because you've gotten the wrong impression.  I thought it was clear (from that post and my previous ones) that I am familiar with computing topics such as Linux, operating systems, programming, etc.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Hell your definition of HACKER is utter bullshit.</blockquote>
It is, however, the definition of hacker most accepted by the Linux community and more importantly by the dictionary I posted the link to (and by <a href="http://www.m-w.com">other dictionaries</a> too).  The main point I was trying to get across was that a hacker is not inherently malicious.  For the sake of clarity, it would be nice if in the comments posted here, people would use the term "cracker" to refer to a hacker with a malicious intent.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>This ideology that ALL Linux users are goofey looking hackers, with no money, no life is utterly rediculous.</blockquote>
I completely agree with this statement.  If I said anything which implied otherwise, it was completely unintentional.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>If you want to use your methodology to label hackers then EVERY programmer working at Microsoft is a HACKER.</blockquote>
I agree.  I do not believe I would be of line if I were to say, "Microsoft employees are paid to hack Windows code".  The term hack, according to it's <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=hack">dictionary definition</a>, is "to write or refine computer programs skillfully".  That happens to be exactly what Microsoft developers do with Windows code.<br>
<br>
I realize that there are also negative connotations to the word "hack", but I am not using it in that sense when I refer to either Linux or Windows developement.<br>

existence on the grounds that it <i>could</i> have a legal use under
some extremely unlikely set of circumstances. I'm sure that if Taco

they would have been bleating about how box cutters would have a
legitimate use "like, if one of the passengers got stuck in a box,

work in my DVD player while they're sitting on a shelf in town, but
that doesn't give me an excuse to go and steal them.

<BR><BR>Maybe g**ks just can't handle the thought of being criminals, or maybe
years of playing video games and wanking over video porn has convinced
them that whatever they believe is true, is true. Either way they're a bunch of self-serving amoral jerks, and the sooner we can legislate them out of existance the better.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Let me illustrate a situation I encountered not too long ago.<br>
<br>
I have a computer. I went to a local computer shop and <b>bought</b> a DVD-ROM drive.  In the aims of having the best performance, I also <b>bought</b> a Hollywood+ DVD decoder card.  I went to Best Buy and <b>bought</b> a DVD. I took my <b>legally purchased</b> equipment back home and proceeded to set everything up.<br>
<br>
At the time, I was using Debian (a distribution of Linux).  I downloaded it for free, which is fully legal and encouraged by it's producers.<br>
<br>
My problem is that the data on the DVD is encrypted and without some sort of software to decrypt it, <b>I cannot watch the movie</b>.<br>
<br>
Note that all I said I want to do is to <b>watch the movie</b>.  This, as far I know, is a legal use of the DVD I bought.  I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that that is the exact purpose the DVD was produced for.<br>
<br>
I did install a version of DeCSS along with DVD viewing software in order to use all the equipment and DVDs (that I <b>bought</b>) for their intended purposes.  However, I am technically breaking the law.<br>
<br>
In order to use the software that comes with the decoder card, I have to pay Microsoft to use their OS, so I can use the manufacturers software and drivers (which can be construed as a direct result of the fact that Microsoft has a near monopolistic hold on the desktop OS market).  The manufacturer does not produce Linux drivers.  This is logical, since the Linux market is very marginal.  It would not make business sense for the company to spend the time and resources to produce and maintain Linux versions of their software.<br>
<br>
However, thanks to the hardwork and technical knowledge of a group of Linux users, a Linux version of the drivers for the hardware are being produced.  Like a lot of Linux drivers and software, the support isn't as full featured or easy to use as the official Windows based counterpart.  By using it, I was able to use the equipment I legally bought.<br>
<br>
I was happy and so were the equipment manufacturers since I bought their hardware.  On top of that, they didn't even have to spend time and resources supporting me, since that was being done by a group of people completely unaffiliated with the company (when I switched the computer over to Windows 2000, they did hear from me though, because their Win2K support was marginal at the time).<br>
<br>
I really don't understand how this situation can be construed as negative.  I'm happy becuase I'm making use of the equipment I legally purchased.  The equipment manufacturers are happy becasue they made money off of the said purchases.  The Linux driver developers are happy because they have another user providing feedback for the work their doing.  The DVD producers are happy, because I'm happily consuming one of their products.  But wait....<br>
<br>
The DVD producers aren't happy.  <b>I am using software (not produced by them) that makes use of the hardware (not produced by them)<i> that I bought</i></b> in a way not sanctioned by them.  They aren't able to milk this situation for all it's worth.  By trying to get a strangle hold on the DVD player market and lobbying for increased legislated control over how products <b>not produced by them</b> can be used, they end up infringing on the rights of people like me, who just want to make use the stuff they bought.<br>
<br>
I would attempt to take the time to refute the argument made by the main poster.  But arguing the opposite perspective around here is an incredibly laborous process (just look at the length of this post).  I have to constantly explain anything remotely technical (notice the excessive use of parentheses) becuase otherwise I will be construed as "g**k" trying to "confuse" all the "normal people" with my technical mumbo jumbo.  Hopefully, the above post will be read and understood.  Hopefully, it won't be modded down like most all my other posts for expressing an alternate viewpoint (thanks Craig McPherson!).  Hopefully, I'll recieve a similarly logical reply.<br>

My dad named me the "II" becuase he thought "Jr." sounded funny.  If you have any problems, take them up with him.<br>
<br>
Please excuse any spelling mistakes.  I don't really believe that detriments the point I'm trying to make.<br>
<br>
Also, don't mistake this for a Windows vs Linux argument.  As I said above, I switched <b>from</b> Linux <b>to</b> Windows.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<i>Your problems with Lunix are your own to resolve legally without special recognition for your failure to integrate with the rest of humanity in favor of pursuing hacker ethics. </i>
<br><br>
First of all it's called Linux, at first I thought you'd just made a typo but no it would seem that you just can't spell.<br><br>
Secondly what ever happened to having a choice? A choice to be ripped off by Microsoft or to use a decent OS, like Linux (not Lunix). <br><br>
Third, how the hell is by-passing CSS to watch a legally bought DVD on a legal OS, on legal hardware illegal? No one stole the code to CSS, some 16 year old kid managed to by pass it with ease with a very simple piece of code. If i had written CSS I would be ashamed of myself for having written such a useless piece of software. I don't have to pay for a licence to watch a VHS tape, why the hell should I pay you a licence to watch a legally bought DVD, the DVD I bought didn't come with any Terms and Conditions telling me what system I can watch it on and which I can't.<br><br>
Well having read a few more articles on this site I have decided it's must be a joke. If not then it's blind idiots like most of those here who let huge corporations like Microsoft obtain such powers over governments and laws.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The MPAA is just pissed off that some naughty people are getting away with watching DVDs without using a piece of software that the developers had to pay a stupid amount of money for a CSS licence. If watching movies that you've paid good money for is illegal I hate to think what's next. Well in fact if the SSSCA bill gets through I know what will be next, open source software.
<br><br>
Anyway, there is nothing wrong with the way I watch DVDs as I live in the UK which doesn't recognise the stupid DMCA and therefore for me there is nothing wrong with using DeCSS. It's just the unfortunate people in the US, where the government puts corporate rights before the right's of it's own people, who are accused of stealing when they watch movies.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Ludicrous licenses have simply been met with equally ludicrous opposing licenses. Corporate terms restrict usage to a very narrow acceptable band, whereas open terms do the opposite.


<BR><BR>
It's cause and effect, the search for balance. If someone intentionally attacks my home, I fight to be able to protect my home. To reasonable people, many of the legislature being passed by corporations seems greedy and overbearing. Equate this with an abusive parent who is angry at a child because the child is growing up and isn't willing to be held down with the yoke of supporting the parent that has abused him.


<BR><BR>
Look around you. Who would want to be a martyr? Why should corporations be any different? They are entities not unlike any individual human. Of course they'll want things a certain way, and will keep their icy grasp on the law of the land until they simply slip into oblivion. It is this clout that must be relinquished in order for progress to happen. Any corporation which allows itself to fade will give rise to others.


<BR><BR>
The stifling of democracy in this country has simply given rise to a plethora of miniature dictatorships, many of which are the size of small nations. Why should companies be treated any differently than governments? They are already above the law, however, so it would seem that hope is mostly lost. Especially since many on this board and the United States in general advocate the compliance of degrading mandates. Lobbied legislature to enforce overly obsequious licensing schemes will not fix the problem. It will only become worse, and by then, we will all be paying the price whether we were for or against it. History repeats itself.

I'll be moving to an undisclosed location far from the reaches of mega-conglomerate corporations now, thanks for the oppression and spiritual decay.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Please tell me you're kidding.  Using legally purchased hardware and media and using it on an unsupported Operating System is logically the same (according to your argument) as driving a car through a schoolyard?  Your analogy is false at the very least, and a complete miscarriage of language if you intended it as anything other than a joke.  

First off, there is nothing in DVD licensing that dictates that certain hardware/software combos are "illegal" for use in watching DVDs.  The only concern of licensing is the Region encoding which is handled in the DVD-ROM drive itself.  A more appropriate analogy for the linux user wanting to watch DVDs on his computer is a person using a blender in his living room instead of his kitchen.  Is there any logical reason to say that a person should <i>only</i> use his or her blender in his or her kitchen?  Is the blender going to behave erratically or in a manner unintended by the manufacturer if it is operated from the comfort of one's favorite chair or sofa?  

Implying that all Linux users are inherently "hackers" reveals a Luddite mentality.  Would you rather simply smash all computers using the Linux operating system so we can live in a Windows-only world?  The fact is both Linux and Windows are, somewhere in their history, derived from general UNIX.  Linux is not a tool of crackers (which is what you should say when you say "hackers"); Linux is an excellent open-source alternative to MacOS and Windows that is in most respects more stable and more secure than either of the aforementioned OSes.  

The failure of the Motion Picture industry to support Linux or UNIX with their CSS licensing reveals their staunch refusal to adapt along with the constantly evolving technology they employ.  Something tells me the MPAA was less than thrilled with the notion of watching DVDs on computers <i>as a whole</i>, much less watching them on an OS they are too lazy to offer support for.  

Calling someone "ignorant" for bringing forth a valid criticism of the CSS standard only serves to reveal your own ignorance about technology and intellectual property laws.  The fact is, if enough consumers raise hell about the lack of Linux support under CSS, the MPAA will support it.  Marginalizing Linux and the people who work diligently to make it better will not make it go away.  Would we be up in arms if Windows "stole" pieces of Linux and incorporated it?  Nah.  Like I said, Windows and Linux ultimately share the same lineage, and besides, whether or not Microsoft steals open-source code has no bearing on this argument.  The DVD copyright owners don't want us "to play them on Windows machines," because the operating system is an irrelavant issue.  They're just pissed that someone found a way around they're protection scheme.  Instead of blaming the people that took that knowledge and started ripping copies of movies, they blamed the people that figured it out in the first place, despite that copyright law at the time dictated that, as licensees of the data contained on the DVD, they were within their rights to watch that data.  Circumventing encryption was the only way they could view the data they had a purchased a license to view.  If I buy the hardware necessary to watch a DVD, I fully expect to be able to watch it, regardless of whatever Operating System is running the hardware.  This OS restriction is purely arbitrary.  The MPAA might as well have said that they don't support silver DVD players and brought suit against anyone who watched a movie in a silver player instead of a black one.

<BR>

<BR>
1. perl does support objects (at least since perl5)
<BR>
2. perl is not a linux only language. it has its roots in unix and is available for all flavours of it (aix, bsd, solaris, linux, sco unix, etc.) and is even available for windows (try google: activeperl)
<BR>
3. perl has various xml-parser implementations to choose. if they are properly implemented is not to be judged by you, but by the w3c.
<BR>
4. perl compilers might optimise code.. depending on their implementation. same is true for any compiled or precompiled language. you cant tell that this is a language feature, it is a vendor-feature instead.
<BR>
5. perl is powerful, but like every language it is limited in applicability. same is true for elisp. there is no such thing like an universal applicable language.
<BR>
6. i dont understand your last point. i have no grade in computer science. i might be an amateur, so please explain your point.
<BR>

as i said, i dont have a grade in computer science. i _only_ have a grade in electrical engineering, but work as software engineer...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Also, you can refer to <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=perl">dictionary.com</a> if you need further clarification.  Yes, Practical Extraction and Report Language is one of the meaning of the Perl (some say it also means Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister (it's a joke)).  But notice the 'a' in 'and' is not part of the acronym.  It's comparable to the United States <i>of</i> America.  Yes, the word 'of' is part of the name, but the 'o' is not included in the acronym (USA).<br>
<br>
To those of you arguing Perl is a worthless language, all I can do is laugh.  Go ahead and check out the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scoop">SourceForge page for Scoop</a>.  If you didn't already notice, the script that runs this site is written in Perl.<br>

Might I remind you that all posts with a rating of "1" or above are visible to all users, so post ratings are pretty meaningless.  If I wanted to censor your oh-so-wise words, I'd use 0's instead of 1's.  I don't think I've given you any zeros.  I use a fairly consistent system: trolls get 0, Linix geeks and posts with no sound logic get 1, 2's go to wankers who happen to make one or two good points (or to bring zero-rated posts back up to 1 if I don't think they should've been zero-rated), and 5's go to insightful, logical people with their fingers of the pulse of America, society, and the world.<BR><br><br>--

Actually, it doesn't "completely" discredit it.  When I made the comment, every comment of mine you had rated was given a 1.  On top of that, I never stated that I thought you gave my posts a 1 rating without consideration.  I was just asking you why you were doing it.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Linix geeks and posts with no sound logic get 1</blockquote>
Ok, here's an answer to my question.  Let me ask you another.  What in my above post showed unsound logic?  TheReverand made an untrue claim and I corrected him and provided proof for my correction.  Unless I'm missing something, there's nothing unsound with that.  In the case that I am missing something here, please inform me of the error of my logic and justify  the 1 rating you gave my post.<br>
<br>
But wait, there's another possibility here.  It sems that I am just a "linux geek".  Even though my post had nothing to do with Linux, you discriminate anyway.  Long live the open and intelligent discourse of adequacy.org.<br>
<br>
While we're at it...<br>
<br>
<blockquote>2's go to wankers who happen to make one or two good points</blockquote>
So, in my one post you rated a 2, I moved up to "wanker" status because I made a good point or two (remember, you only "rate posts based solely on the factual integrity and literary quality of each one").  But then you proceed to try to argue against what you saw as my "good points".  My original point still stands, your actions really don't make sense to me.<br>

You might note that I mention in the original article that "text editors" are a hacker's tool.  I mean it.  Normal people create documents with Word.  Text editors and such things are not needed, except to do things you weren't intented to do.
<BR><BR>
I'm planning a couple follow-up articles on implementation.  On the hardware end, for example, all computers sold in the future will have to be much like iMacs, except with a welded-shut steel case, and probably a big capacitor that discharges into the motherboard if any any tampering is detected.  Then you could hard-wire all machines so that they would only run execuables that are certified as coming from an institution or company with clearance.
<BR><BR>
In software, perhaps the entire protocol of the net should be changed, to make everything in the future incompatible with older hardware and the tools that run on it.  That way you wouldn't have to make such an effort to confiscate every compiler or every copy of telnet.  Older machines would just become obsolete and fall into disuse and decay.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If you examine the general trend in the numbers, you would notice that they increase sharply as time goes on, or decrease sharply as you go backwards. The totals of 1999 and 2000 are less than 10M greater than the estimate for the first half of 2001. So, if we work backwards, the estimates should continue to fall accordingly. This assumption being based on the coorelation between the growth of the internet and and the increase of "hacker" (as you call it) activity.  First, lets examine the "worst case cenario".  Assume that damages remained constant from 1999 back to 1970. Even then damages would only have exceeded 2 billion dollars if you went back 15 years, to 1986. The assumtion that losses remain contstant however is laughable, so lets assume that hacking losses increased by 50% each year from the founding of the internet. that would give us the following approximate values:
<BR>
    1998: 80M
<BR>
    1997: 55M
<BR>
    1996: 40M
<BR>
    1995: 25M
<BR>
    1994: 15M
<BR>
    1993: 10M
<BR>
    1992: 7M
<BR>
    1991: 5M
<BR>

<BR>
With these figures, the magical billion mark is not reached until you go back to 1991, and the value would never get much higher than 1.1billion
<BR>
if you went back to the dawn of time.
<BR>

<BR>
So, yes, the number may be over 1 billion dollars( but I think present estimates are grossly inflated as it is), but the claim I am contesting is that damages are "Billions (two or more) of dollars" which is demonstratively false, and is either an unintention un-truth or a deliberate falsehood used to prop up an argument.
<BR>

<BR>
Please do not try to argue that my projections are off.  Even if losses remained constant from 1999 back, you wouldn't break 2 billion until ~1986.  And there is no possibly way that 120 million dollars were being stolen when the only people with internet access were the gov't and large (very large) universities.

It does not include those who chose not to share this informaion with the F.B.I.  We all know how reluctant companies are to admit how much they have lost to hacking, or even that they have been hacked at all.  Nor do your numbers include any even minimal estimates from those companies who could not provide an exact dollar value.  We know this number is greater than zero.
<BR><BR>
But most of all, this study you are discussing <i>only examines direct security breaches</i>.  That is limited to when a hacker targets that company and breaks in and causes damage.  It is an extremely limited study.   It completely ignores losses to piracy, for example.  It does not count at all the increased daily costs due to having to guard against hacks and viruses.
<BR><BR>
And the biggest thing of all is left out compeletely from that one study:  VIRUSES and WORMS!  Code Red alone caused billions in losses.  And then there is Code Red II.  And I Love You.  And Mellissa.  And more.  And what about Unix viruses?
<BR><BR>
No one has a precise estimate of the damage, but we know that it does add up to more than a billion for all the viruses together.  And you yourself have proven that the minimum low-ball estimate for direct break-ins is one billion dollars.  So add that to the cost of viruses, and the cost of IP theft, and the cost of security against the horde of hackers on the loose, and you easily come up with more than two billion dollars.  I would confidently say it is TEN billion.
<BR><BR>
And in any event, it is much more than the cost of banning hobbyist hacking.  Be honest for once.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Software publishers grossly overestimate losses due to piracy. Most of the time, if somebody pirates a program, she would not have bought it anyway; that instance of piracy thus reduces a publisher's sales by $0.00 and may in fact produce a slight profit, as the publisher does not have to spend money manufacturing the CD and printing the manual and box.
<BR><BR>
Another piracy overestimate occurs when Adobe reports pirated copies of Photoshop products as the loss of a Photoshop Full Version sale ($600) instead of the loss of a Photoshop Elements sale ($100). Adobe markets PS Elements to home users who for the most part do not need the full version's prepress capabilities. (Most of the $500 difference goes to Pantone for color-matching royalties.) Most business users that need prepress have the resources and the professionalism to license the full version of Photoshop.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">but anyway, most of the 'anti-hacking' arguement here is nothing more than simplistic linguistic sophistry.  you define a 'hacker' as someone who is of necessity an uneducated, malicious, lazy fool, in opposition to the way that most of the online community uses the term (note for instance the need for the qualifier in the term 'malicious hacker), and then argue that hacking is 'bad'.  well, by your definition, of course that is true, but the reasoning is tautologous and meaningless as presented.
<BR>

<BR>
where do you suppose that the big corporations and the governments and universities got the people they have working for them?  if there were no 'hobbyists', there would be far fewer people eventually becoming skilled, trained, productive employees/students; 'tinkering' and personal exploration is how they discover that they enjoy coding enough to make a career out of it, in many cases.  it is of course natural that someone who enjoys coding or whatnot will attempt to make his living in a related field.
<BR>

<BR>
your circular reasoning shows up again when you say that the worthy products are all owned by companies etc.  naturally, if a 'hacker' comes up with a good idea, in many cases he would like to see some money for it, and so sells it to a large company.  in other cases, the 'hackers' may form their own company, which i suppose 'legitimizes' them in your eyes, especially when they become a huge corporation (hewlett-packard, for instance).  by your logic, someone is a hacker unless they eventually use their skills in some way that is considered useful to mainstream society, at which point they are no longer (and by some rhetorical slight-of-hand, apparantly never were) a hacker at all.  so you say that anybody who does anything useful is not a hacker, and then say hackers do nothing useful.

this is the sort of thinking by which one might say, to defend use of the word "nigger", "well, if a black person is intelligent, or not a crack smoker, then by definition he isn't a nigger, so there's no reason for non crack-smoking, non-theiving, educated black people to take any offense by my saying that all niggers are stupid, thieving crack-whores."

Sometimes, though, fiction is written to make a point: to describe how the world is through fictional allegory, or to describe how the world could be if certain factors existed.
<br><br>
Science Fiction, a mainstay of the world's intellectual elite, is usually written to make a point of how the world could be in the future if certain factors in the course of cultural or technological development goes certain ways.  One of the most famous future-forecasting science fiction works, which has proven to be oddly prophetic, is George Orwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451524934/ref=bxgy_sr_text_a/107-6296960-1046109"><i>1984</i></a>.  It was written to warn against the evils of large, oppressive governments and described a distopian world in which the oppressive government ruled with an iron fist the citizenry through societal mind control, control over the media, and brainwashing.
<br><br>
<i>1984</i>, though fictional, proved to be eerily prophetic.  In the nearly two decades since <i>1984</i> was written, much of it has come true exactly as Orwell predicted.  Not a day goes by without friend of Liberty decrying some new government program as "Orwellian," and "Big Brother" has become a household term every time the government tries to erode more and more of our Liberties.
<br><br>
This theft of Freedom has hit record levels in the wake of the terrorist attacks, and shows no signs of sloping off.  <i>1984</i> has come to 2001.
<br><br>
Another philosopher whose works have been proven eerily prophetic in the wake of recent events is <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard M Stallman</a> of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free Software Foundation.</a>.  In his prophetic and allegorical story <b>The Right To Read</b>, he describes a world in which big corporations and people like the author of this article have taken away our rights.  The corporations have done exactly what the author of this article suggested: <b>programming has been made illegal</b>, free libraries have been shut down, and book are now pay-per-view.

Read this with an open mind as see <b>exactly</b> what the world would be like if Elenchos had his way.

<i>The Right to Read</i>
Richard Stallman, 1996
<BR><BR>
(Verbatim copying and distribution of this entire article is
permitted in any medium, provided this notice is preserved.)
<BR><BR>
For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college--when Lissa Lenz
asked to borrow his computer.  Hers had broken down, and unless she
could borrow another, she would fail her midterm project.  There was
no one she dared ask, except Dan.

<BR><BR>
This put Dan in a dilemma.  He had to help her--but if he lent her his
computer, she might read his books.  Aside from the fact that you
could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your
books, the very idea shocked him at first.  Like everyone, he had been
taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and
wrong--something that only pirates would do.

<BR><BR>
And there wasn't much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection
Authority--would fail to catch him.  In his software class, Dan had
learned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and
where it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing.  (They used this
information to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal
interest profiles to retailers.)  The next time his computer was
networked, Central Licensing would find out.  He, as computer owner,
would receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent
the crime.

<BR><BR>
Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books.  She
might want the computer only to write her midterm.  But Dan knew she
came from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition,
let alone her reading fees.  Reading his books might be the only way
she could graduate.  He understood this situation; he himself had had
to borrow to pay for all the research papers he read.  (10% of those
fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for
an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if
frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)

<BR><BR>
Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the
library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to
pay.  There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages
without government library grants.  But in the 1990s, both commercial
and nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access.
By 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature
were a dim memory.

<BR><BR>
There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central
Licensing.  They were themselves illegal.  Dan had had a classmate in
software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,
and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading
books.  But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them
turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were
easily tempted into betrayal).  In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for
pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.

<BR><BR>
Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have
debugging tools.  There were even free debugging tools available on CD
or downloadable over the net.  But ordinary users started using them
to bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this
had become their principal use in actual practice.  This meant they
were illegal; the debuggers' developers were sent to prison.

<BR><BR>
Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger
vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to
officially licensed and bonded programmers.  The debugger Dan used in
software class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be
used only for class exercises.

<BR><BR>
It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a
modified system kernel.  Dan would eventually find out about the free
kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around
the turn of the century.  But not only were they illegal, like
debuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing
your computer's root password.  And neither the FBI nor Microsoft
Support would tell you that.

<BR><BR>
Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer.  But he
couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her.  Every chance to
speak with her filled him with delight.  And that she chose him to ask
for help, that could mean she loved him too.

<BR><BR>
Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he
lent her the computer, and told her his password.  This way, if Lissa
read his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them.  It
was still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about
it.  They would only find out if Lissa reported him.

<BR><BR>
Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his
own password, it would be curtains for both of them as students,
regardless of what she had used it for.  School policy was that any
interference with their means of monitoring students' computer use was
grounds for disciplinary action.  It didn't matter whether you did
anything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the
administrators to check on you.  They assumed this meant you were
doing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it
was.

<BR><BR>
Students were not usually expelled for this--not directly.  Instead
they were banned from the school computer systems, and would
inevitably fail all their classes.

<BR><BR>
Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started
only in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began
using computers.  Previously, universities maintained a different
approach to student discipline; they punished activities that were
harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.

<BR><BR>
Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA.  His decision to help her led to
their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been
taught about piracy as children.  The couple began reading about the
history of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on
copying, and even the original United States Constitution.  They moved
to Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from
the long arm of the SPA.  When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the
universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.

<BR><BR>
The right to read is a battle being fought today.  Although it may
take 50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most
of the specific laws and practices described above have already been
proposed--either by the Clinton Administration or by publishers.

<BR><BR>
There is one exception: the idea that the FBI and Microsoft will keep
the root passwords for personal computers.  This is an extrapolation
from the Clipper chip and similar Clinton Administration key-escrow
proposals, together with a long-term trend: computer systems are
increasingly set up to give absentee operators control over the people
actually using the computer system.

<BR><BR>
The SPA, which actually stands for Software Publisher's Association,
is not today an official police force.  Unofficially, it acts like
one.  It invites people to inform on their coworkers and friends; like
the Clinton Administration, it advocates a policy of collective
responsibility whereby computer owners must actively enforce copyright
or be punished.

<BR><BR> The SPA is currently threatening small Internet service providers,
demanding they permit the SPA to monitor all users.  Most ISPs
surrender when threatened, because they cannot afford to fight back in
court.  (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 1 Oct 96, D3.)  At least one
ISP, Community ConneXion in Oakland CA, refused the demand and was
actually &lt;!-- &lt;a href="https://www.c2.net/ispdc/"&gt; -->sued.  The
SPA is said to have dropped this suit recently, but they are sure to
continue the campaign in various other ways.

<BR><BR>
The university security policies described above are not imaginary.
For example, a computer at one Chicago-area university prints this
message when you log in (quotation marks are in the original):

<blockquote>
"This system is for the use of authorized users only.  Individuals using
this computer system without authority or in the excess of their authority
are subject to having all their activities on this system monitored and
recorded by system personnel.  In the course of monitoring individuals
improperly using this system or in the course of system maintenance, the
activities of authorized user may also be monitored.  Anyone using this
system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such
monitoring reveals possible evidence of illegal activity or violation of
University regulations system personnel may provide the evidence of such
monitoring to University authorities and/or law enforcement officials."
</blockquote>

<BR><BR>
This is an interesting approach to the Fourth Amendment: pressure most
everyone to agree, in advance, to waive their rights under it.
</blockquote>

I get goose pimples every time I read this story, because I see this "fictional" story becoming more and more real every day.

First they say you can't have your own missile launcher, and next thing you know they have cameras spying on every bedroom.
<BR><BR>
It is a very, very weak defense of "hacking".  The reason for grasping at straws like this -- sci-fi scenarios and slippery slope fallacies -- is that there is so little too shore up the the only possible foundation for justifying hacking.  There is nothing of general benefit and utility coming from "hackers", so you can't say we will lose anything important without them.  Nor is there any essential liberty so intertwined with "hacking" that we will be less free without it.  We will be the same, only safer.  
<BR><BR>
"Hacking" is a threat to public safety, and to justify "hacking" you have to give a good reason to put up with that threat.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

Shakespeare is such a cultural hero that everyone has "read" him a little.  If you want to claim more credibly to be intelligent (rather than just able,) your credential-generating reading list might include but not be limited to the works of the following authors:<BR><BR>

Fichte, Husserl, Hegel, Spinoza, Descartes, Leibniz, Voltaire, Rousseau, Abelard, Villon, Conrad, Gogol, Terrence, Hume, Cicero, Thucydides, Plato, Cao Xueqin, Li Bao, Lady Murasaki, the foul Tanazaki, Locke, and (I'd say) the Church Fathers and some ecclesiastical history, for a start.<BR><BR>

Frankly, a great-books shout-out from high school does not impress me very much.  It's tediously typical g**k thinking - "people who don't study natural sciences don't really study anything of substance, so I can dabble in their fields and be much better at it."  These are the same people who think computer science is a natural science.<BR><BR>

I can mention Umberto Eco, Hawking, Darwin, Ceaser, Vergil, Petronius, Cicero (I've translated all four of those from the original Latin, i.e the Gallic Wars, the Aeneid, Cicero's Orations, among others), Sun Tzu (kinda trite), Confucius, The Bhagavad Gita, Sartre, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, etc...<br>
And I have yet to meet a stupid person who can read quickly, that's an oxymoron.  However, I've met some smart ones who are quick to put their foot in their mouth.<br>
And actually, my B.S. is in Computer Science, and I'm still waiting for my white jacket and clipboard.
<br>
<br>
btw: I think this thread originally started with me bemoaning the elitist attitude of psuedo-intellectuals.  However I can't win.  I either get Frasier Crane breathing down my back for enjoying plebian authors as Robbins, or Stephensen, instead of just reading Suetonius.  But then Joe Bob says that I'm being too "sophisticated" for reading books that aren't brain candy.  My final point to this thread is, I like to read, everything and anything (and I retain it).  Whereas I think I am improving myself by reading as much as possible, I'm not going to have an elitist attitude towards people who only read Mary Higgins Clark, or to the people who think you have to read the classics to be a productive member of the intelligencia.  In the end an asshole is an asshole, and a friend is a friend.

I'm still baffled that you claim to enjoy Stephenson.  I've only read <i>Snow Crash,</i> but it struck me as being the sort of pseudo-intellectual bong-hit science crap that <a href="http://slashdot.org">Kurobots</a> and <a href="http://kuro5hin.org">wankers</a> revel in.  The protagonist has a cheap joke name, a contrived and preposterous moral superiority through an improbable mixed ancestry, inimitable (and inexplicable) proficiency in weapons, and just happens to be the world's 1337est h4x0r.  The only justification I can even imagine for that book is that Stephenson wanted to introduce the comic-book crowd to new theories of the brain or something.<BR><BR>

I'm a classical musician.  Most of the greats in my field, like my heroes <a href="http://www.rodoni.ch/busoni/amicicoevi/nikitsch.html">Nikisch</a> or <a href="http://www.jaschaheifetzsociety.org"> Heifetz,</a> were not primarily men of letters.  There are lots of other things you can do that are important.  What offends me is when <a href="http://slashdot.org/"> geeks</a> decide that the ability to hack Perl proves they're intellectuals.<BR><BR>

Maybe being part of the world's intellectual elite is of no importance to you, and you don't have any respect for us who are.   Maybe you even scoff at our status as guardians of high culture and artistic sophisitication, and think we are in fact pompous, self-important blowhards who only <i>pretend</i> to understand and appreciate Plath and Joyce because we are nothing but snobs. Fine.  Whatever.  We expect the untutored mob to think that about us.  We would not have it any other way, if truth be told.
<BR><BR>
  But the original post attempted to use the argument to authority fallacy to try to claim that, one, a snippet of speculative sci-fi could be used to tell us what we should and should not ban here and now, and two, that we should believe this fictional speculation because such trash is read by the "world's intellectual elite".  I was showing how this is all wrong in several different ways.

By the way, on Orwell:  <i>1984</i> is studied in the eighth grade in nearly every junior high school in the US.  While Orwell is a fine author, this example of required reading in the public schools hardly has a thing to do with either being an intellectual or being elite.  Requried reading is about as common as you can get.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

Evidence: Prohibition, the Drug Trade.  Have you seen RC6 yet?  yup.  since you can't export strong encryption over 128 bits, someone overseas wrote strong encryption that uses 384 -- and it's NOT LEGAL FOR USE IN THE US! (dll runtime available for download at www.bo2k.com)
<BR>

This idea that all people are equal, regardless of intelligence and personal achievement is a most unsuppotable claim, expecially coming from someone who preaches the doctrine of individuality with the same breath. What is the point in improving yourself as an individual if we are all equal, no matter what we do?

It seems to me that this blind faith in egalitarian ideals is an overapplication of the concept of equality before the law. No person has more basic rights than any other. Beyond that, equality is an illusion.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The person I was referencing had clearly stated many times he was elitist, if you had read the parent threads.  I didn't call the person an asshole, or say he sucks.  I merely repeated what he had already said about himself, that people who read a lot and try to broaden their intellectual horizons are automatically better, i.e. elitism.  I didn't say that his arguments are wrong because he is elitist, I said that elitism is wrong.
<br>
As for the second URL, I guess I did use Argument Ad Backstreet Boys.
<br><br>
And if you are going to use a a fallacious argument to make a point, you should declare it in your post, and not in a later point.  That way it doesn't seem like you are trying to cover your ass.
<br>
And as for politics, which was brought up as a total non sequitur to the whole argument, no, I wouldn't vote just on personality.  If the argument had involved politics, I would have mentioned that I choose a candidate based on his record, his views, and his policies, and how they affect me, and not on just his personality, although that is a small factor in my choice, be it a very small factor, though.  However, when dealing with people on a one on one basis, I give everyone the opportunity to prove to me they are or aren't worthy of my attention, innocent til proven guilty, so to speak.  I have plenty of great friends who are dumb as a rock, but are still better people than some intellectuals I know.  And the reverse is true.  Whereas, I think the drive to constantly learn and improve yourself is great, it's not a prerequisite to be a good human being.

I have never had any formal education in programming.  I am, by my own definition, a hacker.  I have a God-given desire to learn and to understand the world around me, not to mearly accept it.  I am not a malicious hacker, in fact there are very few in relation to those who merely want to learn. By and large the hacker community actually shuns these people as second rate, or script-kiddies. There are bad hackers, just like there are bad Arabs and bad Americans. I am not condoning malicious programming, it should be stopped, and there are harsh laws prohibiting it.  But to outlaw hacking would be to outlaw an entire lifestyle and method of education, this is not an acceptable response.  This brings to mind a familiar example, "Outlaw the gun, and only the outlaws will have them.", the same is true of hacking. Outlaw it and you outlaw the future programmers that have made an industry great. The only ones remaining will be the ones you sought to destroy.  If what you suggest would have been in effect 30 years ago, the software industry would be a very different place. There would be no Apple Computer, which was started by a hardware hacker. No Lotus 1-2-3, the first commercial spreadsheet, written by a hermit hacker. And no Microsoft. (Bill Gates was a hacker)  Something you may find interesting is that the businesses that have shaped the computer into the tool it is today, were largly started by self-proclaimed hackers. Just some food for thought... (fyi, scoop - the engine that powers this forum, was also written by a hacker)

As the computer industry matures, more and more regulations will be needed.

I would recommend that all parents take steps to prevent their children from learning about computers, beyond the most basic level needed to use the devices. Ideally, children should be restricted to safe platforms, such as playstation 2, where hacking is impossible. Also, internet filters should blacklist pages describing computer technology.

The command prompt is necessary.  There are just some things that cannot be done with a point-and-click interface.  Try running IPCONFIG (to check to a determine why your system may not be able to connect to the network, or PING to test connectivity to specific hosts on your network) without the command prompt.

Yes, let us remove the TOOLS that Network Administrators, PC Techs, Network Analysts use EVERY friggin day.  Just because you do not use something (because you are ignorant and wouldn't know how anyway) doesn't mean that everyone should have to suffer for your ignorance.
<BR>

<BR>
Go and tell your idea to a network administrator that he can no longer telnet in and diagnose a problem with the network off campus.  That he must drive, and be sitting at the server EVERYTIME there is a problem.  Even at 3am.  Maybe you should tell Microsoft to no longer allow corporations to set up a RAS (Remote Acces Server) using the Microsoft Server OSes.
<BR>

<BR>
And how the HELL is View &gt;&gt; Source a hacking tool?  There's no HACKING involved.  Viewing the source code for a web site is PERFECTLY LEGAL.  If you don't want someone looking at the source code (for say the web pages used on the companies INTRANET) then don't publish them on public domains.  That;s what a DOMAIN CONTROLLER does.  It sets up DOMAINS.  Some people have access others DON'T.  Even within the company.
<BR>

<BR>
I have a web server.  And much of it is LINKED or Publish on the public domain.  The rest such as the SQL database is NOT.  And it is protected from someone simply typing a URL.

<BR><BR>
This is why you are so inclined to send me to Micro-Soft with my ideas, because you hope that they will reject them, and hence de-legitimize them.  But Micro-Soft is neither your good daddy nor your bad daddy.  Micro-Soft is just some big company, nothing more.
<BR><BR>
So while you "hackers" with you infantile complexes play out your rebellion-submission cycle with this father totem of Micro-Soft, the rest of us normal, healthy adults simply look at them as a company that sometimes does things right, and sometimes not.  And ultimately, even Micro-Soft has to obey the law.  They are not the all-powerful father-archetype of your fetid sub-conscious.

As far as the technical necessity of these tools for end-users, simply glance at any Mac-Intosh computer.  The Mac-Intosh has always gotten along fine without all that low-level stuff.  If something goes wrong, it can be repaired by an authorized professional with appropriate tools, but there is no need at all for them to be available to the end-user.

Let's first look at the Mac.  The Mac is a completely different OS and communicates very differently with hardware than an OS on a PC.  Hell, the PC has STILL yet to move away from the floppy drive and Plug and Pray is still not on par with that of the Mac.  And what's amazing about that is the Mac has been a P&P OS long before Windows.

I guess all those tech support guys should just pack up their bags then.  End users don't need their help.  Remember that next time you have to call tech support.  You're probably one of those guys that ANYTIME ANYTHING goes wrong with Windows you reinstall it.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't look at Microsoft (not Micro-Soft) as any form of parent figure.  I do not program.  I do not write code.  Therefore, how do I fit into YOUR classification of a hacker?  I am a Network Administrator.  I use those tools everyday for legal legitimate purposes.  I have used those tool for YEARS even before I was an Admin.
<BR>

<BR>
The problem [I] have with MS is that they have made it SO hip and trendy and SO easy for anyone to get on the Internet with everything from their PC to their microwave.  Then if I come along and use any tool that you don't use or don't understand for WHATEVER purposes (including fixing your PC) I am automatically doing something I am not supposed to and I shouldn't be aloud to do my job.
<BR>

<BR>
Your proposal would ultimately limit me and other professionals not just end users.

<BR>
Tech 1:  "the server won't boot"

Tech 2:  "well I could fix it using the command prompt"

Clearly, you perceive Micro-Soft as the central authority figure in your life, with all the ambiguities and tensions that implies.  Whether you are a progammer or Net-Work Administrator is not at issue.  What is at issue is that you talk about this in terms of Micro-Soft choosing to take things away.  It doesn't work that way.  
<BR><BR>
We in our democracy come to a consensus on how we want our society to work, and then instruct our legislators to carry out our will.  Micro-Soft's role is to obey when our laws tell them what they may and may not include in their products.  "Hackers" too, must sooner or later reckon with our law, and if they cannot obey it, they will suffer all the consequences that result from the life of the outlaw.

First my personal life is none of your fucking business.  My father (if you must know) was the greatest part of my life.  He worked his ass off to send me to school.  I respect him above all others.  I therefore am missing nothing.
<BR>

<BR>
Second, we do not run MS prducts anywhere on ANY of our mission critical system.  And I think you need to examine your own posts as well as your original story.  You contradict yourself in so many ways.  Wehn you are proven to be utter ignorant about the things you discuss you (like the other adequacy.org morons) simply avoid the real issues and either result in "your anti-American", you're a homosexual hacker", or most of the time choose to not even answer the question at hand.
<BR>

<BR>
Let me pose this question to YOU.  What exactly is telnet?  What is the purpose of the command prompt?  And definitions like "it's a hacker tool blah blah blah..." you prove you are any idiot.  You calling View &gt;&gt; source a hacker already makes you one, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe if you were to actually look up the informtation you would find that these are tools that should not necessarily be limited to the MS friendly.
<BR>

<BR>
And if you so are looking for an multimedia point-and-click OS without the command prompt and all the supposed "hacker tools" I suggest simply foregoing Windows and install BeOS 5 Professional.
<BR>

<BR>
You know it amazes me that we never see a story about other OSes.  Why because the adequacy.org family knows nothing about computers and uses this site simply as a way to attack geeks (like myself, they're not just programmers, and geek is no longer an insult and hasn't been for year, wake up it's the 21st century) and Linux with misinformation and idiocy.  I mean have you ever even USED a Linux distro?  If so prove it.  How are the drive labeled in Linux?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway, I want to address your angry and obscenity-laden response to my questions about your background.

Now.  You protest rather much that you respect your father and have reason to be grateful for his sacrifices for your benefit.  Yet still you have this unreasoning binary reaction where everything is either pro-Micro-Soft or anti-Micro-Soft.  Why?
<BR><BR>
Guilt, number one.  Obviously you have repressed your feelings of resentment for the way your father has carried you along and made life so easy for you.  You know you are obliged to be grateful, but it sticks in your craw.  Without a way of processing these feelings, you re-direct them at an outward symbol of your father:  Micro-Soft.  Like your father, you respect Micro-Soft, and look to them as the touchstone of legitimacy.  Yet you resent them too, and have a knee-jerk reation to confront their power.
<BR><BR>
Are you afraid to discuss this openly with your real father?  Let's examine that fear.  What do you think would happen if you told him the truth about your feelings?
<BR><BR>
I wonder, too, if I had done <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=beginner+telnet">this</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=beginner+command+prompt">this</a> and simply copied and pasted whatever I found, would you have been impressed?

"Shit?"  Really?  I would say I hit the nail right on the proverbial head, my sick, neurotic, suffering friend.  I knew it had to be something like an absent father because a normal, healthy non-hacker just doesn't go around piling all those expectations and accusations about some software company, even a big one like Micro-Soft.  That would be like believeing that General Motors ran your life or something.  It is just not normal, and when you see it, you know there is something big wrong.

<BR>
He feels that you have unresolved issues and problems with avoidance.  This simple matter that you stray from the REAL subject and questions at hand delves into possible issues of avoidance rather than confrontation.  Rather than dealing with your own problem you simply create them for other people and dump them into their lap.  You also have trouble admitting when you are wrong yet continue to argue point no matter how ignorant you may be percieved by others.

I have worked in this industry longer than MS has been around.  So I know the truth about Microshaft's history.  It has nothing to do with a superior product.  It's superior MARKETING.

So yes, I'm avoiding the issue.  I brought it up, took on all comers, and defeated them in style.  Why beat a dead horse?  Why rest on my laurels?  Time to move on.  You'll notice Adequacy has put up several fine stories above this one, because the topic is simply done to death.
<BR><BR>
Now, about you.  Who ever asserted that Micro-Soft made superior products?  Why would anyone have even mentioned Micro-Soft at all in this discussion?  How anyone feels about the quality of Micro-Soft's products, or about their business practices has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of banning amateur programming.  You'll remember that the merits of Open Source are beside the point as well.  You could ban amateur programming and keep Open Source.
<BR><BR>
Yet you and dozens of other obviously compulsive individuals in a sheep-like fashion reacted to the threat posed by my ideas by mechanically trotting out your usual attacks against Micro-Soft and your timeworn defenses of Open Source.  <BR><BR>
Why?  Doesn't it bother you?  Why are "hackers" so predictable?  What drives them to react like a riled-up beehive or ant-nest?  Why the insect-like pre-programmed behavior?  Something is obviously wrong.  Anyone could see that.
<BR><BR>
Isn't it clear that it is an issue of power and control?  Doesn't the way that you and others suggest that I "propose it to Micro-Soft" as a way of denegrating my ideas show that while on the one hand you hate them, on the other you cower before their dominant role in your life.  Just like... what?  Like a father-figure, that's what.
<BR><BR>
And why would anyone cast a dumb soft-ware company in the role of his father?  How sick is that?  Well, they might if they had some kind of an absent father complex.  Like you, missing your father for the last 12 years and needing to deal with your guilt and resentment over the way he set you up in life in spite of your limited qualifications.  You should be grateful, and you say you are, but it makes it too hard for you to take pride in yourself, because you know that your dead, absent father is the one who really deserves all the credit.
<BR><BR>
Quite a load of baggage.  No wonder you have such a bizzare reaction to a dull, simple discussion of computer security, and run off attacking the Micro-Soft paper-tiger and having uncalled-for tanturms of obscene language and vile threats of violence.
<BR><BR>
I think it is a postitive sign that you can discuss this kind of thing with your own son.  Do you feel ready to talk about your jealousy of his success?  Who really deserves the credit here?  And remember, don't blame Micro-Soft for the conflicts between you and your son!  It's time to get past that, isn't it? <BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

Not gonna happen.  OPEN SOURCE = AVAILABLE TO E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt; This episode alone demonstrates that if there is anything good to come out of Open Source methodology, it will only be helped along by the removal of dilettantes from the picture. Indeed, once the "hackers" have been outlawed, Open Source will very likely reach new heights of utility and quality, and perhaps even fulfill the promise of greatness that Open Source advocates have been making for years.&gt;&gt;

So I guess that means that we shoudl fire the KERNEL HACKERS employed at Microsoft.  Not only that but it's not like someone changes something in the kernel then the community says "hey new version!"  Hell no.  It reviewed thoroughly by quite a few people and Linus (notice the S not an X) Torvalds with his Masters Degree in Computer Science, who holds the trademark on the the name Linux has the final say.
<BR>

<BR>
SOMEONE said that MS should be a standards setting organization when it comes to programming.  There are standards setting organizations around the world that MS must answer to.  How does this affect this?  This new protocol, is it compatible with this one?  Could THAT be the reason for someone saying submit it to MS?  Gee uhhh duhhh?
<BR>

<BR>
Also it's LINUX not Lunix, retard.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;It is time to ban all unlicensed computer programming, and take steps to ensure that no one outside of government, select universities, and state-sanctioned private-sector corporate software engineering facilities is given the knowledge, skills, or means to write or compile computer code of any kind. Amateur or hobbyist computer programming has grown from a minor annoyance to a major social disease, and it simply can no longer be tolerated.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Gary Kindell, a hobbyist wrote CP/M, the first OS for micro-computers, that was available to the general public, which paved the way for modern day PCs.  Without people like him there never would have been a market for computers for everyday folks.  Remember that the next time you sit at your PC.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;The first cry in defense of hobbyists toying with this dangerous technology is that hackers have already proven their worth by producing a valuable piece of software -- namely, the Apache web server. Others would even claim that more than one useful program has been written in the garages and and lonely bedrooms of hobbyists. There are two delusions at work here.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
See above response.  And oh, yeah I guess Gary Kindell being married was a lie.  And yes OSes like FreeBSD and others received ideas from amteurs.  It's a very useful OS.  Might be why MS used code from FreeBSD in their TCP/IP stack.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;&lt;One of these delusions is that any of the Open Source applications that have found some utility in business and industry were written by amateurs.&gt;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is used on a numerous mission critical and non mission critical systems around the world.  Linus Torvalds wrote the original Linux kernel BEFORE receiving his Masters Degree at age 21.  Can Bill Gates who wrote BASIC claim that?  No he dropped out of MIT.  OH MY GOSH!  HE DIDN'T FINISH!!!  Oh whoppee, he's got an HONORARY DEGREE.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This is what interests me.  Silly legends about some obscure hobbyist who wants to steal credit for the PC revolution from IBM and Apple don't interest me.  We all know "hackers" steal anything that isn't nailed down, especially credit.  It's boring to hear the same hyperbole ad nausaeum.
<BR><BR>
But why obsess over Micro-Soft?   Why not address the broader issues at hand?  I'm suggesting re-examining the basic assumptions about computers in our society, and you go into spasms with the shift key held down so you can fire off invective against who...? Micro-Soft.  Again, and again, it always comes back to Micro-Soft.
<BR><BR>
Everything this one company does is all that matters to you.  It's like some kind of weird religion:  this paranoid Micro-Soft cult, with Micro-Soft as the jealous, vengeful god who is both feared and adored at the same time.  For a while I thought your anger would lead us to something productive, but it seems you have become locked in a repetitive loop, and can't escape.  In your mind is only firey rage and Micro-Soft and I don't see how you can make any progress stuck in that state.

Man are you a stupid ass or what?  Gary Kindell worte CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers) using PL/M (Programming Language for Microcomputers).  Intel bought PL/M from him you retard.  He later started his own company called Digital Research which Novell bought (after his death).  DR-DOS, ever heard of it?  The DR stands for Digital Research.
<BR>

<BR>
Seattle Computer Company backwards engineers CP/M taking ideas from CP/M-86 to develop  QDOS which MS bought for $50,000.  Gary Kindell later sued MS.  MS and Kindell settled out of court.
<BR>

<BR>
If it wasn't for pioneers like him geeks like Gary Kindell markets for Personal Computers like the Altair (which MS wrote BASIC for) and hobbyist kits which led to the first Apple would never have existed.

<BR>
Oh and just for the guy writing about the creator of CP/M obviously that was from an article by someone like you guys who can't spell.  It's likely he remembers CP/M just not it's creator.  His name is spelled Gary Kildall.  If you want info about him I suggest reading (on the internet), The History of the PC or The History of MS-DOS.  Or you can read The Perfect Architecture in the Sept 2001 issue of PC Magazine.  You can find programs for CP/M and computers running CP/M all over e-Bay.  And just because you don't know who he is you shouldn't assume someone else doesn't remember him.

Actually the inventor of the GUI was Douglas Englebart.  Xerox only perfected the GUI (the look) for WORKSTATIONS not PCs.  He showcased it back in December of 1968.  Engelbart's mouse was about the size of an adult hand.  It didn't go over well with some people.  Engelbart laid the foundations not Xerox.
<BR>

IBM tinkered as well.  You think they went into business and just made a great computer?  Hell, took them years to release a decent PC, the PC-XT in 83.  Oh and Kildall DID WIN.  MS paid him quite a chunk of change.  That's what settling out of court means.  It's means MS admitted the QDOS and MS-DOS kernels were nothing but the CP/M kernel compiled to run on Intel's 8086 processor.  They just didn't want it to show up in official court documents.  But Kildall made sure people knew.  Apple mass produced quite a few models before IBMs success.

If you are so damned worried about someone gaining access to you account then simply tell your netork administrator to disable the items in question so that you (and anyone using your account) cannot access them.

<BR>
command prompt
<BR>
telnet

<BR>
program installation

Oh and the title of your article is stupid.  Programmers and hacking?  Network Administrators (and even your beloved MCSEs) know more about hacking that a vast majority of programmers.
<BR>

<BR>
Most programmers don't know what tracert, or ping does (both used everyday by the "good guys") or what packet sniffers are.  Hell most programmers don't even know what a packet IS.  It's usually the Networking guys that point out the security holes in things like Microshaft's IIS.  Hell most of this stuff is taught in the beginning of most networking classes.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You couldn't possibly take Windows back to a state directly after installation while saving your data through a process called System 1st (done bu copying the system.1st file from the windows directory over the system.dat file in C:\).  Why?  Because you can't access the command prompt.

Maybe you have installed W2K or XP using FAT32 but have decided you want to convert the file system to NTFS5 instead.  You need the command prompt.

Don't even get me started on TELNET but NotePad!?!  Yes the only thing it is good for is hacking.  WROOOOOONG!  It's great for viewing txt (text) files rather quickly.  But you'd rather wait for your Office Suite to load instead.

MAYBE if more if you used something older than Windows 9x you would have worked with DOS (or any pre-DOS OS like CP/M or UNIX).  Then maybe you wouldn't be so ignorant.

Fine. You seem to have some sense of what the "mysterious" hackers of our world are capable of, but what you talk about is merely scratching the surface. Hackers have compromised government databases, corporate lists of credit card numbers, credit companies, etc etc. Nothing is secure if it connects to the internet. Yes, you probably already know that. But an important point that you fail to mention is that most hacks are unknown. When a hacker comes along and is successful, he doesn't "make his mark" all the time. He doesn't deface a website or delete vital company information. Leave that to the kiddies.

You and your social planners are incapable of determining what people will or will not learn. These new laws that you wish to enact will have to be extremely invasive on the personal freedoms of the citizens of the United States. Do you really think that the government can control what people read? Do you really think there will be no violent revolt if the Federal government were to try put in place such laws? People cannot be controlled to that extent (yes I know thats what they probably said about television), but this is different. This would require not only apathy about current events, this would require complete ignorance of the constitution and the bill of rights by every respectable person inside the US. Do you really think the feds can pull that kind of mind control off? I don't.
<BR>

<BR>
You wrote this article because you were controlled by a SubSeven or something, right? You're pissed because some little script kiddie was able to take control of you computer or something, right?
<BR>

<BR>
I'm having trouble understanding your motivation for writing such inanities!
<BR>

<BR>
But you talked about denial of service. I personally have never met a computer connected to the internet that couldn't be crashed with a single packet of one configuration or another. Will the government take control over all internet traffic under your plan? Will we ban all subversive content too? Anything that doesn't go along with "faith-based" government will have to be punished, right? Send a certain packet, go to jail. Hey, its the law!
<BR>

You cannot control what people know, and you cannot control what people learn. If you try to do such a thing, you will be violently murdered.

However, this should be ramped up to examine both the maximum and minimum extremes. Calibrate yourself with maximum and minimum by associating the maximum with licensing individual existence or life and minimum with complete lack of any form of licensing.


<BR><BR>
In the scenario based on the minimum possibility, modernized nations would never be able to maintain unity. Instead of corporations, which congeal individual human talent to create a handful of visible entities for a government to observe and guide, extreme numbers of cabals would be warring amongst themselves. In comparison to corporations, the possibility that a few of the tiny groups using technological advances with no moral integrity for purposes which would be catastrophic in effect to the rest of the population is increased greatly. Angst-ridden people whom have not matured to a point of respect for others and solidarity of the infrastructure could easily cause irreparable damage. Can you imagine the government trying to investigate a hundred thousand companies for fraud or dangerous activities?


<BR><BR>
As for the maximum scenario, there becomes a focal point for everything. With this comes safety. With safety comes progress and productivity. If people are afraid to leave a shelter because of ominous threats ensuing during anarchy, nothing will be done. Little to no manufacturing, schooling, governing, etc... A dark age, if you will.


<BR><BR>
Starting from either the minimum or maximum societies, they will both progress toward an equilibrium between the two. Licensing everything moves toward licensing most things. Breathing is no longer a federally regulated activity. On the other hand, licensing nothing becomes a semi-organized and regulated collective. As opposed to everything forming a lake, we now have a crafted mountain which focuses creative energies. At the risk of sounding blasphemous, essentially creating something from nothing.


<BR><BR>
Having been extemely general allows for an easier comprehension of the capacities of the two camps, as well as the tradeoffs inherent in each. Increasing the granularity to examine individual fields of study, we can find very similar scenarios playing out. Within chemistry, for example, licensing is required to obtain certain key components of dangerous or illegal products. This would be an example of relatively heavy licensing restrictions, somewhat on par with the overall capacity for negative in the nature of the field, combined with the average tendencies of human nature to abuse and misuse knowledge.


<BR><BR>
Light licensing can be found in the ability to write. Pen and paper are not difficult to acquire at all. As long as the monetary compensation is provided, anyone can use the materials. This is in the best interest of the majority, as most are not likely to remember entire volumes of documents. Therefore, the pen and paper are very valuable as tools and highly unlikely to be abused or misused. That can be debated, depending on the context in which the abuse or misuse is taken.


<BR><BR>
When appeasing the majority, it is difficult to observe the fringes. For every person categorized as a genius by any given society, there are likely several or perhaps a great many within the same society whom are as intelligent, if not moreso. Yet even though they are of such grandiose capacity, they are suffocated by their own inconsistencies within the society. While not being in the majority, they end up outcast and look back with confusion and revulsion. Some are happy in this position, whereas some will attack the status quo.


<BR><BR>
Licensing, which would allow a document to reward an individual with recognition as an expert, can be exceedingly difficult to even attempt obtaining. For the individuals mentioned above, it seems that the society and world at large are proliferated by corruption and injustice when they are not noticed because their situation is not evaluated thoroughly. Every time they attempt to start scaling the mountainous path to the status of an educated expert, they find the mountain to be covered in loose gravel such that they cannot get any footing. It is more than an uphill battle. It becomes a struggle to survive, which squanders much of the potential. Oftentimes, it becomes such that the individual is embittered. Much like an intelligent child being held back in school, many in this society find it difficult to be noticed enough to excell at their interest, or even discover their primary field of aptitude. There are numerous attempts to expose what social placing a person would find rewarding, but there is only so much that written exams and interviews can uncover.


<BR><BR>
When the aforementioned individuals cannot give themselves peace of mind through a particular intellectual persuit using standard methods, some seek out the information through other means. Some turn to substances, others force themselves into other fields of study and there are even those who fill themselves with despair to the point of ending their own lives. If the person is not interested in intellectual persuit, there are many social outlets and other paths for that person to follow. Again, even that path is not enough at times for those mostly content with it. It would be an injustice to those who fall through the cracks to not examine every possibility.


<BR><BR>
Coming back to the proposition for banning programming, I did offer the stance that I agree. In light of a more extensive analysis by examining more than the computer industry, I must say that I only agree in the short term. Banning the practice, while producing a sense of safety, would only alienate an entire subculture which is critical to the infrastructure of modern nations. It would also be a predominantly false sense of security, as any nation which places severe restrictions on cutting edge activities pays the price when other nations allow interested individuals to continue exploration of the subject in question, of their own accord. As time progresses, more effective dealings with the activity of programming will be discovered and set in place. However, this progress will be partially stagnated by the prerequisite of a funded education. If anyone who has ever invested in the technology sector and benefited while maintaining the stance of licensing software creation, I would have to deem him a hypocrit.


<BR><BR>
There is a need for technology sector workers which is largely unfulfilled. People with an interest most often make the best workers for the appropriate field. A mention on the elimination of computers caught my attention. This would be an appealing thought, if only society could survive without them. Currently, things will collapse in on themselves with the removal of what has become such an integral thread of modern infrastructure. The future holds promise, but even greater peril. Not everyone wants to experience the unknown. The future is a form of the unknown which has proven inevitable, while some still are afraid of making headway toward it. I did not choose to realize the horrifying threat of biological weapons, but I appreciate the benefits of studies within the realm of chemistry which have afforded, among other things, efficient manufacturing methods and greater understanding of the world around us. Granted, computers can be miserably burdensome, but what of the maintenance of power stations? They serve a critical function, and as such require attention so as to remain functional. Should an individual change during the course of his lifetime, he might require a career change as well. Would it be better for this person to be able to do some research on the subject first, or simply sink his savings into something which may quickly turn out to be a nightmare in disguise? At this point, conjecture is counter-productive and too specific, so I digress. Dams have had their share of <a href="http://www.santapaulatimes.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/2713.html">
disasters</a>. Experimentation and exploration need to occur in order for safety and stability to be achieved. The industry surrounding the information infrastructure is at a similar stage, and as such requires observation as opposed to blundering interference. Telling a child that he is supposed to be seen and not heard is a good way to risk wedging the child into a harshly self-imposed introversion. That child may then be maladjusted to society in general. Therefore, the key is balance.


<BR><BR>
What do you, as the original poster of this view, perceive as something which should be left alone? I'm reasonably sure that anything can be attacked with the same fervor and ignorance so as to be presented as a dangerous or evil action. For demagogues who persist in enforcing their own desires upon others, the only requirement for blinding and confusing many is an understanding of semantics. The omission of an alternate stance is the antithesis of democracy, which most here seem to exalt, yet it still seems that a comprehensive analysis is so often forgotten in the fervor of zealotry.


<BR><BR>
It is no small feat to reorganize an entire subculture around a geographically localized point. By this fact, laws would likely be more effective were they made more flexible instead of oppressive.


<BR><BR>
This all comes back to social underpinnings which have brought about a proliferation of opinions and ideas, but still promotes a lack of flexibility in regard to the passionate guarding of one's favorite ideas. I've said it before and I'll say it again; money will be lost, governments will fall and people will die - change takes time and some individuals never will. The only thing to do is keep plodding on. If we stop, then change will not happen and things will not get better.


<BR><BR>
During the course of time that it took me to get through all the interruptions to finally commit this, all of the major points have probably already been discussed. Nonetheless, here goes! Let the nitpicking begin.

I believe wholeheartedly in this.  If I'm doing something in everyday life (ie: say, being a Linux user, and using DeCSS to watch a DVD), I ignore the appropriate law.  If someone catches me (bloody unlikely), I accept arrest.  This does NOT mean I don't fight the law (literal, not symbolic of the police officers doing their job) that has placed me under arrest, I merely don't fight the immediate consequence.  I would appeal to the supreme court (if necessesary) that I was only excersising my rights under the license of the DVD, and I believe that I would win.

IDE
<BR>
Abbreviation of either Intelligent Drive Electronics or Integrated Drive Electronics, depending on who you ask. An IDE interface is an interface for mass storage devices, in which the controller is integrated into the disk or CD-ROM drive.
<BR>

<BR>
Although it really refers to a general technology, most people use the term to refer the ATA specification, which uses this technology.

In the computer software world, <b>IDE</b> stands for <em>Integrated Development Environment</em>. An <b>IDE</b> has several components. First, it contains a source editor which usually has syntax highlighting for easier reading. Next, a compiler or interpreter is included, depending on the language. Finally, a debugger to facilitate rapid bug fixing. There are other optional parts, but these three normally form the core.

There are none. What reason do you have for thinking Utopias are possible or that China will not in the future challenge the quality of life Americans enjoy in the present?

This is a dumb thing to say.  The Earth has the largest GDP in the world, but most people on Earth are destitute. 
GDP is a factor  in a nation's development index,   but it is not <i>the</i> measure of development by any means.
Are you not intelligent enough to realize that 1.2 billion people must share the value of all final goods and services produced in China, vs. 30 million in the case of Canada?

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">ok... this site is pushing the limits, and reaching new grounds in misinformation... mostly thanks to elenchos who knows little to nothing about anything involving computers and technology. First off, your little cruisade to put an end to software development won't work, and it can't work. There is no way to control the development of software, and if you outlaw it, you will push it to the underground where you won't want it to be. trust me.  Then you will only have malicious users writing open software, and won't have the good guys (the current majority) to balance out the equation.  Might as well throw the internet out the window.
<BR>

<BR>
"One of these delusions is that any of the Open Source applications that have found some utility in business and industry were written by amateurs." 
<BR>

<BR>
Not true... nobody is telling you that... Most open source developers are very experienced and good at what they do... 
<BR>

<BR>
"The truth is that Apache began it's life as the work of professional coders employed by Amazon.com, and as any software engineer you want to ask can tell you, nothing of value was added by anyone but professionals. In truth, the work of the gainfully employed programmers on this project was often interrupted and even sabotaged by the ham-fisted meddling of the teenage wanna-be's and self-styled "gurus" who have accumulated around professional Open Source projects like so many leeches and barnacles. This episode alone demonstrates that if there is anything good to come out of Open Source
<BR>
methodology, it will only be helped along by the removal of dilettantes from the picture. Indeed, once the "hackers" have been outlawed, Open Source will very likely reach new heights of utility and quality, and perhaps even fulfill the promise of greatness that Open Source advocates have been making for
<BR>
years." 
<BR>

<BR>
Come on... you are making it too easy for me. Do you just make this stuff up, or are you actually reading these "facts" somewhere? EVERYONE... go to apache.org and see how much mention of amazon.com there is. Apache was around for years before Amazon.com was, and I think you are confusing apache with something else (one click shopping maybe?). Infact, I used apache for my websites before amazon did, and I was like 15. hehe 
<BR>

<BR>
You don't give many examples of opensource software that people might know about... Let me start with say, the website that you are posting this message to. It is some way came from slashcode (or one of the php or python knockoffs). This actual website was developed from none other than opensource software. If the web admin tells you that the idea was all his own, he is lying. Just visit slashcode.org and take a look at that opensource project. Apache is a great example, you just don't have a clue about it. Could you please point me in the direction of some documents that state apache came from amazon? I need a good laugh (especially since losing two friends in the WTC attack), and I am sure any of the developers from amazon would join me. If you would like a nice complete list of opensource software go to freshmeat.net, but I will continue to add a few others. How about Mozilla? It is an excellent web browser that a lot of you may or may not have heard of. Netscape is the production version of Mozilla. Um... Sendmail ring a bell? Not that I even really like sendmail, but it is the most popular mail server out there. Almost any e-mail you read passes through atleast one sendmail box. You are also leaving out Linux, but I know how much you love that. Many companies use linux for production servers. I am not going to continue to go on anymore, like I said check out freshmeat for a complete list. 
<BR>

<BR>
Who cares about emacs, I don't use it much but thousands do... I prefer Vi. Both are opensource, and very respected pieces of software. Yeah, so a lot of emacs development was done at MIT... a lot of opensource software is created at Universities... What's your point? 
<BR>

<BR>
"There are dozens, even hundreds of these types of destructive programs in circulation, such as those mentioned, as well as the notorious "Back Orifice", or the hacker operating system, "Lunix". While a "hacker" could disingenuously and spuriously argue that each one of these various illegal programs has some redeeming social value, it is clear that taken as a whole, such "warez" do not in fact benefit anyone except "hackers" and other criminals." 
<BR>

<BR>
I wouldn't call Linux a hacker OS, but you don't even know what hacking is. You confuse malicious users with hackers. They aren't one and the same.
<BR>
Putting Linux (or Lunix as you put it) and Back Orifice in the same sentence is wack. First off Back Orifice has nothing to do with Linux and infact it is distributed as a Windows binary from what I recall... I haven't used it myself, because I am a Linux "Junkie" as you like to put it. You don't take a look at these things long enough to make proper judgement on them. Linux is a operating system just like windows... neither one is more dangerous than the other. If everyon ran linux, there would be less hacks and less attacks, because it just isn't as easy to write a virus for linux... That is why there are zero viruses for linux ZERO! You think that these people that write viruses actually write them on linux? Maybe a few, but not many... I am sure pleanty of them haven't even touched linux before. 
<BR>

<BR>
"Is there a right to "hack"? Well, of course there most certainly is not." 
<BR>

<BR>
That isn't true... I do have every right to hack if I want... If I add a few lines of code to the Apache server project, that is hacking, but it isn't illegal. All code is, is just code... letters, numbers, and symbols written out on an electronic piece of paper like artwork or a novel. It is the act of transfering an idea to paper basically, and I have the right to do that. Even if I write a piece of code that can be used to take down an unpached dns server it is still legal. It would be illegal for me to take that code and execute it on a yahoo!'s dns server to bring it down without their permission. 
<BR>

<BR>
"Absolutely. There is no better time than now. As we have seen by the recent mass murders by terrorists, computer technology is a mainstay of criminals, and they rely most on such "free" tools as text editors and military-grade encryption programs that "hackers" use simply because they think it is cute to play
<BR>
with such power. But the rest of society has lost patience with this childish diddling, and the civilized world has said unequivocally that we want strong legal safeguards enacted to put an end to "hacking" and terrorism. We most especially have no qualms about banning activities like playing with explosives or
<BR>
creating software when these so-called "hobbies" are restricted to a tiny fringe element who for whatever reason gets no pleasure from healthy pastimes like fly fishing or drinking alcohol at gentlemen's clubs." 
<BR>

<BR>
Again, I must ask, "are you kidding me?" How does the world trade center attack show us that "computer technology is a mainstay of criminals?" Do you know something that FBI and I don't know? Where did you read that the terrorists used linux and/or free software? As far as I can tell they used planes, but I may be wrong... Maybe they ping flooded the WTC down. Hmmm... They didn't use text editors... hehe There is speculation that they may have used some encryption to transfer data, but that means nothing. I mean the encryption algorithms hardly have anything to do with the actual attack. From what I have read, Bin Laden actually tried to stay away from as much technology as possible, because they know how easy it is to intercept. 
<BR>

<BR>
"Put simply, normal folks are not going to let themselves get blown up because a tiny minority of freaks like to "hack". If you aren't willing to code for Uncle Sam, then don't code at all." 
<BR>

<BR>
Put simply, "Witch Hunt!"  What happened to life , liberty, and the persuit of happiness?  I use coding as my livelyhood, and it is how I persue these things... It is my right.  I don't break the law with my code... not in the least. 
<BR>

<BR>
Who are you anyway? Why don't you ask the corporations of america (even those that get attacked regularly) what they would prefer. I guarentee you that they understand (unlike you) that opensource has made it possible for them to do business, period. You really don't understand how widespread it is. I have been on that side, the side being attacked, and I wouldn't for a second blame it on open source. Why? Because I understand what is going on, and you don't. It is that simple. So take a step back and think for a second before you start this witch hunt. You don't understand what you are writing about and are doing serious damage. I don't for a second think that your freedom of speech should be taken away because you use it to do harm rather than spread truth. Why don't you give me that same chance with my code? 
<BR>

<BR>
Like I have said in the past, you are afraid and now I feel you are weak. Since you fear what I know and you don't know, you want to destroy things that I enjoy. I am a good person. I donate money, blood, and time for the good of the world. I stand up against injustices and I am standing up against you. I am vegetarian for the good of the world, and I am a hacker for the good of the world... I am not afraid of you, because you cause has no steam, it especially pales in comparison to the drive of the open source MOVEMENT. I want to deliver information for free to those that can't afford it, and there is nothing wrong with that... no matter what you say.

This whole ad homeniem attack with regard to the origin of Apache is yet another distraction from the issue.

And so what if there was some prototype Apache code out there before it was put into actual productive use at Amazon.com? Where did it originate then?  In the basement of a self-taught "hacker" with a ratty beard?  Sorry, no.  It began at the NCSA.  And what does NCSA stand for?  It is the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, which is at the U of  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  How much more establishment can you get?

It all comes down to free speech.  One, code is not speech.  Speech is done in human language, not in instructions to machines.  The courts have made this clear.  And two, even if it were speech, is it harmful speech?  Why yes, it is.  
<BR><BR>
For example, if PGP is so useless, then let's outlaw it.  Obviously, if as you claim, it is of no use to terrorists, because it is so easily intercepted, then no one will miss it.  Or else perhaps it <i>is</i> useful to terrorists, in which case it is harmful.  Ban it either way.
<BR><BR>
I fail to understand how "hackers" can so easily dismiss the billions of dollars lost to things like the Code Red Worm.  If it was you getting laid off because your company's profits had sunk too low in this virus and worm filled environment, perhaps you would care.  Maybe it is because "hackers" don't have real jobs in the tech sector anyway, so they never feel it.

And then what about the future?  What about when someone breaks into a nuclear plant's computers, or shuts down air traffic control computers, or kills the power grid, or a hospital's computers?

but you call for a ban on programming...  the companies that use it aren't the ones that write it.  It gets written by people at home!  I am serious.  Some things get added to it at universities and companies, but much of it is developed in peoples spare time.  Opensource programmers are often not on the clock.  The people that develop software weren't always pro's.  A lot of them get there start by creating open source software.  The fact that BIG companies USE opensource software (NOT WRITE it) proves my point.  People are doing a lot of work for these companies in their own time without getting paid.

They are a hacker outfit... If you ask all of the coders that worked on any of those projects at those places if they considered themselves hackers, I bet well over 50% would say, "sure."  My point is you don't know what a hacker is, so how can you say that?

there was much more than some prototype Apache code.. It was DONE before Amazon.com even existed... It isn't like Amazon had anything to do with it.  There have been many features and fixes added, but it was a fully functional server with most of the features it has today before Amazon existed.

<BR>
Ok let me explain to this in terms you may be able to understand.  The few that I listed are older, more mature projects.  Yes, most of them were started at universities and companies at one point, but since then people all over the world have been adding code to them from home.  Most of the real breakthroughs have happened since the projects have become more puplic.  There are some projects that were started at home like the gimp and enlightenment and gnome, and debian linux for example that will in time mature and become as well known as the projects you speak of.  You just have to give it time.  These pieces of software are big parts of my computer, but maybe not yours.  That doesn't mean that they are any less genious.

<BR>

<BR>
I didn't say it was useless... I said that there is no proof that they used any such thing.  PGP is very useful, and I am sure that terrorists could find is useful as well as the president himself.  Many things are useful to terrorists.  Take planes for instance... They actually used planes to fly into the WTC do you think that we should get rid of planes?  No, why?  because planes are so useful to you.

<BR>

<BR>
Code Red Worm is a MS thing, so it wouldn't affect any of my systems.  It was written for a closed sourced system on a closed source system with a closed source language.  Any companies I worked for have systems that wouldn't be affected by Code Red Worm... That is why I am good to have around... That is also why I didn't get layed off.

Awww... then poor me has to come back to hawaii and start working on his new project.  I am a hacker, and companies have had good luck with me.

Those are bad people and they should be punished.  If people want to do that, then they will have to work hard to get there.  If they are that driven to do something then they will find some way to do it.  You problem is that you underestimate these malicious people, thinking they are dumb druggies with long beards.  You are doing the same thing we did with terrorists...  They are all around you, blending in, being normal.  Your run of them mill, lazy, drunk/druggie script kiddie is nothing to worry about.  They can do little more than causing sites to run slow and the like...  The people to look out for are the smart and driven but evil people.

I just have a question for you though.  You say that all this software like Apache and Emacs... is created by professionals at companies and universities.  What makes you think that viruses don't come from the same place?
<BR>

<BR>
The problem with making coding illegal is that you will upset the delicate balance on the net between good and evil hackers.  Most of the good guys will probably stop hacking because the don't want to go to jail.  That will only leave the bad guys to run wild and not be challanged by smart people on the other side.
<BR>

<BR>
Do you see what I am saying?  I can see you calling for stronger punishment for computer crimes.  I wouldn't object to that, but to just say that people can't do it without going to a university or working for a big company/government organization is wrong.  I wouldn't have gotten where I am today or even close if I wasn't allowed to tinker with linux back when I was in high school.  I would have done what every other kid around me was doing (drugs).  I understand you may have grown up as part of the upper class and everything was polo and golf, but I was poor for a big chunk of my childhood.  I have used technology to provide myself a good life.  All I want to do is give back to technology by coding... What is wrong with that?

Kinda like how Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Traf-O-Data (which became Micro-Soft which later became Microsoft) out of their college dorm room.  Oh sorry, most of the adequacy.org family probably has never used anything prior to Windows 9x.  They wrote BASIC (a programming language).  Maybe I should talk about how they ran their business out of a hotel for almost a year.

If this ban would have been enacted back then you would not even know who Bill Gates was.  Hell you'd likely be running CP/M-86 right now since QDOS (MS bought this for $50,000 and called it DOS) was a backwards engineered CP/M.  Hell you wouldn't even be using that because it along with PL/M was written as a HOBBY by Gary Kindell.

We know this because they had university degrees and worked in established research institutions.  That a small portion of them want to be labeled "hackers" are like Harvard freshmen in phat baggy pants who want to be called "G".  They are just play-acting because it embarrases them to be part of the system.
<BR><BR>
But you suppose that some amateurs made a contribution too.  You're just sure of it, yet where is the evidence?  All you have is some Open Source projects that seem to be progressing, and some code that you don't know for certain that it came from a pro.  So you just assume, based on nothing, that it must have been written by a hobbyist.  Why assume that?  Only becuase it is a part of the romantic "hacker" myth of the underdog who comes out of nowhere and saves the day.
<BR><BR>
Yet every time we <i>can</i> look a the provenance of a useful piece of code, we discover that it did come from a real programmer.  All the hard data we have says real software engineers are the ones who make Open Source work.  The only way to give any credit to the tinkerers is to either lie (a popular choice) or to just give them the benefit of the doubt when there is no proof either way.
<BR><BR>
Who is capable of believeing such flimsy reasoning?  Only "hackers".  Only a "hacker" would start making up fairy tales about professionals writing viruses.  Only a "hacker" would dream that somewhere out there are some mythical "white hats" keeping the evil ones at bay.  So now your justification for letting bungling fools play with dangerous technology is a pure fantasy and speculation?

Let me start with an e-mail from Linus Torvalds himself talking about the first steps of his hobby.
<BR>

<BR>
From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
<BR>
Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
<BR>
Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?
<BR>
Summary: small poll for my new operating system
<BR>
Message-ID: &lt;1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI&gt;<BR>
Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT
<BR>
Organization: University of Helsinki
<BR>

<BR>
Hello everybody out there using minix -
<BR>
I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing
<BR>
since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons among other things).
<BR>
I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and
<BR>
I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)
<BR>
Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)
<BR>
PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never
<BR>
will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.
<BR>

<BR>
notice how he says just a hobby?  Just like 80%-90% of the other opensource people out there.
<BR>

<BR>
you can read more @ http://www.li.org/linuxhistory.php
<BR>

<BR>
Now, I am not in any way claiming that Linus is still an amateur, but this quote is from when he was nothing more than a nerdy hacker (even hobbyist).  Linux was obviously STARTED as a hobby.
<BR>

<BR>
------
<BR>

<BR>
"Yet every time we can look a the provenance of a useful piece of code, we discover that it did come from a real programmer. All the hard data we have says real software engineers are the ones who make Open Source work."
<BR>

<BR>
I never said they didn't come from real programmers!  Ofcourse, a "fake" programmer can't write real code.  I have a problem with you saying that the only good that has come from opensource was done under the watchful eye of some university or large corporation.  The truth is, a lot of "real" programmers program in their spare time as a hobby.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, to clear up the whole hacker BS, lets consult the "pros", GNU the people that pretty much started it all.
<BR>

<BR>
these are all quotes from the GNU site, and proper links are attached.
<BR>

<BR>
"(1) The use of "hacker" to mean "security breaker" is a confusion on the part of the mass media. We hackers refuse to recognize that meaning, and continue using the word to mean, "Someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever about it.""
<BR>

<BR>
I urge you to educate yourself on what hackers are by reading http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html
<BR>

<BR>
It also gives you a little info on what it was like before free software was popular, and why they needed to do what they do... they needed to hack.  If they didn't, we would be nowhere near where we are today.  Sure, some of them may have jobs and some go to school, but they are just people, and they hack in their free time.
<BR>

<BR>
"The idea that the proprietary software social system--the system that says you are not allowed to share or change software--is antisocial, that it is unethical, that it is simply wrong, may come as a surprise to some readers. But what else could we say about a system based on dividing the public and keeping users helpless? Readers who find the idea surprising may have taken proprietary social system as given, or judged it on the terms suggested by proprietary software businesses. Software publishers have worked long and hard to convince people that there is only one way to look at the issue."
<BR>

<BR>
"What does society need? It needs information that is truly available to its citizens---for example, programs that people can read, fix, adapt, and improve, not just operate. But what software owners typically deliver is a black box that we can't study or change.
<BR>

<BR>
Society also needs freedom. When a program has an owner, the users lose freedom to control part of their own lives.
<BR>

<BR>
And above all society needs to encourage the spirit of voluntary cooperation in its citizens. When software owners tell us that helping our neighbors in a natural way is ``piracy'', they pollute our society's civic spirit.
<BR>

<BR>
This is why we say that free software is a matter of freedom, not price."

Ok, ever hear of apple computers?  Steve Jobs?  Lets take a look at how he got started... The first apple computers, a hobby?  hmmm...
<BR>

<BR>
APPLE COMPUTERS
<BR>

<BR>
Steven Wozniak and Steven Jobs had been friends in high school. They had both been interested in electronics, and both had been perceived as outsiders. They kept in touch after graduation, and both ended up dropping out of school and getting jobs working for companies in Silicon Valley. (Woz for Hewlett-Packard, Jobs for Atari)
<BR>

<BR>
Wozniak had been dabbling in computer-design for some time when, in 1976, he designed what would become the Apple I. Jobs, who had an eye for the future, insisted that he and Wozniak try to sell the machine, and on April 1, 1976, Apple Computer was born.
<BR>

<BR>
Hobbyists did not take the Apple I very seriously, and Apple did not begin to take off until 1977, when the Apple II debuted at a local computer trade show. The first personal computer to come in a plastic case and include color graphics, the Apple II was an impressive machine. Orders for Apple machines were multiplied by several times after its introduction. And with the introduction in early '78 of the Apple Disk II, the most inexpensive, easy to use floppy drive ever (at the time), Apple sales further increased.
<BR>

Let's take a look at some of the current mozilla developers!  NCSA developers as you say?  Funny there was no mention of the NCSA on their site.  Could you please post where you got info on the ties to the NCSA?
<BR>

<BR>
MOZILLA (www.mozilla.org)
<BR>

<BR>
The Mozilla community includes all those who contribute to Mozilla: writing code, testing software, writing documentation, developing web pages and applications, advocating on behalf of Mozilla, or doing any of the multitude of other things that help make Mozilla useful and successful. SOME PARTICIPATE AS INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTEERS, some through their educational institution, and others work at commercial companies.
<BR>

<BR>
These actions ultimately determine the direction of the Mozilla project, through the contributions made and through participation in the Mozilla discussion groups and mailing lists where the day-to-day activity takes place.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Chris Blizzard (blizzard@mozilla.org)
<BR>
    Chris hacks on various parts of Mozilla. The straight Xlib port of Mozilla is mostly his fault. He also hacks on the gtk port when it really needs help and people ask really nicely. He dreams of things like adding Web DAV support and other fun network features. He also dreams about the directions the mozilla project could take and what we can accomplish.
<BR>

<BR>
        Chris has been using Linux and open software since the 0.99 days. Starting as a user he self taught himself programming and now hacks on various projects when he has time. He's been working with Mozilla code since the source was released. In the past he's played roles as a sysadmin, web jockey, database programmer and project manager.
<BR>

<BR>
clearly a hacker with no motivation from a corp or an edu.
<BR>

<BR>
Mike Shaver (shaver@mozilla.org)
<BR>
    shaver is the token Canadian. By day he hangs out with the Mozilla development community, listening to what people are using Mozilla code for, what they're working on, what works and what doesn't. By night, he hacks the code and occasionally fixes things. Mostly, he focuses on giving out guidance and T-shirts, in approximately equal quantities.
<BR>

<BR>
        Mike is a veteran of the free software (especially Linux) scene, and was a loud and persistent champion of free software within Netscape. Before Netscape, Mike played CTO for a little Canadian consulting company called Ingenia (now a part of Software Kinetics).

XFREE86
<BR>

<BR>
XFree86 is basically the windows part of UNIX/Linux.  There are a few non-free competetors, but Xfree86 is the most widespread version of X-Windows, and it is completely open source.  It was started in 1992 by a group of 4 people.  David Dawes is the "president" of XFree86 and is currently unemployed... his last job was working at VA Linux... basically he is just a hacker too
<BR>

<BR>
here is a piece of an interview where he talks about how he got started:
<BR>

<BR>
"Q: how did you get started with xfree86?
<BR>

<BR>
Back in 1991 before Linux was around I was running System V Release 3 and later 4 for PC - this was the only unix you could get. Thomas Roell, who got everything started, he wrote an X server for these operating systems, and when X11R5 came out he included his code in that release. It was the first time an X release had code for PCs.
<BR>

<BR>
There were a lot of variations between the different vendors, so X didn't really run very well on the machine I was using. I wanted to make it work so I started getting into it and fixing stuff up.
<BR>

<BR>
Then there were a couple of other guys (Glenn Lai, Jim Tsillas) who started improving the perfomance of it, independently, and a fourth guy (David Wexelblat) who was interested in getting stuff working. He got all of us together, to co-ordinate what we were doing, and that's where it all started.
<BR>

<BR>
We just started by releasing patches for the other code."
<BR>

<BR>
As you can see, they didn't do it for school or work, but to make it function well on their machines, like so many other open source developers.  Little of this could have been done without the free tools from GNU written by hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
"Q: how many copies of X are there out there now?
<BR>

<BR>
No idea.
<BR>

<BR>
Q: there must be millions?
<BR>

<BR>
That would be my guess. How many copies of linux are there out there?"
<BR>

<BR>
millions... that is a lot people running the software those few people started in the privacy of their own home.  I would say that these few hackers have made a big difference in the UNIX/Linux world.  This is actually a project I can say I have participated in by offering bug fixes and device drivers I made in my spare time.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
ENLIGHTENMENT PROJECT
<BR>

<BR>
Enlightenment is stunning window manager for UNIX/Linux.  It was written completely from scratch by two hackers (raster and mandrake or Carsten Haitzler an dGeoff Harrison).  They are just hobbists, and now that people see how amazing it is, they have had many more join in.  You can see a long list at enlightenment developers... some work, some go to school, and some just hack.
<BR>

<BR>
www.enlightenment.org
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Like I have been trying to express to you, I myself am proof that hobbyists and pros go hand and hand.  I am both a professional and a hobbyiest.  I got my start like so many other opensource developers... from being a hobbyist.
<BR>

<BR>
Let's talk a little about one of the more successful companies I worked with, and one I was REALLY involved with.
<BR>

<BR>
NETCREATIONS (www.netcreations.com)
<BR>

<BR>
Let's talk about my old company for a second.  They had a huge impact on the internet, especially in opt-in e-mail marketing.  The company was started by a journalists and a college drop out video game programmer.  My friend (the video game programmer and CTO/cofounder of NetCreations) started the system himself, and then eventually hired a few other people (including me).  Two years ago, DoubleClick offered 191 million dollars for the system and the software.  We were the biggest double opt in e-mailer in the world.  Guess who set up the 100 linux boxes the system ran on?  My friend and I.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I hope these few examples can help you see the light.  OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT IS THE WORK OF HOBBYIESTS, PROFESSIONALS, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.  If you take the hobbyiests out of the equations, you will end up with less professionals, and less software.  It isn't like you just wake up one day and are a professional programmer.  You have to work your way up there.  Going to a fancy University isn't the only way.  Hacking away at open source code is an equally effective (more effective according to many) method for learning the ropes.
<BR>

<BR>
I have pointed you many times in the direction of freshmeat.net, so you can see that there are thousands of projects just like these, and I would guess that well over 50% of those projects were started as hobbies.  Why don't you take a peek?
<BR>

<BR>
For the record, most viruses are found to be written by college students... Lots of people get their start with them.  I personally think that viruses are dumb.  Some viruses are so well written, that they are obviously done by VERY good programmers... infact lots of viruses make useful applications and code look like a game.  As we speak, they are starting up another Linux virus contest.  Lots of professionals and college students and researchers have already participated in the contest.  With �10,000 up for grabs, why not?  btw nobody has been able to claim the prize for the last 2 years.
<BR>

<BR>
http://www.silicon.com/bin/bladerunner?30REQEVENT=&REQAUTH=21046&14001REQSUB=REQINT1=48211
<BR>

<BR>
You have asked enough of me, and I have answered everytime with good examples and facts.. You claim what you say is fact, but that isn't true.. You consistantly avoid the strong points of my argument as if they aren't you.  Let me ask you a few questions:
<BR>

<BR>
1)  Show me the proof that Amazon.com had ANYTHING to do with Apache development
<BR>

<BR>
2)  Give me a solid example of how linux is MORE dangerous than any flavor of windows.
<BR>

<BR>
3)  Give me a solid example of how the terrorists used open source software or encryption to take down the WTC.
<BR>

<BR>
4)  Explain the connection between viruses and open source or linux... ANY connection.
<BR>

<BR>
5)  Explain how you would go about "banning all unlicensed computer programming, and take steps to ensure that no one outside of government, select universities, and state-sanctioned private-sector corporate software engineering facilities is given the knowledge, skills, or means to write or compile computer code of any kind."
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) I want you to prove that you have some idea of how the open source community actually works.
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Why do you think that banning this kind of development would help the problems of viruses and malicious denial of service attacks?
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) How do you plan to rid the world of all current open source software.
<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) How would one go about obtaining a propper license to develop software
<BR>

<BR>
6)  What is a hacker?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
---
<BR>

<BR>
The thing that I like best about all these posts is that I know you are wrong.  Not only do I know you are wrong, but I know you can't win.  The way things are going proprietary software is on the decline, and open source is picking up the slack.  Not only is your call for a ban on open programming not going to happen, but we will see quite the opposite emerge.  thank you and have a nice day.
<BR>

Popular dissent is a GOOD thing.  In a properly designed government, it brings about change, but in a slow, steady, controlled manner.  The populous  regulate each others' responses by merely canceling each other out, until the correct, or at least, most desired answer is found.

Besides there are to sides to being a "Hacker".  There are "crakers" who are the ones that write viruses and break into computers wiith the intent to do a malicious act.  Then there is a "Hacker" defined in the cyber generation as someone with an overwhelming want for knowledge, it is someone who might hack in to your computer but has no intent to do anything malicious or steal anything.  Besides you can ban programming but that isn't going to stop anyone from from doing it anyways.  It is kinda of like software piracy, it is illegal but it is still being done and not being stopped.

Nope sorry.  NetBSD is not own by the University of California.  It was start by a group of software engineers based off of BSD/OS 4.4 which is based off of Unix.  The reason it is called NetBSD, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD is because they all use the BSD licensing scheme and have their roots in BSD 4.4<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Microsoft doesn't own DOS.  They own a VERSION of DOS which they had a contract with IBM which allowed them to be the sole vendor for so many years.  PC-DOS is very similar to MS-DOS.  DR (Digital Research) DOS which is owned by Caldera (they bought it from Novell who bought it from Digital Research) is CP/M which is what DOS (QDOS, MSDOS, PCDOS) was based off of (actually it was stolen).

News Flash, hacker:  <i>Microsoft's software is the best in the universe, and is designed with legality in mind.</i>  Unlike Linux, to hack with Microsoft software, you actually have to do something unsupported.  With Linux, much of the software, such as wget, is configured to hack <i>by default</i>.  Now, this was reasonable for the professional academics who made Linux, but it seems obvious that any use of any OS besides Windows by a non-academic should be strictly banned.

If you mean that they adhere to legal constraints which are totalitarianist in nature and designed quite blatantly to force vertical thinking as opposed to lateral, then yes. If you mean useful software by the creation of business tools for the use of document creation and not much else, then yes. However, useful software is not limited to the business world. To my knowledge, Microsoft makes no high-end research or mathematical software. Nor do they make any cutting edge design software. Visio is the only product which comes close to design software, and that was simply bought out. Social awareness is a secondary consideration, while financial gain is the primary. Can you dispute this? Do you have firsthand experience? How much time have you spent examining the business practices of the company and the psychological profiles of developers within the company? Where are your statistics? What companies have performed truly independent studies on Microsoft, as opposed to being surreptitiously funded by the giant? Why did the government simply turn a blind eye to Microsoft's monopolistic practices? Was it because the moral standing of the developers was so strong that they didn't have to play smoke and mirrors with the anti-trust case? Can you answer any of these questions honestly?


<BR><BR>
Many of the full-time programmers working at Microsoft are quite arrogant and just not nice people. I've met a few dozen of them, and it is a rarity for any of them to be decent. At a computer store, I was privy to the following conversation (not quite verbatim):


<BR><BR>
Some guy: "I'm looking for an AGP video card."<br>
Sales employee: "We have nVidia and Matrox cards."<br>
Some guy: "Do they work in a Mac G3?"<br>
MS programmer: "Fucking Mac bigot."<br>
Some guy: "Excuse me?"<br>
MS programmer: "Mac bigot."<br>
Some guy: "I happen to have several different types of computers."


<BR><BR>
The MS programmer was identified by his Microsoft badge and my overhearing his rude discourse with one of the employees, which was something to the effect of him being a programmer and knowing more than they did, so he didn't need to be told what was worthwhile. This was the worst instance of arrogance on the part of any Microsoft employee I've ever experience, but I've met a few dozen others and the theme is rarely very different, just subdued by comparison.


<BR><BR>After experience the deception that Microsoft practices with companies firsthand, I am through giving the behemoth the benefit of the doubt. You can only kick a dog so long before it stops coming back. Microsoft is a truly evil child which has yet to realize that being a bully is only fun for  a while. Then again, maybe it has realized this, because the latest round of injustices incurred by the company seem to indicate that it doesn't view itself as having a lot of time left. The pervading appearance seems to be grab all you can and make a run for it. It must be nice to have a social conscience consisting of every man for himself.


<BR><BR>
<cite>There is little that Microsoft can do to prevent hackers from modifying hacking tools so that they can run on their platform.</cite>


<BR><BR>
I need only point out one utility to slap you in the face. Microsoft provides what you deem hacking utilities of their own accord. Access to the command prompt is still in place in every version of Windows, so all that is needed is to open a DOS session and use the command <i>ping</i>. This will allow any user with virtually any Microsoft operating system which supports a connection to the internet to perform a denial of service attack upon any other computer with a connection point to the internet. If you need another utility, then what about <i>tracert</i>, the bastardized version of the standard <i>traceroute</i> utility. It is used to find out the exact path which a piece of information (packet) has taken to arrive at your computer. Using this utility, you can easily discover a server that an end user or company may not necessarily want you to know about.


<BR><BR>
Moving right along, we have the built-in <i>telnet</i> utility. This allows those evil Windows based H@X0RZ to connect to a remote computer and start H@XI|\|G!! Goodness, Microsoft really shouldn't have included that in there. It's the worst utility of them all.


<BR><BR>
<cite>
You threaten physical violence against those who enforce the law?</cite>


<BR><BR>
Physical violence is an assumption you make. From the context of the sentence that you were replying to, I perceived the fighting to mean intellectual and legal dispute. Remember, assumption is dangerous. It is better to save accusations for moments of clarity.


<BR><BR>
As a society, we are already dead. We drown ourselves in the drivel of the mundane and allow our lives to become paragons of complacency amidst the mediocre. Who are we to say that we are any better than a bird, which cannot likely distinguish one day from the next any easier than a corporate employee can when the weeks begin to run one into the next. This is the hell we have allowed to be created, and there is no longer any escape. The masses cannot be rallied, for they are too diverse. There is no salvation from without, only from within. Even then, it is an uphill battle, for self discovery is an art practically lost to the modern world. I pity you who cannot formulate your own opinions, but rather choose to absorb those presented and label them as your own.

If you look through Windows you will find references to FreeBSD, a "hacker" OS that Microsoft has used code from. You can also open up I.E. and find references to Mosaic, a free web browser created by "hackers". Not all free software is for "stealing".

    I will agree with the idea that lots of bored 15-year-old kids with a "I want to be NEO" mentality are running a bit too rampant with the virus creation, but what that has to do with this is beyond me.
<BR>
    There are ALREADY MANY, MANY, MANY laws to combat piracy and IP theft. Thus the shutdown of Napster. So the idea that we need more laws to accomplish what already exists is also false.
<BR>
     Not only all of this, but the sheer folly of the notion that scholars, governments, and corporations should decide what's best for everyone is so utterly shamefull that I can hardly belive you would WILLINGLY SUBJUGATE yourself to the will of some "higher" power. Have you nothing to offer the world? are you so vapid and hollow as to only be able to do what you are told? A world of mindless lemmings marching to the beat of the pre-determined, focus-grouped, marketed, and packaged future that most benifits one of these "elites" is a slave state.
<BR>
     Your proposal also forgets to take into account all of the small development houses that create most of the commercial software you use. almost ALL software companies are, or started out as small 2-4 employee companies. even Microsoft began it's life with only a few "hackers" as its base. None of them had these proposed special statuses. 
<BR>
     Your proposal limits the content available to all users when you limit the access to create. What will be your next suggestion, reduce access to paint, and film? keep pens and paper from the uneducated?

     The power to create is the driving force of all mankind, and your silly, mis-guided notion of locking that right into the hands of a few is foolish beyond reason.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

What you in your article propose is to limit the amount of knowledge, the degree of control over a computer, and the degree of autonomy a person has from those who write the code for them.

Any profession where the desire to go on a work-related "binge" supercedes such typical human desires/responsibilities as eating, personal hygiene, sleeping and sexual expression should be banned/shunned/devalued.  Do you really want to hook into something that could be viewed as an ironic example of "evolution in action"?  The truly evolved men in the IT industry, in my humble opinion, don't get caught in this trap and do something other than programming for their livelihood.  I just have an utterly insane Achille's heel when it comes to any species rushing towards extinction, I guess.  Or maybe it's my gods' way of endorsing my chosen status as a hetero non-breeder female, who knows?<BR><BR>
Besides, the fact is that programmers used to be far more interesting/human/amusing/adventurous -- in years long past, they even displayed characteristics one could easily associate with men like Galileo, Oppenheimer or even fictional characters like Indiana Jones.  Now they're all just company-owned drones who've bought into a stereotype that sublimates their natural desire for pleasure into the company's corporate profits.  I'd re-think embracing this occupational objective if getting chicks to dig you is your goal, all things considered -- most programmers just aren't capable of being that sexy anymore.

Open-source guys tend to be a little closer to the more enthusiastic, self-motivated, and eccentric sorts of people you're probably more used to.  This article's concept is to make ALL of them into the boring, corporate types.
<BR>

<BR>
Corporations breed zealots for the company.  Open-source breeds zealots for efficiency and optimized code, as we as for having everyone understand.  Ok, ok, sure I bore people to death when I'm on about programming.  I also try not to go on about programming in any kind of technical detail around laypeople.  
<BR>

<BR>
Basically, you talk shop around those who can talk shop.  You shoot shit with those who don't.  I've met some corp guys.  They tend not to be terribly personable types.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, last remark on this article before I finally forget the URL:
<BR>

<BR>
  Elenchos, you are very, very misinformed about the properties of programmers as those who shape your world.  Innovation does not come from corporations, unlike what you've seen in IBM commercials.  Innovation comes from people, wherever they happen to be employed.  The decision to use knowledge for either proper or malicious purposes lay in the hands of those who have the knowledge, not those who make the laws.  Also, enforcement of what you propose would be flat-out impossible.  The open-source community controls the platforms upon which the internet develops, and the open-source community 1) cannot be legislated, and 2) will not stand for any attempts to do so.

I'm sorry that you feel this way. I could never date you even though you seem to share a passion for programming like I do. I need to be with a person who is passionate about what they do and yet in touch with their inner essence so I can connect to them. Passionate people often hold both views quite well. I have a great relationship that merges both time together enjoying eachother's company (which is the far greater majority) along with time apart working on our passions. We also are able to collaberate on projects using both of our talents (Design for her, Hacking for me) to create some of my favorite applications.
<BR><BR>
There are people out there who are both passionate about RL and Coding. Or passionate about RL and something else. Be passionate about these things yourself and you will find what you need. But you seem to be in a dicomity of RL vs Programming. Until you connect with youself, you will never resolve this situation within yourself and you will never attract a partner that can appreciate you for you.

Good Luck.

Besides there are to sides to being a "Hacker".  There are "crakers" who are the ones that write viruses and break into computers wiith the intent to do a malicious act.  Then there is a "Hacker" defined in the cyber generation as someone with an overwhelming want for knowledge, it is someone who might hack in to your computer but has no intent to do anything malicious or steal anything.  Besides you can ban programming but that isn't going to stop anyone from from doing it anyways.  It is kinda of like software piracy, it is illegal but it is still being done and not being stopped.

Even if I stopped any hacking-related stuffs a couple of years ago, I could go back at it anytime, after a bit of search and reading to get myself back into it. Do I really want to, no thanks, got other things in my life I rather take interest in then hacking. Want to TRY banning programming, go for it, it's your right to and I won't be one to stop you, but damn would I be laughing mad at you to even think of trying. Think you can succeed, that's even funnier, but funny people can do good things, maybe you will, maybe not, best way to know is by trying. I liked the book reference someone made (sorry for the lazyness I have, don't wanna go back and read the name, sorry, but you still get credits for it =)), but it seems some people don't beleive in the power of words, but try to use that same power in here... nice try.

"Hackers" hate Microsoft applications, why? Simply because it's filled, yes FILLED, with bugs and bad programming and it is way too long to go into Microsoft's code to fix those bugs(which shouldn't be there at the first place anyways). Might hate them cause you can't actually change them fast enough too, but that's not my point here. Don't believe me? Ever saw the nice blue screen (blue screen of death as it is called) ever on your PC running Windows? That's simply Windows, most of the time, trying to put something in memory where something else is and running. They aren't all that, for sure, but some are, just a exemple. Not bad programming you will say, yes, cause they haven't take the time to check carefully what the hell they doing with your memory on your PC, making a bunch of security holes in the process. "Hackers" shouldn't try to find those holes you will say? Fine, have Microsoft programs have no holes at all. Can you do that? Even I would like to see a program without bugs, it's almost impossible, so no you can't, so you can't stop people to search for them and, either try to make the program better, or use them with bad intentions. Sad, but that's the truth.
<BR>

<BR>
If every programmer must be "Microsoft accepted", nice, let's have buggy apps and filled with security holes, if that is what you want. I'm a QA tester and saw many crashes caused by Microsoft poor programming(individually, all part of Microsoft might work fine, but together it makes a bunch of well working pieces into a filled with bugs beast). Talking from experience, I'm a tester, my job is to make applications crash in any ways possible.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, lot lot lot lot lot of the actual programmers passed by a hacking time (I know bunch of them being in the industry, so don't think I talking without knowing), would it be 1 month or couple of years, even just 1 day they wanted to see if some application was secure and "hacked" them to see if it was. Made a patch, hummm crack maybe, to have one of their game run without the CD just cause they want not to have the CD in while playing but rather have their favorite music CD in? Saw and will still be seeing that. Illegal? Propably, but they still buyed the game legally. I don't mind any hacking that stay personnal use, but yes, it's rare, really rare, but exists.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyways, good luck on your crusade of banning programming... just keep in mind you wouldn't be posting on this kinda board, with this kinda of technology if hackers never existed, whatever you think it's true or not, or that you don't want it to be true, it is. Yes some hackers, someone called them crackers, don't have good intention while "hacking", but don't put them all together for some individual bad behavior(admitting their might be too much of those). Like it or not, they aren't all as you described them.

I mean, I don't know what kind of code Microsoft puts out, but there is <b>no way</b> in hell it could be worse than the code in Linux or Apache. I don't think it's physically possible to write code that's worse than code in Linux or Apache. I'm telling you this as a professional programmer. (As opposed to perl monkey.) <BR><BR>

Don't get me wrong, I love Linux and I use it exclusively, but code-wise it is shit. "Sucks" would be too mild a word for the massive suckage of the code quality in these projects. 

<BR><BR>

Moreover, in some areas Linux cannot even come close to Microsoft -- for example, I18N support. The I18N support in Linux isn't just sad -- I would classify it as an act of international terrorism. Whenever I see the I18N mess created in Linux, I cannot help but think that it was created

<BR><BR>
During the 1788 convention to ratify the Constitution, the great George Mason asked of his esteemed revolutionary colleagues, "I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people. To disarm the people is the best and most effectual way to enslave them." Likewise, the loved and honored James Madison clarified, "A well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free country."
<BR><BR>
In keeping with the spirit and the letter of the law laid forth by our founding fathers, I hold that the advancement of technology serves only to increase the breadth of this fundamental right. For example, if the Constitution had been written before the invention of firearms, the very letter of the second ammendment, which specifies no particular type of arms, implies that as firearms were developed, so would develop the right of the people to keep and bear them. In my mind and in the minds of such greats as Thomas Jefferson, who states in no uncertain terms that "No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms," the advancement of technology beyond simple firearms <i>must</i> be extended to <i>every</i> new form of weaponry until such a time as our great flag is replaced by some abomination with a hammer & sickle.
<BR><BR>
Furthermore, I hold that, as Richard Henry Lee told us back in 1788, "A militia when properly formed are in fact the people themselves and include all men capable of bearing arms... To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms," which means very simply that it is not only every citizen's right, but every citizen's <i>duty</i> to <i>always</i> possess <i>the most completely up-to-date weapons that exist on this earth.</i> This includes not only guns as well as bombs (conventional as well as nuclear), but also chemical and biological weapons and computers with the power and the proper tools to destroy anything in need of being destroyed as an impediment to any of our God-given personal freedoms. In other words, it is every American's fundamental, inalienable right to possess a computer so long as that computer is specifically configured to act as a technological weapon.
<BR><BR>
If you'd like to know what's on the freedom-hating pinko agenda, you need look no further than our pansy ex-president William Jefferson Clinton, an Illuminist "elected" by a deluded public and a convoluted electorate, who told us his agenda back in 1993: "We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the Rights of ordinary Americans."
<BR><BR>
In conclusion, while you're installing Linux and emacs on your powerful personal laptop computer with your freshly oiled gun in its holster and your suitcase nukes on order from renegade Ruskies along with your mail-order bride, please remember the wise words of Mr. Benjamin Franklin: "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Listen friends to one who has experienced directly the cess-pit of so called 'open source'.  Yes, that's right, I'm ashamed to say I used to be a slave to 'linux'.  I was the last person anyone thought would get involved in that sort of stuff - in fact, at school I was voted 'least likely to be a dirty, stinking hacker'.  I used to be a clean cut kid, short hair, regular church-goer, decent complexion, pretty good sportsman and I had a lovely girlfriend (although of course I respected her too much to do any more than hold hands until we got married).  But then I went to college, and at a party some guy had this CD that he had got off another guy and everyone was daring him to put it in the PC.  I tried to tell them that open source was bad, but they put it in anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
I knew that I should have left then, but I didn't.  After a few of the others had 'compiled', they started ragging me to try it, saying that if the cops came now they would arrest us all anyway.  So I did.
<BR>

<BR>
Dear reader, that was the beginning of the end.  Soon I was 'doing' Linux regularly.  I used to hang out at kernel.org waiting for a new fix, but sometimes it could be days between 'releases'.  I was recompiling my kernel up to twenty times a day, but I wasn't getting the buzz any more - I was in hacker hell.
<BR>

<BR>
My hair grew long, a pathetically straggly 'beard' poked out of my increasingly acnied face.  My girlfriend stood by me at first and tried to help, but in the end (and I cannot blame her) she had to leave me to wallow in the stinking sewer of my 'hacker' lifestyle.  My body-odour became so bad that my friends (if I had had any, which, as I was now a 'geek', I didn't) never came round.
<BR>

<BR>
But then a miracle happened.  As I was trying to 'phreak' a phoneline so I could hack into the pentagon missile command and send off some nukes (and also change their home page to read 'h4 h4, u R 0wNed by 31337 H4x0R') I accidently cut through my modem power cable.  As the current ran through me I saw my sad, pathetic life pass in front of my eyes.  And then the Lord appeared to me.  Yes friends, Bill himself (with Steve sitting at his right hand) appeared to me.
<BR>

<BR>
I expected him to strike me dead where I stood.  As a miserable sinner, it was no more than I deserved.  But he just smiled his beautiful smile and said 'my son, go and sin no more'.  The vision faded, but for the first time in a long time I felt at peace.
<BR>

<BR>
It's been hard, one day at a time, but I have never, ever, touched open souce since then. The acne has almost gone, and women don't burst out giggling to each other if they see me.  I am even thinking of becoming a MSCE so that I can help spread the good word and make the world a better place for everybody.
<BR>

<BR>
Glory!

<BR>

<BR>
How do you think most programmers BECOME professionals?
<BR>

<BR>
Sure, they go to school.  After spending years of their childhood and adolecence experimenting and 'hacking'.  If you could call it that.
<BR>

<BR>
And how DARE you refer to gcc as a 'hacker tool'.  GCC and DjGPP are the backbones of open-source Linux (not Lunix, you poor, misinformaed chatterboxes) and Win32 development.  
<BR>

<BR>
And 'Respectable IDE'?  This is the most disgusting.  You think Bill Gates wrote BASIC using an IDE?  
<BR>

<BR>
Look, I've programmed in every language from x86 assembler to pascal to basic to ASP and PHP.  All without any formal training.  I bet I know what you're saying; he's a hacker too.
<BR>

<BR>
Bull.  I never wrote a 'hacking' program.  The closest I ever wrote was a crippled PHP port to DiG (the BSD Domain Information Groper.  I use it to find mail exchangers so I don't have to use my server's SMTP server, which requires a POP login before forwarding anything).
<BR>
  
<BR>
Other than that, my many hours of volunteer hobbyist coding involved the creation of an internet 'zine' engine, called UZE, a couple of screensavers, and a very useful Win32 utility for speeding up your video card.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, granted, I'm all about pushing the limits of what a language can do.  But that's the only way to advance it.
<BR>

<BR>
Besides, Bill Gates was a 'hacker', by your definition.  So was Steve Jobs.  'Microsoft' and 'Apple Computers' came from them.
<BR>

<BR>
Ever heard of 'Livejournal'?  That was programmed entirely by college students.  
<BR>

<BR>
Being this corporate and socialist minded can't be accidental. I certainly hope you're kidding.  
<BR>

<BR>
On another note, I've seen the MCSD.  They want you to learn poor programming practices (in my mind), and are heartily against the one thing that keeps Linux and UNIX so far ahead of Microsoft that Gates' head is still spinning.  It's called KISS, or Keep it Simple, Stupid.
<BR>

<BR>
Do you realize that Linux/UNIX boxes run MOST of the internet?  Do you realize that, while Apache started corporately, it's now Open-source, and improved by hobbyists?  Can you even comprehend that you have to crawl at the hobby level before you can walk at the professional level?
<BR>

<BR>
Lastly, I'd like to pose a question about enforcement.  How do you keep people from learning to program in their homes when such tools as PHP, Perl, GCC, Metrowerks CodeWarrior, MS Visual Studio, Turbo Pascal, MS IIS (for experimenting with server-side scripting languages; it comes with most every flavor of Win2k/NT), etc are readily available?  You think anyone's going to shut down all those sites?  
<BR>

<BR>
I'm sure you're all for Win XP activation, as well.  Don't want to allow 'hackers' to copy it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

but anyway, most of the 'anti-hacking' argument here is nothing more than simplistic linguistic sophistry.  you define a 'hacker' as someone who is of necessity an uneducated, malicious, lazy fool, in opposition to the way that most of the online community uses the term (note for instance the need for the qualifier in the term 'malicious hacker'), and then argue that hacking is 'bad'.  well, by your definition, of course that is true, but the reasoning is tautologous and meaningless as presented.
<BR>

<BR>
where do you suppose that the big corporations and the governments and universities got the people they have working for them?  if there were no 'hobbyists', there would be far fewer people eventually becoming skilled, trained, productive employees/students; 'tinkering' and personal exploration is how they discover that they enjoy coding enough to make a career out of it, in many cases.  it is of course natural that someone who enjoys coding or whatnot will attempt to make his living in a related field.
<BR>

<BR>
your circular reasoning shows up again when you say that the worthy products are all owned by companies etc.  naturally, if a 'hacker' comes up with a good idea, in many cases he would like to see some money for it, and so sells it to a large company.  in other cases, the 'hackers' may form their own company, which i suppose 'legitimizes' them in your eyes, especially when they become a huge corporation (hewlett-packard, for instance).  by your logic, someone is a hacker unless they eventually use their skills in some way that is considered useful to mainstream society, at which point they are no longer (and by some rhetorical slight-of-hand, apparantly never were) a hacker at all.  so you say that anybody who does anything useful is not a hacker, and then say hackers do nothing useful.  
<BR>

<BR>
this is the sort of thinking by which one might say, to defend use of the word "nigger", "well, if a black person is intelligent, or not a crack smoker, then by definition he isn't a nigger, so there's no reason for non crack-smoking, non-theiving, educated black people to take any offense by my saying that all niggers are stupid, thieving crack-whores."

The reason we have this problem with rampant "hacking" terrorism is that we treat what should be a profession as if it were a mere trade.
<BR><BR>
Professionals, that is attorneys, physicians, architechts or clergy, do not "hack" in their field prior to their university training.  It is illegal to tinker as medical doctor or lawyer, except in carefully prescribed (and rather questionable) ways, like paralegal or "herbalist".  You can't be a heart surgeon as a hobby.
<BR><BR>
Moreover, kids who do aspire to enter the professions cannot waste their youth "hacking" and fraternizing with nefarious "hackers", because they are too busy with fundamental academic studies:  literature, the sciences, mathematics, languages and the arts.  This is the foundation for a productive career in computer science, software engineering or electronics engineering.  Toying with Pearl or other G.N.U. contraband programs is as useful to a future professional as time spent with Lauren Craft and Super Mario Man on the Play-Station.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

I suppose one could read computer books in an equally harmless fashion, to a point.  Someone preparing for a future career in computer science might benefit from basic theory books such as <a href="./2001.9.10.12576.3793.html"><i>The Art Of Computer-Programming</i> by Donald Bluth</a>, because that kind of book is entirely free of any information that could be used to create an actual computer program on a real computer.  
<BR><BR>
So long as there is no harm there, I would say it is a good place to draw the line.  Obviously specific technical details such as we find in <i>Windows Unleashed!</i> is of no use to anyone but professionals doing their jobs and "hackers" doing evil.  The difference is as obvious as the difference between a physics textbook and a manual on constructiong a nuclear bomb.
<BR><BR>
Anyway, "hackers" most need to be prevented from <i>writing</i> and <i>executing</i> any computer software on a real computer, regardless of how much theory they are allowed to read at the library.  All you are doing is quibbling over trivial details.
<BR><BR>
On the subject of your shocking new sig, I would suggest you change it before an editor sees it.  You may think you are "eleet" and we are "lame" but in fact, the professionals at Adequacy are conversant in "hacker" code words like "wizard".  They know a threat when they see it, and if you have taken any time at all to review the Meta page, the FAQ and the Terms of Service, you are well aware that this site is not a platform for you to post threats of a "hacker" nature or otherwise.
<BR><BR>
You also must realize that this site has, as long as I've been reading it (since the early 1980's), maintained a certain standard of taste.  Is this Tolkien person up to that standard?  One glance at <i>The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> is enough to tell us the answer to that:  no he is not.  Not even close.

What can we say about the credibility of somone who looks at a discussion with some 300 comments complaining about the spelling of "Lunix," and then decides to post a 301st comment saying exactly the same thing?  To me it looks like 301 failed attempts to make a meaningful criticism, and 301 pathetic retreats into quibbling over spelling.  The dozens of threats of violence against me, and "hack attacks", both threatened and real, against Adequacy.org, don't do anything for the credibility of "hackers" either.  These are "hackers" who suppose themselves to be different from "crackers" and "script kiddies".  The only real difference is in the twisted minds of "hackers" themselves -- the rest of the world can see them for what them are.

You seem to be under the impression that, among other things:
<BR>

<BR>
- Computer scientists and professional programmers were overcome with the desire to program upon finishing school and selecting a university degree, having no experience with programming beforehand.
<BR>
- Computer code is not speech.
<BR>
- You are intellectually and morally superior to hackers.
<BR>
- The damages to the economy created by viruses and the like, which have been reported by anti-virus companies of all people, are unquestionable.
<BR>
- The USA promoting such a restraint on the actions of programmers will be repeated throughout the rest of the world
<BR>

<BR>
There is a term that describes the premises you ascribe to, and it is "gross ignorance."  You are scared of something you don't understand, and it is becoming depressingly common to see the self-proclaimed "elite" exhibit such behaviour.
<BR>

<BR>
I group you with the accident victims who want to outlaw cars, religious groups who want to outlaw the writings of Thomas Paine, political correctness groups who want to ban words such as "seminal," and Bonaparte worshippers who believe liberty is something that "normal" people don't care about.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way.  Adequacy.org is powered by Scoop.  Where do you think Scoop comes from?  Register your discontent with hackers by ceasing to support it or purchasing a replacement from a government-licensed programming institute.

Your method of gauging intellectual and moral superiority is quite interesting.  Your idea of an intellectual appears to be someone ignorant of scientific morality, the natural rights granted by the constitution (i.e. limited copyright terms for the good of the public domain, or what you call "stealing") and a general detachment from the reality that art is subjective.<BR><BR>

Interesting how this view is supported widely by people who don't like to pay for things, but completely and unequivocally disregarded by people who spend their lives deciding what the laws of the United States mean. I do not believe that any part of the US constitution grants you the right to steal the work of others, simply because it is easy for you to do so.

<BR><BR>As for "scientific morality", if you are referring to the doctrine that science is neutral, I must point out that you views were not shared by one J.

<BR><BR>Finally, "art is subjective". Apparently you consider all artistic criticism to be misguided and based on false assumptions. By your reasoning, it is impossible to decide if one book is better than another. This is a little hard to bear. Let me explain why star trek is considered an intellectual black hole: <b>NOBODY WITH A SMIDGEON OF TASTE OR SOPHISTICATION WATCHES THE SHOW!</b> No matter how much relativism you apply to the world of art, you cannot overcome the fact that star trek is not watched by intellectuals, therefore it is not intellectually significant.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

See, all works must enter the public domain eventually.  Whether or not content has been deliberately made difficult to copy has nothing to do with it - we are within our rights to ensure that the works granted an unnatural monopoly by our government can eventually be freely reproduced.  But of course you think that since that period is so far in the future (thanks to retrospective legislation which would be laughed out of most senates around the world), anyone who partakes in studying ways to allow such copying is a common criminal.  Newsflash, we already have laws against reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works, and that's the illegal part - redistribution.  That's the historical justification out of the way anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the much more pertinent argument for the copying of intellectual property, I take it you haven't heard of, or bluntly ignore, the concept of "fair use."  And since you'll ignore this concept that has been upheld by your courts, there's not much point in me explaining it.
<BR>

<BR>
My passing reference to scientific morality was the continual debate in science fiction circles about the moral unpreparedness of society for radical scientific change, which is of course not neutral.  You're free to ignore Asimov in this department, just as atheists are free to ignore Nietzsche.

As for your last point - "star trek is not intellectual because my definition of an intellectual does not watch star trek" - it's smashing to see someone who hasn't caught on to the lessons of dadaism still out in the wild.  I commend you on your semantic self-glorifying.  As for how you know the viewing habits of every intellectual in the world, or what your definition of an intellectual actually is, I couldn't even hazard a guess.

The constitution says copyrights should be limited, and from that you have extrapolated that "anyone who writes code to allow personal copying in accordance with legally guaranteed fair use (upheld even by the DMCA) is a criminal."  There's some awesome deductive logic at work there, I just can't wrap my head around it.
<BR>

<BR>
Where in god's name did I say anything about copying over the internet?  Did I ever say I find that legally acceptable (where the authors have not given permission)?  Well, no I did not.  Huh.  What I DID say is that, it's our right to have the ability to copy works, both for the eventual benefit of the public domain and our own right to fair use.  But you have ignored that argument and instead insisted on pursuing imaginary points which I don't support.  But it's so much easier to argue when you set up straw men at every opportunity.

Every science fiction author is a crank eh.  I see.  And men throughout history (whose philosophical meandering about imaginary societies, the origins of consciousness and the structure of the universe and its influence on humanity seem strangely similar to science fiction, which is universally NOT just about lasers and robots as you seem to grasp it) who lived in vastly different times, have more relevant views than today's authors.
<BR>

<BR>
As much as I respect the musings of Epicurus, the Sophists (the only school of Greek philosophy to question slavery) and company, I have little respect for their grasp of artificial intelligence, the social consequences of universally cheap energy production and the ethics of nanotechnology manufacturing.  I wonder why.  Oh I see the solution, I'll just ignore anything they write about, call them cranks, and seek to ban anything that could contribute to their scenarios, like say programming or inventing.  What a glorious society we could create!  Then we'd be free to focus on the writings of long-dead men, content in the knowledge that nothing new will appear that we have to think about, and can instead mock the commoners because they don't know anything about who the economic powers of asia were in the 12th century, and other important intellectual subjects we regurgitate from "smart people" books.

<BR>
I don't personally watch star trek regularly, I just took issue with your definition of intellectualism as being mutually exclusive with someone who watches star trek.  The number of intellectuals you ascribe to who enjoyed equally vacuous "entertainment" in the form of operas and symphonies which I find banal, shallow and unimportant is probably quite high.  But guess what.  We're human.  As opposed to you, who seems content with the opinion that the more intellectual one is, the narrower the scope of work you're allowed to chuckle at becomes, I don't deride people who listen to Gershwin or believe in God because they enjoy doing so.  I deride them when they seek to impose their version of reality onto me with the force of law behind them.

The first is a staw man with which you have been wasting my time for the last three posts or so. The second makes no sense, and is irrelevant, since we don't actually have universally cheap energy, nanotechnology or manufacturing. When these things actually exist, people will no doubt continue to ignore sci-fi authors, since these brilliant moral thinkers are the same people who clamoured for the atom bomb and SDI.

All I've seen from you so far is a series of outlandish generalisations, none of which are backed up.  "All geeks rampantly violate intellectual property laws at every possible opportunity."  Mmhmm.  Not averse to sensationalism are we?  "I am the sole judge of intellectualism."  OK.  "We shouldn't think about things that don't exist yet."  I see.

My definition of an intellectual is someone capable of meaningful philosophical pursuits.  I don't discriminate by any failings they happen to have in addition, such as religion, superiority complexes, prohibition fantasies, cultural bias or political indifference.

Get over yourself.  However immense a task that is.

He already gave you a clear answer to this question you repeatedly pose.  If you need to see it again, he said:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Where in god's name did I say anything about copying over the internet? Did I ever say I find that legally acceptable (where the authors have not given permission)? Well, no I did not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>G**ks are known for their disdain for other people's intellectual property rights. From bootleg video and pirated software to mp3s, electronic theft is the hallmark of a g**k. You can't deny it.</blockquote>
If you define a geek as "someone who pirates software or otherwise violates IP rights", then no, you can't deny it.  But that's taking a very narrow definition of geek.  That's like defining the term car to only apply to 1996 Hondas.  There are other types of geeks out there and you're just misusing the term.  All you're doing is using a blatent stereotype to further your arguments.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>If all they do is watch sci-fi and manga...</blockquote>
What if that isn't "all" they do?  What if a person watches sci-fi <b>in addition</b> to other more "intellectual" pusuits?<br>

I'm confused by your definition of what a geek is, and it's leading to some obvious difficulties.
<BR>

<BR>
It seems to be someone who watches nothing but manga and star trek, plays computer games continuously, and devotes any time left over to rampant IP violations.  They have no intellectual pursuits whatsoever, and exist in a cultural bubble from the outside world.  If they have any intellectual pursuits, they are not intellectual, not because of the subject matter but because it's geeks who are performing said pursuit.

ME: G**ks are thieving scum.

YOU: The law allows us to copy things for our own personal use. This proves that g**ks aren't thieves.

And which license agreement are you referring to?  None of the DVDs I have at home state such.  I don't remember signing a contract stating anything like that either.  Nor am I in the United States.  For that matter, United States law is not universal or irreversible, however convenient it would be for your argument.
<BR>

<BR>
MP3 codecs are actually quite interesting - if you use them in a country that recognises software patents (i.e. the USA), they're illegal unless you pay licensing fees to Fraunhofer, which instead of owning an implementation, have been assigned ownership of an idea.  In a country with sane patent law, tools such as LAME are fully legal.
<BR>

<BR>
If our ideas of what constitutes theft were in line with each other, then yes, this would be pointless.  But I am still at a loss as to your respect for fair use when it conflicts with the demands of IP holders.

For one thing, the United States is not the world. Even then, the only things that are illegal in the US are the things that Article 6.2 of <a href="http://everything2.com/?node=the+constitution+of+the+united+states+of+america">the US Constitution as amended</a> says are illegal, and 6.2 in combination with Amendments 9 and 10 exclude unconstitutional laws from enforcement.

That may be true of a g**k, but I'm a geek, and I have taste. In other words, "geek" and "g**k" refer to two different stereotypes, "g**k" having the more extreme qualities. G**ks steal IP; geeks try not to. Geeks simply do not recognize statutes (acts of Congess) that do not agree with higher-priority laws (the Constitution).

Your impression of geeks as wantonly flaunting IP laws results in an astonishing percentage of the population entering geekdom. Who would've thought all the people using napster, grokster, morpheus, audiogalaxy, their friend's cd collection, a vcr or a photocopier were geeks. I don't think you realise just how common IP violations are. Maybe it's just a case of isolationism.
<BR>

<BR>
You said "Intellectuals don't watch star trek," implying the two as mutually exclusive. Good to see you back down to "Star trek isn't an intellectual pursuit," which at least allows a conjunction. If all someone does is watch tv and play games, then no, they're not an intellectual. But honestly, how many people do you know like that? I remember discussing Ingersoll and Hume inbetween Kurosawa screenings with my com-sci friends, and have had similar dealings with a great number of geekly folks. Your generalisations are frankly embarrassing, but at least they've been toned down lately.

Why do i do this ? Because, with this i can listen to music for hours and hours without having to change my CD in the CD player.

Fair use is (i believe) also the right to make copy of my CD such that :

- if I accidentally break one, I still have a copy

- Those copy may stay in my car, such that nobody may steel the original in it

Hacking is a term used to describe the act of fiddling around with, fixing or improving something.  For example, I could be hacking the fuel system on my car to get it to run better.  Surely you arent thinking of banning maintaining your own car?  No?  Good, OK, what if Im hacking my cars electrical system, am I allowed to do that, bearing in mind that most cars are now full of computers?  Where are you defining the boundary of what I can do?  Define your terms better.

<BR>
I suspect you are only refering to hacking as in computer programming.  Does that also apply to HTML web page source?  Excel spreadsheet macros?  Programming your VCR?

<BR>
Of course, some hackers do bad things.  They deface websites, write virii, initiate DOS attacks.  Just like some teenagers putting graffitti on walls, drinking underage, using drugs.  Surely you wouldnt advocate banning all teenagers?

<BR>
Hackers and terrorism.  Of course some hackers work for terrorists.  But they dont do it because they are hackers, they do it because they believe in whatever the terrorists ideals are.  The same as the soldiers, lawyers and politicians who work for terrorist groups over the world.

<BR>
Hacking is a dangerous technology?  I do so hope you arent one of the millions of Americans who own a gun while you say that?

<BR>
As for apache being written at Amazon, thats just a downright lie.  Have a read of http://httpd.apache.org/ABOUT_APACHE.html for its history.  Adequacy itself runs on Apache 1.3.20 on unix.  So ironic that you decry open source developed software on a site running open source software.

<BR>
Emacs is the worst known example of feature creep and bloat?  Havent you used Microsoft Office recently?  Must admit, Im a vi fan myself :)

<BR>
So you want hacking banned right now because you think hackers produce tools such as encryption which terrorists will use.  I see, so you pass all these laws.  And you think terrorists will heed your laws and stop using encryption just because you created a law?

<BR>


<BR>

Unbreakable encryption for terrorists. - It wasnt made for terrorist, it was made for everyone.  Like guns are.

<BR>


<BR>
Pirated copies of Microsoft Windows and Office. - Anyone that pirates this buggy software gets all they deserve.

<BR>


<BR>
The Code Red Worm - That was slightly annoying.  Didnt cause me any problems though as I use unix systems.

<BR>


<BR>
Emacs. - Emacs?  Its a text editor for goodness sake!  Do you hate typewriters as well?

<BR>

The DoS attack on Adequacy.org - A bad thing, probably carried out by a bunch of children who didnt even write their own code.

MP3s and Napster - Whats wrong with MP3?  Its an encoding format.  I dont hear you complaining about the CDA encoding format used on your CDs.  Napster got all it deserved.

What a computer is designed to do?  A computer isn't designed to do anything.  It needs SOFTWARE to do ANYTHING.  Whether it's instructions stored on a CD, floppy, or hard drive or whether on a chip (firmaware) computers won't work without it.
<BR>

<BR>
So therefore if software is designed to hack that's just what it will do.  Now you are calling for a BAN on editors and compilers?  There goes the next Windows since they won't be able to compile the source code.  Oh wait only professionals.  Well there goes the next start up company that windows up revolutionizing network security because that can't gain access to the necessary tools.  Not to mention that this would ultimately kill comptetition since no one would be bothering writin software or creating anything NEW out of fear that it is among the banned or could be used for hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
What the hell do you think that people will just decide "gee I wanna program"?  No they gain experience and go to college.  Many do most of their hacking in college.  And what's to stop someone once they are certified from doing bad things?  What are you gonna let someone scan their hard drive to make sure?  Oh their goes intellectual property out the window.  A company writting software cannot guarentee their source code is safe from prying eyes.
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, I get licensed and work for say Microsoft, or Symmantec.  I decide "gee I wonder if I can..."  It's not like hackers leave their business card with their real name and address.  Therefore who would know it was me?
<BR>

<BR>
Like I said many of the hackers out there are university students and professionals.  This belief that they are all teenage boys who couldn't get into a University is bullshit.
<BR>

<BR>
Here's an excerpt from an Article in Smart Computing that includes quotes from Vincent Weafer from Symmantec (you know the Norton Anti-Virus guys who are known for saving Microsoft's ass so many times).  It proves that you and the rest of the supposed intellectuals have been living in a cave for the last 15 years:
<BR>

<BR>
Once upon a time, it was a popular belief that hackers and virus writer fit a certain profile.  They were thought to be males aged 14 to 25, with stunted social habits and attitude, who wanted to show the world and their friends what they could do.
<BR>

<BR>
But that profile has become dated, suggests Vincent Weafer, senior director of Symmantec's AntiVirus Research Center (http://www.sarc.com).  "We once considered that hackers and virus writters were two entirely different groups; now they are often the same." Weafer says.  "The writers are both younger and older and the list includes males and females."
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I have read your other posts and find that you are obviously NOT a professioanl or else you wouldn't call for a ban on things like the COMMAND PROMPT, because you think it's nothing but a hacker tool.  I'd seriously like to see you repair a Windows installation without it.
<BR>

<BR>
You want to ban things?  Then call for a petition that these things be removed from your own version or from home version entirely.  The rest of us will be using professioanl version of the software and growing smarter and richer.  Why because of your inability to do ANYTHING beyond point-and-click.
<BR>

<BR>
You prposal doen't just limit programmers.  Removing such tools doesn't just affect programmers.  It affects tech support and network administrators, and engineers.  And if you wanna call for a ban on hardware tell that to your neighbor who in high school with a home LAN used for gaming with all his buddies, that he can no longer use his hubs, switches, and routers.
<BR>

<BR>
I do not expect a response from you since you are already drowning yourself in your own stupidity.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

With such a flawed article, I assumed rightly that the postings feel easily into two camps: those who calmly and seriously pointed out how bogus your entire argument is, and those who just responded on an emotional level.  Both with varying degrees of clarity.  Typical /. stuff.

<BR>

<BR>
However, I don't think you've gone far enough.  Large companies like Microsoft and IBM routinely hire _university students_ right out of school.  These new hires are rarely, if ever, screened or interviewed on any criteria other than technical ability!  Talk about a danger to society!  Universities are known to be hotbeds of political malcontents and terrorists.
<BR>

<BR>
I think we should create a huge, government-sponsered clearing house of code for private and public use.  Programmers would be hired to work on only small parts of an application, without knowledge of the whole thing, or even what the application does.
<BR>

<BR>
Only then can we be safe from un-American hackers possibly lurking behind every application.

<BR>

<BR>
Okay
<BR>

<BR>
I know that this thread has been left alone for a fair while, but I'veonly just stumbled across it and I want to throw my own arguments into the ring.
<BR>

<BR>
I agree with what most of the people arguing the case to allow programming have said. I am a programmer. I own computers. But guess what? I don't work for any large companies. I'm 18 years old (by someone's definition a "teenage wannabe"). I'm a hobbyist who knows his way round Windows, is experimenting with Linux and other Unix variants, and can program to a reasonable level.
<BR>

<BR>
Does this make me dangerous? No. Have I written any software with malicious and/or hidden payloads purely for the sake of it? No. Have I done the last thing for a REASON? No. Even a fair number of people who have created malicious viruses or broken into the computer systems don't actually have malicious intent - they are trying to  highlight where there are weaknesses and loopholes in systems, and a significant proportion of malicious viruses that can be picked up by modern virus scanners never made it into the wild - they were simply sent straight to the antivirus companies and served to demonstrate where there were weaknesses in the systems at which the payloads were targeted.
<BR>

<BR>
The fact is, the explosion of the software industry was kickstarted by hobbyists. Hobbyists are the people who originally built the first computers hundreds of years ago. Hobbyists are people who started the large corporations churning out the software we use. If we are to apply what the writer of the original article is saying then by definition Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and a shedload of other people should have been imprisoned decades ago. Bill Gates originally wrote the Windows software as a hobbyist. And you know what? Windows NT contains code ripped from BSD Unix, a "hacker" operating system. 
<BR>

<BR>
The argument that people should have absolutely no programming experience until they are licensed to do so, or enter programming education also does not stand up. What will happen is that as no-one is allowed programming experience, very very few will know whether they enjoy it and want to take it up as a career, so only a tiny number of people will enter education, graduate and be licensed and enter work. Also, some may decide that programming is not for them and drop out. So what then? The few who do graduate and enter work programming will not be enough to keep the software industry working at any rapid pace, so innovations will be few and far between, computers will fall from grace and who knows what the result of that will be? The writer also fails to realise that there will still almost definitely be an underground programming movement. Look at the examples around us. A significant number of drugs are illegal, but the "industry", if legal would be worth billions of dollars. Or the music industry. New ways of protecting the artists are constantly being introduced but they almost always fall flat on their face - there is always someone who manages to break the protection.
<BR>

<BR>
If you take the argument (ban programming) to another level, then the statement that is making is verging on the ludicrous - a program is a series of instructions to be executed in a specific order, and if that does not happen then the the output is incorrect. If you take this literally then saying "ban programming" could also mean "ban algebra" - programming at its most basic IS algebra - there are set ways to solve any algebraic expression. The first computers were created to perform mathematical calculations.
<BR>

<BR>
Basically, what I am trying to say with this long meandering post is that banning hobbyist programming is a recipe for disaster - without it we wouldn't be where we are today, and the writer of the original argument is making very large generalisations and very woolly statements. I agree that not all programmers are honest, some are simply "teenage wannabes", but I know that I am not - I take a great interest in computers in general, and programming is part of making a computer do what you want it to do, so to ban it would make a very great deal of people very unhappy.
<BR>

<BR>
Just think before making generalisations like "Unix users are hackers" or "Programmers might possibly write viruses so they are all a threat to us good honest non-programming computer users".<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So sure, you may hack and steal, vandalizing you way across the Internet, and tell yourself that you are associated with these mythical "White Hats" that no one has ever seen in the flesh.   But everyone knows hackers by their handiwork, not by their phoney words.  Who do you think you're fooling?  <BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>

I think the first thing I will do is open an email or download a program from someone I do not know.  Oh no, now I have a virus because I am an idiot, I think I will blame hackers.

News flash!! Anti virus programs will stop 98% a viruses.

<BR>
News flash!! Hackers made the first anti virus program.

<BR>
News flash!! Without amatuer programmers Microsoft and Apple would not exist.

Hackers have done more good than you could possibly know.  You know why the government is so open with us about it's war a terrorism?  Because if they were not hackers would tell us.  Freedom of information and knowage should be important to all Americans.

Windows XP product activation is stupid. Hackers come up with cd key gens and when you get the right key hat is unactivated you activate it then someone who buys xp ends up not being able to activate it and calls microsoft and they cant figure out whats going on. GO MICROSOFT! YOU MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE!<BR><BR></FONT></td>
