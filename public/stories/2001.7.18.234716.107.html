		<a href="http://www.libertynet.org/~edcivic/village.html">Children are our future</a>.  Every <a href="http://www.linguafranca.com/print/0104/cover_healer.html">child</a> born into this world is a unique <a href="http://fly.cc.fer.hr/~shlede/lyr/greatest.html">individual</a>, <a href="http://www.amiright.com/misheard/artist/houstonwhitney.shtml">precious</a> for its own sake, and with its own new set of rights.  Sadly, many <a href="http://www.us.net/indc/hvillag.htm">children</a> born today, even in <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bh.html">advanced economies</a>, are prevented from becoming the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/">successful</a>, <a href="http://www.webho.com/WealthClock">well-rounded</a> <a href="http://www.clickz.com/article/cz.3240.html">adults</a> they deserve to be, simply because their <a href="http://www.addamsfamily.com/">parents</a> are <a href="http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/menendez/">poor</a>, or <a href="http://members.aol.com/halle8/jonbenet.htm">ill-educated</a>, or <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486279901.html">irresponsible</a>.  It's time to start addressing this problem, and to face up to the <a href="http://www.moveon.org/savecharity/">massive transfer of resources</a> it will entail.<p>

Furthermore, opening up the <a href="http://www.mass-debate.net/">debate</a> on taxing the <a href="http://www.babyzone.com/features/expertsqa/default.asp?QAID=1984&ExpertID=7">childless</a> offers us the opportunity to correct a significant anomaly in the current democratic system.  At present, sensible, long-sighted public policies, like reducing emissions under the <a href="http://www.algoreisourpresident.com/agiop-0501.html">Kyoto Accord</a>, or massively increasing federal <a href="http://www.seumas.com/articles/littlebastards.html">child</a> benefits, are impossible to pass as legislation, due to the short-termist, myopic attitude of our political process.  Throughout our society, most of our most pressing problems can be put down to a failure to take the long-term view.<p>
Is this failure to think of the future unconnected to the <a href="http://www.women.com/pregnancy/doc/sperm.html">childlessness</a> epidemic, identified by my colleague <a href="../users/11/index.html">Elby</a> in his <a href="./2001.7.15.204614.347.html">column</a> last week?  I think not.

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Parents are systematically more likely to think of the future of our planet and our society, because their <a href="http://www.halfbakery.com/idea/St._20Joseph_20Children_27s_20Valium">children</a> and the prospect of further generations of descendants give them a long-term stake in that future.  <a href="http://www.herts.fertility.btinternet.co.uk/html/content/stories/phil_and_julia.htm">Childless</a> people, in the knowledge that they are a Darwinian blind alley, take a far more nihilistic, me-first attitude to the problems of the world.  The <a href="http://www.informinc.co.uk/menshealth/">childlessness</a> epidemic of the last twenty years has meant that this <a href="http://www.lp.org">selfish</a>ness has become unacceptably prevalent.<p>Nowhere is this phenomenon more obvious than in the plight of our <a href="http://www.columbus.org/home.html">inner cities</a>.  Both the social phenomena identified above come together to create a problem of monstrous proportions.  <a href="http://gangstawars.thebackburner.com/">Underprivileged</a> youngsters are deprived of an education, of <a href="http://www.imac.com">mind-developing toys</a> and of the <a href="http://www.bmwra.org/eagle.htm">fashionable branded goods</a> which are so necessary for well-balanced development these days.   They grow up, not into productive members of society, but into damaged individuals - rootless, feckless, and most importantly <a href="http://www.johnnylucas.com/health/mens_8.htm">childless</a> young men, with no stake in our society, who therefore have no incentive to engage in anything other than the most destructive and mindlessly hedonistic of pursuits.  This pathological culture is not confined to the inner cities, of course; it spreads to the wealthy suburbs, where the modern, career-oriented couple considers the sacred Darwinian function of reproduction to be a "lifestyle choice", putting <a href="http://www.snopes2.com/radiotv/radio/bastards.htm">children</a> second to the demands of a modern, two-career, multiple-SUV household.  Is it any wonder that people with such <a href="http://www.lp.org">selfish</a>, warped priorities end up voting for <a href="http://www.algoreisourpresident.com/agiop-0501.html">George W Bush?</a><p>

Given the twin problems of underprivileged <a href="http://members.xoom.com/Amber_26/webring.htm">children</a> and socially harmful <a href="http://www.ohyesuare.com/content/index.cfm?contentID=2592">childlessness</a>, an economist's answer to the problem would be simple - a fiscally neutral "tax vice to subsidise virtue" program.  This is the first half of the policy program we recommend, and it makes economic sense.  The only arguments against it are clearly fallacious, and typical of the self-serving anti-child lobby:<ul>

<li><b>"<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/xsci/suffer.htm">Children</a> are nobody's responsibility but their parents'"</b>.  A superficially attractive slogan, but one with no logic to it whatsoever.  If a <a href="http://www.roea.org/9807/ro00008.html">child</a> steals from your store, or vandalises your car, do we leave its chastisement to the parents?  Of course not.  Do we allow parents to make decisions on their <a href="http://postgazette.com/tv/20010513owen.asp">children</a>'s sexual maturity at the age of 8?  Of course not.  We recognise <a href="http://www.geocities.com/omenchronicles/omen2.html">children</a> for what they are; independent individuals with their own particular set of rights.  And the <a href="http://www.ajhakari.com/d/damienomen2.html">children</a> of this nation would seem to be at least as deserving of Federal subsidy as Boeing or Microsoft.

<li><b>"If people can't afford to support <a href="http://www.odints.com/cprodigy.html">children</a>, they shouldn't have them"</b>.  As discussed above, this is a dangerously stupid point of view.  The poorest segment of society is exactly that segment which <i>must</i> be encouraged to reproduce; otherwise it has no stake whatsoever in maintaining our society, economic or otherwise.  The idea that the poor should be deprived of the only significantly popular source of recreation which does not cost money, or of the opportunity to enjoy the unconditional love of the <a href="http://www.mommiedearest.com/">parent -child</a> relationship, is a recipe for violent revolution somewhere down the line.

<li><b>"We can't afford it</b>.  Nonsense.  What we <i>can't</i> afford is the current <a href="http://www.neoteny.org/a/aggression-sperm.html">childlessness</a> epidemic.  As Elby points out in his excellent column, this is suicidal at the national level; it also has grave economic consequences.   As we know, Social Security is bust, bust as a direct result of the <a href="http://www.netjeff.com/humor/item.cgi?file=AntiBarneySong">child-hating</a> <a href="http://www.lp.org">selfish</a>ness of the Baby Boom generation, and their irresponsible failure to bear enough <a href="http://apartments.about.com/realestate/apartments/library/weekly/aa073100b.htm?rnk=r3&terms=childfree">children</a> to pay their old age pensions.  We all benefit from the favourable demographic pyramid effect of a constantly growing population, and the <a href="http://www.aarons-jokes.com/joke-588.shtml">childless</a> actually benefit most of all, since they tend to live longer and thus collect more Social Security checks.  Some of the more enlightened nations of Europe have already begun to <a href="http://www.nerve.com/regulars/ThisWeekinSex/contents.asp?n=10">catch on to this</a>.</ul>

It would seem, then, that the economic logic of a tax-the-<a href="http://assm.asstr.org/erotica/sne/mari-aid.htm">childless</a> policy is indefensible.  However, unfortunately, as is always the case with these things, the political logic is less clear-cut.  In order to gain support for <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/vanderlinden/glitter.htm">child-friendly</a> policies, it is necessary to build a working majority of parents over the <a href="http://www.planababy.com/infertility.htm">childless</a>, something which is unlikely to exist given our current, <a href="http://now2000.com/cbc/">child-hating</a> tax system.  It is for this reason that we propose the second, more radical of the social reforms in the title of this column; double votes for parents.<p>

"Double votes for parents" is merely a crude rule of thumb aimed at enfranchising the future generations who are currently, disastrously, deprived of a voice in our political system.  In the discussion of <a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/viewtopic.php?topic=109&forum=1">long-term measures like the Kyoto Accord</a>, it is ludicrous that the very people who are likely to be most affected by the decision taken (the generation currently in swaddling <a href="http://www.nike.com">clothes</a>) are deprived of a vote by the very reason of their youth.  Taking their votes and putting them in the hands of responsible, loving parents is a first step toward correcting this towering injustice.  In the fullness of time, as we start taking decisions on matters such as genetic modification and deep space exploration, it may become necessary to increase the voting power of parents still further, to take account of expected future grandchildren and even later generations, but for now, it is pretty safe to assume that the more moderate reform would be sufficient to pass the sensible tax-the-<a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/1996/jun12/42350.html">childless</a> policy.<p>

This is clearly the way forward for America, and for other prosperous First World countries where the low birthrate has led to a culture of childlessness and its concomitant <a href="http://www.lp.org">selfish</a>ness.  With luck, we can reverse this destructive trend and look forward to a prosperous society, with sensible environmental policies.  After all, we owe to our <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/cgi-bin/id/A0758530.html">children</a>, and to our <a href="http://www.jax-inter.net/~cheryl/jfk.html">children's</a> <a href="http://www.deathsucks.com/jokes/johnkennedy.html">children</a>.  And to <a href="http://www.salon.com/directory/topics/chelsea_clinton/">each other's children.</a>

As well it should!  Deal with it, buddy, we the childless (or childfree, as we prefer to be called) are out there, and we're not going away as long as your spoiled breeder butts are pushing to marginalize us even further with tripe such as this.  
<BR>

<BR>
As for "family priorities" -- how dare you insinuate that our families are not a priority!  I happen to have a family too, and you'd better believe they come before my career.  Just because my family does not include genetic offspring in no way lessens its value.  And if it comes down to you spending time with your brats vs. my equally valid right to put work aside in favor of my spouse, my parents, my siblings, or anyone else I deeply love, you had better believe I am going to fight tooth and nail to NOT be treated as a second-class citizen.

Yes, I have more disposable income than I would if I were a slave to diapers, Gymboree, and Pokemon paraphernalia and their accompanying expense.  But I'm very much a member of the middle class, along with a good chunk of the childfree population.  Most of us are just pursuing our lives, working for a living just like you.  
<BR>

<BR>
How jealous must you be of our freedom to hallucinate perks and privileges that you can only dream of in your childridden state?  Our paychecks are already diminished with the burden of taxes we pay, like it or not, to fund the many deductions you and your squalling broods enjoy at our expense.
<BR>

<BR>
So, I'm selfish, am I?  Yes indeed, I'm so selfish that I can't bear the thought of adding another little superconsumer to an environment already stretched far beyond its capacity.  Shame on me for refusing to inflict the hereditary illness I carry onto an unsuspecting child.  How dare I opt out of parenthood when I too might enjoy the guilty pleasure of pumping out little DNA replicas to ensure my "immortality" -- it's not as if I'm personally capable of making a contribution to society through my own hard work and creativity.  I'm not taking the easy way out -- imagine that!
<BR>

<BR>
We surely do need a double tax ... but it should rightfully fall to the breeders who continue to infest an overcrowded world with *their* selfish desire to replicate their pathetic selves.   Given what I've seen of the upcoming generation, I'm still waiting to meet these altruistic parents who only have the best interests of society in mind as they continue to breed irresponsibly.  Get back to me in 30 years and we'll see just who's really thinking of the future.  I can hardly wait.

Well, I feel that a 3 week old baby really can't raise herself, so I'll stick around. She may have my genes, but I feel the environment shapes a child much more than the genes. Also, we rely on our parents an awful lot, child rearing is a ardous undertaking, so I would like to be as helpful to my children as our parents are to us.<BR><BR><BR>

As far as my taxes go, you already get more than enough of them through school taxes and tax credits. Children are a choice. You should have thought about the expense of raising one before you had it. Bed. Made. Lie. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Speaking of which, smart guy, did you bother to check your genetic history before making this child? I ask, because, since "we" are so selfish, SOME of "us" have checked our genetic background, and would NOT like to pass along genetic defects/issues to the next generation to suffer through.

Not true.  The $500 deduction you get on your income taxes on your kid is truly offset by paying 30-some odd percent of your wages to the federal government because BOTH spouses are taxes are assessed at the same rate.  Ex. spouse 1 makes 60k and spouse 2 makes 20k...both get assessed at the same rate.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Great point! I meant to address the financial aspect of being CF in my initial response to this...person.
<BR>

<BR>
First of all, both my b/f and I, when we first met over 2 years ago, brought individual debt to the table: he with a student loan and some credit card debt, and me with credit card debt. To this day, we are keeping two steps ahead of the bill mongers (barely), even though we make a decent double income. It's STILL not enough to PROPERLY support even ONE child. What I mean by 'properly' is NOT going on welfare (this is not to say that being on welfare is BAD, but IMO, it can have a negative effect on kids), food stamps, WIC, etc., not having to keep borrowing money, and not being able to pay it back, having to decide how to spend money ("Do I spend it on food, or on getting the car fixed???"), and so forth. I do that already, and NO child is involved! So, this LIE about this so called glitzy lifestyle...who in the HELL is HE talking about, because he damned sure ain't talking about MY life!
<BR>

<BR>
Again, you bravely stated:
<BR>
"So, I'm selfish, am I? Yes indeed, I'm so selfish that I can't bear the thought of adding another little superconsumer to an environment already stretched far beyond its capacity. Shame on me for refusing to inflict the hereditary illness I carry onto an unsuspecting child. How dare I opt out of parenthood when I too might enjoy the guilty pleasure of pumping out little DNA replicas to ensure my "immortality" -- it's not as if I'm personally capable of making a contribution to society through my own hard work and creativity. I'm not taking the easy way out -- imagine that!"
<BR>

<BR>
Well stated!!!!!! Speaking again of being selfish...I wonder if it's being selfish (for some) to NOT reproduce because of unresolved issues from THEIR OWN childhood (dyfunction in the home: drug/alcohol use, molestation, rape, incest, etc.). Doesn't the mantra: "Stop the cycle" mean anything to those who would love for everyone to have kids? Yeah, tell that to the little boy who had to watch his father beat the crap out of his mom with an aluminum bat, then call 911. How do I know this? I had to do grand jury duty in 1996, and we had to listen to the 911 tape. Hope that young man won't follow in his dyfunctional dad's footsteps. We can only pray...
<BR>

<BR>
Hmph, talk about being selfish...oh yeah, let's have MORE children being born in situations not fit for a child, and like you said, "Get back to me in 30 years", and THEN let's see how the future REALLY is. Talk about a reality check!

<BR>
"I myself am getting sick of the childless continually griping about parents taking time off to be with their sick children, or being given preferential vacation time since their children are out of school, or being excused from long business trips because family is a priority. Sadly, this well thought out piece will bring more of the anti-children folk out of the woodwork."
<BR>

<BR>
Say WHA??? Truly you can not believe such as assine statement. First of all, let's "go to school" because you CLEARLY need to know the difference between CHILDFREE and CHILDLESS: ready...ok let's go.
<BR>

<BR>
One definition (and probably the best one)
<BR>
(from www.childfree.net)
<BR>
{We are a group of adults who all share at least one common desire: we do not wish to have children of our own. We are teachers, doctors, business owners, authors, computer experts - you name it. We choose to call ourselves "childfree" rather than "childless," because we feel the term "childless" implies that we're missing something we want - and we aren't. We consider ourselves childFREE - free of the loss of personal freedom, money, time and energy that having children requires.}
<BR>

<BR>
In addition, being childless usually refers to those who WANT kids, but can not, due to infertility issues, etc. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now that you've been taught that lesson, let's continue...
<BR>

<BR>
You continue to state:
<BR>
"If they would just honestly look inside themelves, they would realize that their lifestyle with expensive vacations, sports cars, nice clothing, nice houses are all just bandaids on their tortured souls, souls aching for a young one to call their own."
<BR>

<BR>
ROTFLMAO!!! Whew, you should take that act on the road dude...such laughable material!!!!! Baaaaaaaaahahahahaaaaaaa!! I can tell you THIS: MY life is full and enriched with my fiancee..no torturing of souls, no aching for a young one....pffft! So silly...
<BR>

<BR>
You continue to...try to say:
<BR>
"But, if they're still to selfish to have children, at least a double tax will help the next generation."
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, wrong again. To choose NOT to have children can not POSSIBLY be "selfish". Why? Again, school's in session:
<BR>

<BR>
1) 6,163,642,127 (at this posting)people can't be wrong.
<BR>
http://www.dayofsixbillion.org/home.htm
<BR>
http://www.unfpa.org/swp/swpmain.htm
<BR>

<BR>
2) The many children today (in the US) that are uninsured and under-cared for:
<BR>
http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/children.html
<BR>

<BR>
3) Each pregnancy is a health risk to women, even healty women. A pregnancy takes an unbelieveable toll on a woman's body and mind. 
<BR>
http://www.familyplanet.org/maternalhealth.htm
<BR>

<BR>
Now, since the earth's resources are being depleted due to consumption, and areas of land are being torn down to accomodate new families, the ozone layer is thinning (consumption again), the "next generation" won't have much to look forward to, now will they? Why even ADD to that growing population? 
<BR>

<BR>
So...how again are "we" selfish? I think "we" ARE thinking of the children when "we" decide NOT to have any. 
<BR>

<BR>
Remember: It's CHILDFREE, not CHILDLESS, ok? Ok! Class dismissed.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

In the USA just now, unemployment is at a record low. Unfortunately, it is the people with the most time on their hands who reproduce the most, so no wonder the reproduction rate is decreasing.<BR><BR>
If we want society to have more children, we should increase unemployment to perhaps 10-15% and provide massive social security and benifits, paid for by Corporate taxation.<BR><BR>
This would create a special breeder class, without any accompanying issues of Orwellian government control.<BR><BR>
It would also increase the intelligence of society. There is a statistical rule called `regression to the mean`. What this means is that children of highly intelligent parents tend to be slightly more unintelligent, closer to the mean, and the converse applies to the unintelligent. As only the unintelligent will be unemployed, and hence reproducing more, we can see that the overall level of intelligence of our nation would increase over time.<BR><BR>

<BR>
The reason why this will never happen in the United States is because we are not a socialistic society...we are capitalistic, which means that you make your own opportunities.  Supporting a bunch of loosers so that they can breed and stay at home watching soap operas is not my idea of an intelligent way of spending my tax dollars.  There are plenty of people in the world who are capable of working all of the jobs that everyone is so worried about being filled in 50 years.  Why not relax emegration laws so that the able can come here and create their own opportunities?  
<BR>

<BR>
In addition, the one thing that has not been brought up here is the idea that each child that is born in a more developed country KILLS up to 3 children born in a lessor developed country due to lack of resources.  If we want to look at how a pronatilist society benifits the world, why don't all of you breeders go to Rwanda and explain why your child has more of a God given right to live than theirs.

<BR><BR>Do you have any proof to back up that assertion?  Just to play devil's advocate, it seems to me that a lot of people become parents precisely because they <strong>cannot</strong> make a connection between short-term gratification (e.g. sex) and long-term consequences (e.g. children).  Many people who forego having children do so because they <strong>do</strong> take the long view and consider things like overpopulation.  Who's really thinking of "the future of our planet and our society"?
<blockquote><i>"Children are nobody's responsibility but their parents'". A superficially attractive slogan, but one with no logic to it whatsoever.</i></blockquote>
<BR><BR>I agree with you that everyone shares responsibility for children.  However, I resent your proposal of taxation without representation.  Yes, that's what it is.  If childless people are to be forced to pay for the rearing of children, they should have some say in how those children are raised, and yet you propose <strong>reducing</strong> childless people's proportional representation in the decision-making process.  It's the most selfish agenda imaginable.
<blockquote><i>We all benefit from the favourable demographic pyramid effect of a constantly growing population</i></blockquote>
<BR><BR>That would only be true if resources were infinite.  They're not.  That being the case, we actually all - throughout the world, in case you were thinking only in narrow terms of the US or other rich countries - suffer the effects of increasing overpopulation.
<blockquote><i>It would seem, then, that the economic logic of a tax-the-childless policy is indefensible</i></blockquote>

<BR>

<BR>
The vast majority of the childfree that I know are not bearing a fancy lifestyle 'as bandaids on their tortured souls'. I do not ache anymore for a young one of my own, I have (through the tremendous support that I have found on the Internet and elsewhere) healed myself and moved on.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the childfree not thinking about the next generation... simply untrue. I myself quit a banking job two years ago (once we decided we would not be having children) to go back to school. What for?  I am now a certified teacher, Kindergarten-Grade 6. CLEARLY I hate children, cannot be bothered about them, and couldn't care less about their futures. Honestly, how does "I do not have children" AUTOMATICALLY turn into "I hate children" or "I am too busy with my fancy lifestyle to have them"?
<BR>

<BR>
I think the real epidemic is not childlessness OR childbearing. I think it is a complete and utter lack of a willingness to consider the mere POSSIBILITY that both sides have merit. Parents do have a very difficult job, I do not argue this point. However, they CHOSE this job, and presumably had given it sufficient thought to know what would be involved. Many of the childfree DO like children (although some, frankly, do not, and I think that is their complete and utter right).
<BR>

<BR>
Rather than creating these false and damaging splits in society, would we not be better to try THINKING about things just a little bit??

I'd suggest that jsm does not go far enough with his proposal. Each parent should get an extra vote for every child they have. This way, we will get a society that is much more family-oriented and one which reflects the wishes of a lot more people than our current system does.<BR><BR>

<BR>
Birth control has ALWAYS been an option; as long ago as the late Roman period people were using contraceptives and sexual practices that would not result in conception. 
<BR>

<BR>
It has only been in recent history that contraception has been officially researched, mass produced, and effectively maintained thanks to technology. 
<BR>

<BR>
It is, however, by no means a luxury; luxury is indulging yourself, which is the opposite of depriving yourself. Believe me, as someone who has been seriously ill because of prescription birth control pills and has an extreme allergy to latex condoms, the luxury would be to say "the hell with it" and go dancing in the rain without a raincoat, so to speak. Carefully using birth control or going without sex when you don't have birth control to hand is deprivation.
<BR>

<BR>
To throw my cares to the wind and damn the consequences. To not have to consider or deal with repercussions-- now THAT is luxury. After all, the village will be there to raise the child I didn't even want-- won't it?

Put it this way: no kids from me means more places in over-crowded schools and beds in over-stretched hospitals for your children. Sounds different when I put it that way, doesn't it?

<BR>

<BR>
I mean, if there weren't CF people around to take up the slack, things would fall apart, wouldn't they? While you raise your kids, we teach them, keep the Internet running, man your fire, police, stores, farms, distribution centers, etc. What I am trying to say is that we're all in this together.   
<BR>

<BR>
Am I rich? Not really. I already pay a significantly higher proportion of my taxes to support families. And I do not live in the 'lap of luxury' either. But I am rich in spiritual serenity and the luxury to savor long thoughts, books, and quiet afternoons if I so choose. 
<BR>

<BR>
Am I bitter? No. I have chosen the life path that is right for me, and that includes not having kids. I have no desire to raise them up in this rapidly disintigrating culture, or burden them with my genetic flaws. And I do not envy or hate people who do so, unless they irritate me with an entitlement-poisoned attitude, which seems to be becoming the norm. Having a baby doesn't make you a saint, and not having a baby doesn't make you a sinner. Making the correct choice simply makes you human. At least I understand my own limitations, and will not subject a child to them. You should not be so hateful to those intelligent enough to understand themselves enough to know that parenting is not for them. 
<BR>

<BR>
Even if I did have my own children, there is no guarantee that they would care for me in my old age. Most likely that task will fall to a foreign immigrant, as it is now, who will take care of you, too, parent. Don't count on your kids doing it. Many lonely old people in nursing homes have kids who rarely see them. The heartache in their eyes is palpable. All the sacrifice and work they did for their kids as babies has been forgotten, and their children are off somewhere else, their parents forgotten. 
<BR>

<BR>
I will take care of my own father when he reaches that stage of his life, if he chooses to permit me to do so. I won't have the excuse of kids of my own to keep me away. 
<BR>

<BR>
Not having kids of my own also permits me to interact with other kids, as a non parental adult mentor. They'll tell me things that they'd never tell their parents. And I gently steer them towards responsible adulthood, through my actions and writings. I can do this because I have some peaceful distance between myself, and living under the same roof with them. I can see things about them that you cannot. 
<BR>

<BR>
Really, instead of alienating those of us who have taken the road less traveled and not had kids, you should consider yourselves greatly fortunate to have us in your community. We'll pick up where you leave off, we'll keep the community running while you're off minding the kids, and we'll remind you that the village has many diverse people in it.
<BR>

<BR>
Remember that.

Some of us perform our responsibilities to the world in the here-and-now.  We don't breed, so we take that extra time and energy and spread it outside our homes.  Raising a child does not make the world a better place in the here-and-now.  A child is a misfit in society, ignorant of meaning, clumsy in relationships, and unspeakably unwise.  A child is a joy for the parents who delight in teaching it and a source of stress for everyone else.  A child has future potential.  An adult has here-and-now ability.

I have no trouble at all with paying my taxes so that all who live can afford to make good choices and get assistance when they need it.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">JSM's argument personally offends and makes me ill, because I'm childfree.  I'll spare him my vitriolic response, and my directions on where he can shove this.
<BR>

<BR>
Instead, because I'm aware of how democracy works, and I'm a logical person atop that, I'll restrict my objections to logic and common sense.
<BR>

<BR>
JSM's argument is weak; he provides no concrete evidence that taxing childfrees at higher rates and rendering "double vote" power to parents would improve society.  He speaks broadly of benefits to children, but without even anecdotal references to how this would benefit children any more than, say, an alternative (such as restricting the amount of children born, and thus raising the resources that can be contributed to each child's benefit). His distracting multiple hyperlinks are oblique and off-topic, and he provides no studies or hard research to bolster his claims that gouging the childfree is a panacea.  One can only assume that when he refers to "children" as beneficiaries, he means his own, and no others.
<BR>

<BR>
Worse, JSM's characterization of the childfree, and why they should be taxed higher, is rife with propaganda and personal prejudice.  He finds them morally bankrupt; so therefore, they should be taxed heavily to subsidize those who have children -- those, in his view, who are morally superior.  A tax structure based on perceived morality works well for the Taliban regime, I'm sure -- along with abolition of the Internet and executions of women who expose their faces in public.
<BR>

<BR>
Here in the West, however, even "sin taxes" on tobacco and alcohol are controversial, and not necessarily just.  The biggest problem with morality taxation is that tax revenues fluctuate with the party in power.  Let's speak hypothetically:  right now, President Bush may feel it's appropriate to tax women who have abortions, or people who order pornography online, at a higher rate than the rest of taxpayers.  So for a few years, there's all this (unjust) revenue exacted from people who have simply exercised their civil rights.  New government programs are funded.  Maybe the down payment is made on some new weapons.  Along comes the next president, who, we hope, has her head screwed on straight, and abolishes these morally-punitive taxes.  Now the weapons payments are in default, and the government programs have to be scrapped.
<BR>

<BR>
I agree, too, that taxing the childfree is taxation without representation.  Should I disagree with the way our tax dollars are currently spent, I can certainly write my Congressional reps.  Certainly, today's parents would not allow me a democratic hand in their own childrearing, even while their rummaging in my pockets for funds for new "special" schools for high school dropouts or other underage ne'er-do-wells.
<BR>

<BR>
As far as the throwaway "double vote" issue is concerned, it's unConstitutional, and will never fly, at least in the U.S.  The sanctity of our voting rights lies in individual reason, not reproductive prowess.  This is deliberate; it's an antidote to voting laws that ensured only wealthy property owners would have a voice in government.  Children are the personal property of parents; they may be raised almost entirely according to parental will, and only certain people can afford to have children.  Guaranteeing advanced voting privileges to parents is a regression to the ancient "no property, no vote" theory of government.  JSM has simply substituted what he feels is the best and most moral kind of property one can have.  He might just as easily have said, "anyone who owns a Barcalounger should get double votes."  Good luck getting this theory to fly. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>
Once this childless tax is initiated, I think it would be reckless to not institute a mate-free exception to the tax. All the unattractive (physically and emotionally) people of the world who want children, but can't find anyone desperate enough to procreate with them would be unfairly hit by a tax meant for the nihlistic bastards who are out to end our species by refusing to donate their reproductive capabilities to another for the common good.
<BR><BR>
I believe strongly that those who refuse to reproduce should be punished, but those incapable of reproducing by social reason or by inability to do so shouldn't be punished for their disabilities. This is about putting our foot down in favor of child-bearing not causing economic stress to the weak.<BR><br>

<BR>
As Woody Allen once said,(and I paraphrase, not remembering the exact quote) "Any idiot can have children and most do."  Now the rest of society should pay because you went and had kid's without ever thinking about it?  Get a clue.  
<BR>

<BR>
What you should be advocating is education and laws to require a license to have children.  We require people to take tests and pass exams for all kinds of things but any loser can go out and have kids without evey thinking about what it takes to raise and pay for children.  The fact of the matter is, if we made it a little more difficult and required parents to pay their fair share(instead of giving them extra tax breaks and encouraging world overpopulation and the destrucion of the planet) many people would have fewer children and some would have non at all.
<BR>

<BR>
Some people actually *think* before running out and procreating, imagine that!  Some people decide the world is overpopulated or that they wouldn't make the best parents so the decide to remain child-less.

These are some of the smartest, most open minded people I know. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Really clever ones translate it to "I really have no reasons I want to tell you about" or "I just think it's a good idea" or "I want to coat the whole world in 5 layers of nerf so a child won't even die falling out of an airplane".

However, people with children seem to fall for this tripe left and right.  We have to bomb a country for the children!  Ya!  (But won't the bombs hit children?)  We have to disarm the whole country for the sake of the children!  Ya!  (Is there some way other than a gun that an 80 year old woman can defend herself from a mugger?)  We have to tax you for the children!  We have to know where you are at every moment for the children!  We have to kill all the adults to make room for the children!

Children, children, children!  You parents need to learn how to raise a kid that won't get crazy with an UZI after being rejected by his peers, that's what needs to be done for the children!<BR><BR></FONT></td>
