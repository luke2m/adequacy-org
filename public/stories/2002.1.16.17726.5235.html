		Everyone [who is a geek] has heard of the <a href="http://www.riaa.com">record industry</a> and its <a href="http://content.techweb.com/wire/story/TWB20000725S0014"> lawsuit</a> against <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a>. 
<p>
But not many people are aware that since then, the Record Industry has been unfairly [victimized, and so has been courageously] filing lawsuits against anything else it [accurately] percieves as a threat using the [not] false preten[s]es of copyright infringement [but rather sound legal judgement and common sense].
<p>
This article is [a big long wank] about the current state of internet file [stealing] and how its future is being threatened by the bullying tactics of the [hacker mafia against the] record industry.
<p> 
It also adresses how the [brave and just] RIIA's claim of "copyright violation" against many [stolen] file sharing clients is flawed and wrong [in the eyes of hackers who will say anything, but not the general public, nor the legal system].

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><b>What is [stolen] file sharing?</b>
<p>
Put simply [but pompously] it is a method for many different [criminal] users to share [stolen] files on their computers with each other. This creates a sort of [illegal] "shared network" of [stolen] files. [For a criminal] To connect to such a[n illegal] network you first have to install a [contraband] client - such as [outlawed] Napster. Once your client connects, you can [maliciously] view and download shared [stolen] files from anyone else running the same [criminal] client. 
<p>
<b>Why does the Record Industry find [stolen] file sharing such a [genuine] threat?</b>
<p>
The [artistically creative and socially legitimate] record industry has always been <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/jour/catbytes/s99/riaastanceonmp3.html">opposed to [the hacker tool] MP3</a>; the [illegal] file format used for [stolen] music as they are generally opposed to most [anti-social] technical advances - mainly because they can[']t handle them [without help from our brave law enforcement agencies] and because they don[']t like anything which they can[']t make [well-earned, honest] money out of. Just read this  <a href="http://www.dotcomscoop.com/article.php?sid=40">Leaked [and probably fake] document</a> from the RIIA asking competitors to join together to shutdown [illegal] file sharing networks [of malajusted hacker terrorists with no girlfriends].
<p>
The main argument that the record industry makes is that [illegal] file sharing clients are encouraging [damnedable] Copyright Infringement by allowing [heinous] MP3 music files of copyrighted music to be shared [illegally]. As I will show later [at tedious length] this argument is wrong [in the eyes of many drug-crazed hackers]and is being used by the record industry as an "easy way out" of the [devastating] piracy problem [that plagues ordinary folks and our whole economic well-being].

We [wanker hackers] all know the story of <a href="http://www.napster.com">[wicked, wicked] Napster</a> - the once great [evil] music sharing network [of thieves] who now, unfortunately [are] a wreck [ha ha!], its [weasel] users leaving in [cowardly] droves [back to the hives of scum and stinking gutters from which they slitered up]thanks to lawsuits from powerful record companies including Sony Music, Time Warner, EMI Group and Universal Music amongst others[, companies responsible for bringing countless hours of beloved entertainment to millions of grateful customers around the globe].
<p>
In its court case it was decided that [the criminal] Napster [mafia] did "aid" users to [blatantly] violate [just and necessary] copyrights and that [the evil] Napster [syndicate] had [diabolical] control over its [craven minions] but didnt exercise it to prevent the violations [of our nation's democratically created laws].
Well if Napster has been "brought down" by the [valiant] Record Industry [ha ha!] then who's next? [More hackers, that's who]  Have these giant corperations really gained control over [illegal] internet file sharing? 
<p>
<b>The present state of Internet File [Stealing]</b>
<p>
In many [many, many] ways there were legitimate grounds for shutting [those crooks at] napster down in that they did have the power to prevent [their criminal]users violating copyright but to use Napster as an example of the fate of all file sharing networks would be [not be] wrong.
There are many other [crimial] file [stealing] networks out there: <a href="http://www.gnutellanews.com/information/what_is_gnutella.shtml">Gnutella</a>, <a href="http://www.musiccity.com/">Morpheus</a>, Kazaa and WinMX to name a few [of these dastardly gangs of miscreants].
Law suits are already beginning against Morpheus and Kazaa so is [stolen] file sharing soon to become a [not missed] thing of the past?
<p>
The strong contender for survival [of evil] here has to be the <a href="http://www.gnutellanews.com/information/what_is_gnutella.shtml">Gnutella [Al-Quaida] network</a>. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.gnutelliums.com/">many different [illegal] Gnutella clients</a> available for [Micro-Soft] Windows, L[u]nux and Mac[-Intosh] which all use the same network, the record industry would have to file lawsuits against the authors of each of them.
Also, unlike Napster, the [insideous] Gnutella network has no centralized server - all the [criminal] users are directly connected. This makes it very difficult for the Record Industry to shut them down. Sure, they might be able to shut down the [criminal] authors who made the [contraband] clients, but people [of ill-intent] would still be able to use and distribute the [satan-spawned] clients freely anyway.
<p>
For example, the authors of one of the [most destructive] Gnutella clients, <a href="http://www.xolox.nl">Xolox</a>, recently stopped allowing people from downloading their [illegal] client from their site because they were scared of a lawsuit [that would bring them to justice]. As they say on their site, they dont think they are in the wrong but they dont have the money to fight the large record companies.
Funnily enough, a <a href="http://all2all.virtualave.net/p2p/">cracked version of Xolox</a> appeared just hours later which was fully functional. Now who can the Record Industry file a lawsuit against now that the program no longer has an author?  [The only possbility is to arrest all hackers and make them share the punishment, and to ban all hacking tools.]
<p>
Some [brazenly criminal] Gnutella client authors have taken the opposite defence, charging in rather than running away:
<p>
The <a href="http://www.limewire.org">Limewire</a> client team [of crooks] are trying to develop the network in such a way so that it is impossible for anyone to shut it down [putting decent people everywhere at their mercy.  Who will save us?].
They have made the [illegal] Limewire client Open Source so that any [criminal] can download the [illegal] source code and develop their own [illegal] clients. In fact, Limewire's site has an entire section dedicated to [evil] developers. Now that the [contraband] source code for the Gnutella network is released then what chance do the Record Industry have of ever stopping [illegal] file [stealing]?
<p>
<b>Why the Record Companies are [not] wrong and can[']t [but] win</b>
<p>
You might argue that the record companies are just trying to get more [fair] profit and prevent [wicked] people pirating their music but shouldn[']t they be filing lawsuits againt the [criminal] users who violate copyright instead of the [criminal] authors of [hardly] legitimate [stealing] software? 
In [evil] networks such as Gnutella, the [criminal] authors have no control over the [viral] program and whether it is used illegally or legally once it is distributed. More[over], they are not even making any profit out of their clients [but rather are motivated by pure evil] so all pass all the violation criteria that Napster failed on in court. 
<p>
So why exactly is the Record Industry attacking the [wicked, wicked] authors of software rather than the actual [criminal] people doing the infringing?
Well As the [zitty, pasty] founder of LimeWire said:
<p>
<i>There's nothing inherently different about it than e-mail. People trade illegal things all the time, and the RIAA should go after those [nasty] people. But they don't, because those [damn]people are their [fucken] customers. So they go after some [equally culpable] third party [Shit.]</i>
<p>
So it seems that the Record Industry [not] using the wrong means to achieve their [and society's] goal. That[']s if <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-2306997.html">their goal is right anyway</a>[, which it is].

[T]hey are in fact doing so for [valid] commercial reasons.
The truth of the matter is that the facts speak for themselves: 
<p>
-There were over 1.6 million [evil, criminal] Napster users online at any one time during Napsters peak.
-There are now 600,000 [drug-addled] Morpheus users online at any one time.
-Over 1 million [illegal] copies of Morpheus are downloaded every week.
<p>
The facts say that a huge [portion] of the [scofflaw] public [is] indeed what the Record Industry would call [damnedable] "Copyright Infringers". Rather than admit this fact that their [illigimate] customer base is into piracy on a big scale, the Record Industry prefers [not] to sneak around blaming individual entities for millions of other people[']s actions.
<p>
<b>The Future of [Illegal] File Sharing</b>
It seems obvious that the Record Industry will try to crush the file sharing networks and we will witness a real [triumph] of the justice system [over the evil-doers]. Will the courts take the right decision and tell the RIIA that they should [go on] target[ing] the real criminals or will money and power corrupt the law into siding with large entertainment corperations?      <br><br></div>

Basically, I think that it should be up to the artists whether or not the mp3s are legal. If an artist wants to release free music, why stop them? Similiarly, if an artist worked hard on his/her music and wants to collect money for it, you can't stop them from doing that, either. I download mp3s of lesser-known bands to see if I like their music or not, and then buy the CDs if I like them.
<BR><BR>
I think it's important to mention, though, that the MPAA freaked out when VHS came out, and the RIAA freaked when the cassette tapes came out. What they don't realize is that people buy CDs for convenience--it's easier to just buy it than burn it. Also, if you buy it, it comes with liner notes, photographs, etc., or at least it should, to give people the incentive to buy instead of burn. The more extra stuff you package with the CD, the better your chances of selling it.

I like the concept of an 'album', which some bands make great use of, so that the number and order of the songs contributes to the experience. Somehow, listening to a CD feels more 'real' than listening to an MP3, even though it's pumped through the same stereo and sounds mostly the same.<BR><BR>
But I still download tons of MP3s because, like it or not, most music out there is shit. Paying for a CD and then finding out it was pure garbage is incredibly frustrating. I'm in the habit of downloading as many albums of music as I want, then picking only the very best and buying only those particular CDs and adding them to my collection.<BR><BR>
MP3s are cool, because without MP3s, my CD collection would be much less exciting, and my money would have gone to support artists I didn't like.

Also, it would really suck if a song from another album got in there, because that album has its own sound and mood. You can make a playlist, but add in the insert and I'd much rather have the CD, the body of work, than some idea of these 'files' floating around on my hard drive.<BR><BR>
One thing that does bother me, though, is that the RIAA says that when you buy a CD, you are actually buying the rights to listen to that music, so you can't really copy it. My question is this: what if my house burns down, and the CD is melted? Since the CD was only the method of delivery, am I entitled to a new one, since I have bought the 'rights' for one unit of "Album X"?

This is the opposite of what they say when someone has a pirated CD - then it is considered exactly the same as the real copy and therefore illegal.

I think I heard somewhere that if you have bought a CD you can legally download MP3's of that CD but then again it might count as having two copies and you only paid for one (even though they are all supposed to be the same?)

Duh. What can I tell you -- buy insurance. As for the rest of your comment, the RIAA's rhetoric is no better than your own. You smuggle  quite a few assumptions about  property and theft that arent shared by society at large and which, if they were true, would make nonsense of our economic relations. Let me make it real easy for you. Law doesnt recognise copyright infringement as theft,  but your clue that it might still very obviously be illegal is the word 'infringement'.
<BR><BR>
It doesnt matter what you people say, file sharing over networks constitutes copyright infringment. It's not the end of the world and well intentioned people arent going to impose overly harsh restrictions on themselves to evade  the convenience of modern technology, but dont expect copyright holders to make it easy for <i>thieves</i>, and dont expect reasonable people to believe  information wants to be free. Only hackers believe information wants to be free because, uncoincidentally, they are incapable of producing any 'information' worth protecting.

Yes, they can be, but arent. Why? Because they if they had intrinsic value, that value would be protected by copyright. That means the files have restrictions upon their use, just like the GPL Freedom Software you so tirelessly defend on this site. Believe me, if I had no conscience, I would write a file sharing app that disguises gpl code beyond recognition; but I wont do that because I respect the GPL's list of copyright restrictions, not because I dont think the consequent FSF and Open Source rhetoric would make the RIAA's sound like pillow talk.

I agree that lots of free files can be explained this way but that doesnt mean they shouldnt be shared or shouldnt exist does it?
Also if you visit MP3 websites (legal ones) you will find lots of unsigned bands actually use the internet to freely distribute their music. They <i>could</i> copyright their songs but what they want is recognition and the internet is the best way to distribute for cheap.
These are the people who suffer if file sharing apps are illegalised.<BR>&lt;&lt;JUMP! POGO POGO POGO BOUNCE! POGO POGO POGO&gt;><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Yes I agree.
<BR>
But most music on the internet isnt illegal and is produced by unsigned artists who use the internet to distribute their work for free. Even some signed bands have distributed free songs now and again for the publicity. So to ban file sharing because it might allow the few illegal MP3s to be copied would actually discriminate against the majority of MP3s which are legally free and discriminate against thousands of artists hard work.

The record industry are only trying to monopolise and prevent any other form of music distribution other than buying CDs in shops.

A great strategy would be to directly buy the music from the artists website. This way the customer pays less and the artist get more and no CDs are needed. I hope this will become commonplace soon.

Maybe the record industry should get their shit together and sort out a way of letting people preview music before they buy it instead of us having to find out our own ways.
<BR>

<BR>
When 10's of millions of people have broken a law you have to ask yourself why that is, instead of simply calling everyone criminals. Why, for example do so many people pirate music without having a moral problem with it? is it because its overpriced maybe? Is it also because the sale structure is flawed and inflexible? You might even reach the conclusion that this law isnt democratically accepted. 
<BR>
If I want to own 10 songs from different albums its going to cost me $100 whereas if I want to own 10 songs from 1 album it only costs me about $20...thats a giant ripoff which just goes to show how much profit is being made from 1 song.
<BR>

<BR>
A group of friends will no doubt have their own CDs. Then they will probably share music tastes with each other. But in your perfect world its illegal for one of them to borrow a friends CD. 
<BR>

<BR>
Of course im looking at one of my legally purchased CD's now. I dont see anything saying "dont copy this CD" - no license agreement or any shit. With software you get bundles of paragraphs of text explaining your rights and the license to you in extreme detail. How have the record industry got away without doing this?
<BR>
One single 'C' doesnt mean shit. All it says to me is dont copy this physical CD - or dont copy this cover. It doesnt say dont copy the music on the CD, neither does it explain for example what exactly I own on this CD - do I own the actual right to listen to the music on the CD or just this CD. I mean, can I now legally download MP3's of this CD because I now have rights to own the music? or will I be sued for doing so.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe this is why noone has ever been taken to court for downloading music. A good argument would simply be: "But I had the original CD so I was allowed to download it. Unfortunately I cant prove this as I melted the CD after I downloaded the music. But I dont have to prove anything - thats the prosecutions job"<BR>&lt;&lt;JUMP! POGO POGO POGO BOUNCE!

Wow. You're just out to piss off an entire continent, if not two or three. Better get the Jews, you know how corrupt they are. First of all, do NOT call someone immoral or anything else because of their race. That is beyond ignorant. And as for the rape comparison, if you consulted computer users and people out in the street, I think you would find a little bigger majority of computer users would support file-sharing than people would support rape. Whether you win by a republic vote or outright warfare, it's all about the number of people you can get to follow an idea.

Typical of RIAA: "Buy the album and don't bitch about how you didn't like any other song on it." We will give you shit, you will buy shit, and you will like it. We can treat customers like this because they have to get the music through us. Hold it.
<BR>

And that was a pretty handy way to dodge his question. Did you ever find that license agreement? And don't even tell me you've never pirated software, because your comment implies you think it is a pretty ordinary thing. If you've pirated even one software title, you are a hypocrite. Songs, software, it's seen basically the same in the eyes of the law: don't copy it without permission.

And face it, as far as the RIAA and prosecuting single users on a dynamic-ip link that don't host any sort of ftp or otherwise illegal site (only d/l, no online distribution, 56k forever!), I'll wait for my turn about the time I pull my first Social Security check.

And by the way, I do buy quite a few albums, but only ones that I think are worth the money.  Why should I have to pay $20 for two good songs, which is about all you'll find in a lot of CDs.
<BR>

<BR>
Ah, yes, and thanks for informing me that everyone who uses peer-sharing regularly is a college student. I even hear a college student wrote Napster. Maybe we should just raid colleges, you know, get to the source.
<BR>

<BR>
I read quite a lot of articles, but I listen to numbers most of all. Overall sales surged during the boom, period.
<BR>

<BR>
And I admit, it is the artists that are going to suffer. To them I say: set up your own site, sell me the CD direct for 8$ plus s&h, and I'll be happy. And yes, they might have to sign a label to start up, but tell me Metallica and fucking P Diddy don't have the cash to go indie.
<BR>
Then they can actually enjoy a fair share of the profit.

My article wasnt a non-depth the law is wrong but an argument as to why the authors of peer to peer systems are not the law breakers. It is hardly a program writers fault if users misuse their program for illegal activities.

Like you wouldnt file a lawsuit against the postal service just because it allows people to post hate mail would you?
Or sue General Motors because they allow people to joyride.

No, in those cases you go for the real culprits - the actual criminals.

The fact is that peer to peer systems arent big money business and the music industry is. So in this case the law has been twisted.<BR>&lt;&lt;JUMP! POGO POGO POGO BOUNCE! POGO POGO POGO&gt;><BR></FONT></td>

I disagree that your article was controversial in any way. As you said yourself, "<i>There were over 1.6 million Napster users online at any one time during Napsters peak. -There are now 600,000 Morpheus users online at any one time. -Over 1 million copies of Morpheus are downloaded every week</i>". How is it controversial to reassure a million people that what they're doing is good, acceptable and morally defensible?<BR><BR>
<i>If I had written an unoriginal article from the point of view of the record industries then I doubt it would have been editted at all.</i><BR><BR>
You're right, it wouldn't have been edited. It also wouldn't have been posted. In fact, without elenchos' intervention, this article wouldn't have been posted either. Elenchos's editing turned a Kuro5hin/Slashdot-style article that wouldn't be of interest to Adequacy's readership, into something that some of us found amusing. You should really thank elenchos for editing your article, for without him all your hard work writing the article would have gone to waste.

Adequacy's never been the same since we publicised the site to people who weren't on <a href="../../special/who.html">The Who? Page</a>. For a brief couple of weeks when we had just 30 or so users, the server was fast and there were no users abusing the site by posting illiterate comments or trolls. I miss the good old days. I think it's time that we shut our doors to the unwashed masses and returned to our roots as a discussion site for a <a href="../../special/who.html">select few members of the intellectual elite</a>.<BR><BR><BR><i>Adequacy.org - love it or <a href="http://www.adequacy.org/?op=logout">leave it.</a></i><BR></FONT></td>

Yes yes, sealing ourselves off from the common rabble would be quite nice, but this is much more fun - we get to openly spit on the flawed logic and subpar prose of the lesser masses from the secure enclosure of our respective ivory towers. And we enjoy the power, do we not?

In most cases I've witnessed so far, those who claim to be the "intellectual elite" are usually neither. It is sad to see that "News for Grown-ups" consist of petty arguments about punctuation, grammar, spelling and power-tripping, mutual-ego boosting grossly unproportional, malformed, spoon-fed opinions that simple-minded "adults" would mistake for intellect. A bit less mutual back scratching and more controversy would be a nice change. At least there's a nice mix of cultists here, Bible thumpers, Corporate yes-(wo)men, Linux Zealots alike. I suppose not all is lost, since the essence of this site is to capture the best and worst of human conditions.

<BR>

<BR>
-It wasnt contraversial.
<BR>
-It was about the record industry - a boring topic.
<BR>
-It wasnt what people wanted to read.
<BR>

<BR>
Well lets take your biased pro-record industry post shall we.
<BR>
-It was less contraversial than mine definitely. A typical media sum up of the "isnt it great" record industry.
<BR>
-It was also about the record industry - a boring topic is what Elenchos and Iat said.
<BR>
-Why the hell do you think people wanted to read yours? It was as full as opinion and lacking in fact as mine was there were as many people posting disagreeing comments as there are on mine. 
<BR>

<BR>
So whats the difference? 0 apart from the fact they were on completely different sides of the argument. 
<BR>
I dont denounce your article at all as it was good but im just saying that I believe the reasons that have been stated for editting my post are lies and in actual fact its probably closer to the truth that Elenchos simply didnt like my anti-Record Industry stance.

You, Potato, can't write worth a damn.  Ergo, your fevered typing has to be edited before it can be presented to a discerning audience.
<BR><BR>
A few spelling mistakes are pardonable.  The occasional omission of an apostrophe or other punctuation can be overlooked.  An incomplete sentence might bear a stylistic purpose, every so often.  Ambiguity might, once in a while, serve to provoke thought.  But to repeat all of these faults relentlessly and without apology amounts to atrocity of the first order.

<BR>

<BR>
Thank you, elenchos [the idiot].  Your stunning disability to let a controversial topic go without your [totally changing] editations reduced this site from what I thought was a serious site with misguided facts to just another comedy show.  At the very least dont give us this "minor edit for accuracy" crap.
<BR>

<BR>
You see, with the way you "edited" the article, you might as well just rewritten the thing.  And the smart aleck remarks about the "uneducated masses [who have more than 3 working brain cells] show just how little resepct you all have for a good dose of reality.
<BR>

<BR>
PotatoError is the only educated poster I have seen on this site.  When the editors [who believe that their opinions are the only ones that matter] stoop so low as to rewrite a well-thought out article such as PE's, it makes me wonder who those "educated [in the school of idiocy] elite" really are.
<BR>

<BR>
In response to another article on this thread, computers were "designed" to do whatever the hell the programmer wants it to do!  That is why they sell programming languages to the "uneducated [(by the idiot school Adequacy's editors went to)] masses" in most computer stores!  Most people want to do something not commercialy packaged, so they learn how to program!  So what if it is a peer-to-peer client: they've been around for a long while.  Also since when was the [perfectly legal] MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 format (commonly known as .MP3) illegal?  I often use it to send original MIDI songs I compose to my friends - I export the song to a .WAV, and encode it.  It does let them here the quality of my synthesizer over theirs.  Notice - ORIGINAL!  Oh my god, elenchos, someone may use it to send their own work out.  For a perfect example, visit www.vgmidi.com and look around in there - there are many MP3s on the site.  AND ALL ARE LEGAL!
<BR>

<BR>
I respect PotatoError for having the guts to put out the article he did, and I spit upon our "big brother," Adequacy's editors, who decide what opinions their underlings should have the right to say [especially if said opinions are true].  If it weren't for crap like this, I wouldn't come here for my daily laughter.  If any of you editor types have the balls to screw with my opinion and post it as my own, or ANYTHING remotely similar [(is open for a debate)], my email address is zekesulastin@yahoo.com, and my AIM SN is "Ezekiel Sulastin" [without the quotes].<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Anyway, that is not the definition of a computer.  What are you on?
<BR><BR>
Hacker's tools are anything that lets the user do things with a machine that the designer had not already thought of and planned for ahead of time.  Some computers can only do one thing.  Others can do many things.  But if a computer can do an <i>undefined</i> number of things, then it is a hackable computer.  It becomes possible to use it as a weapon to hurt the innocent and destroy the Internet.  Regular people don't need hackable computers, because they already know what they will be using them for.
<BR><BR>
They use their PC's for word processing, personal finanace, web browsing and games for example.  These sorts of tasks can be done without an end-user programmable computer, and so only criminals have need of command prompts, ASCII text editors or compilers and interpreters.
<BR><BR>
Those and similar tools belong in the hands of licensed, certified, morally sound professionals only.  Sure the hackers will cry, just as they cry when CD's are made unpiratable, but no one cares about vicious hacker scum and their crocodile tears.
<BR><BR>
Your hacker tools are the equivalent of teflon-coated cop killer bullets.  NAWL, the police and firemen who gave their lives for America on September 11 are HEROES!  They represent the best we have to offer and their noble and brave sacrifice is the living embodiement of our highest ideals!  And you hackers want to give criminals COP KILLER BULLETS???

Someone else may by that high end gaming system for word porcessing because they know they won't have to upgrade for awhile.  Manufacturers don't define a computer's use.

One of the nice properties of tech toys is that even if you legally need a "bumazhka" for handling them, the devices themselves don't ask. Demand drives supply, black market will emerge; personally, mandatory licencing would be a minor hassle for me. Hey - technically I would need certification for quite many things I moonlight in. My results from last 15 years are proof that mandatory licencing of technicians is doomed to effectively fail.
<BR><BR>
<i>Sure the hackers will cry, just as they cry when CD's are made unpiratable, but no one cares about vicious hacker scum and their crocodile tears.</i>
<BR><BR>
There is not an "unpiratable" CD. If it can reach user's ears and/or eyes, it can be copied; this is an axiom. It can be a hassle, but it can be copied. If the Industry violates its own standards - in this case Red Book (and I don't mean the one written by Uncle Mao), they can only expect problems with angry "legitimate" customers, who then often turn to illegal means in order to make an "unprotected" copy that would play on their equipment. Alot of things can be solved by reading the CD with Blindread, and then editing the resulting ISO image before writing it back.
<BR><BR>
<i>Your hacker tools are the equivalent of teflon-coated cop killer bullets.</i>
<BR><BR>
Then they aren't anything especially harmful.
<BR><BR>
The teflon-coated bullets (also called KTW bullets) aren't designed against bulletproof (more accurately, bullet-resistant; bulletproof isn't) vests. Teflon, despite of its smoothness on touch, greatly increases friction when at high speed. The teflon coating was developed to minimize trajectory changes or bouncing when the bullet strikes a surface (like car door, or a window) under an angle. When the KTW bullet collides with a bulletproof vest, it loses more energy on impact (because of friction during penetration of the kevlar layers) than a conventional bullet; the moniker "cop killers" is therefore a misnomer.
<BR><BR>
If you want a real cop-killer bullet, take a conventional one, and aim for head. When I checked last, it was a mission-critical part of human body, and was typically poorly protected. The downside is that it is a bit hard to hit because of relatively smaller size.
<BR><BR>
There are various ways how to shot through armor. The main principle is to use a KP (kinetic penetrator) round. The smaller diameter the bullet has, the higher kinetic energy (mass * velocity^2), and the smaller initial deformation it undergoes at the first microseconds after hitting the target, the better effectivity against bullet-resistant materials. This applies to both kevlar vests and tanks. But no method I heard about ever involved teflon coating. Bullet-resistant vests are good against common handguns; protection they offer against smaller and faster ammo (ie, rifle rounds) is rather limited.
<BR><BR>
So "cop killer" bullets and hacker tools have one thing in common: their danger is vastly overhyped.

The topic is only controversial for Slashdot and Kuro5hin readers and the RIAA. However, Adequacy's editors (and most of the readers too, I expect) aren't interested in the topic. Your article was a competent effort that would have united the readers of the two previously mentioned sites against the RIAA, and had them praising file-sharing networks. But, we get lots of competent articles submitted to us - the truth is that we simply don't care about the subjects of the articles.

You are not the internets most controversial site if all you post is BS. For example with your logic I could post an artical proclaiming to the world that Osama Bin Ladin is George Bushes evil twin. This may not be true however if i posted it and made up some evidence to go along with it then it sure would generate alot of contraversy. The artical presented here about file shareing [the author is a dumbass by using square brackets all the time] clearly presents a one sided view of file sharing. If you boil it all down all that a music file really is, is one very large number ( ones and zeros) which can then be put into decimal and that is it! With the recod and software companies logic i could patent the number 6 A(110) and sue you every time you used the number 6. Boy would i make a fortune off schools who would have to buy liscences to the number 6 from me. And while i'm at it why not 10 (1010 in binary) or 100 (1100100 in binary).

I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT. Ya call me a thief wow I really don't give a shit what you call me i don't really care. The point is that even if it is illegal the FBI is going to have to crack down on like 20 million people. Now 20 million people are illegally downloading music. I will give you 1 million are ignorant of the law (which isn't an exuse but ...) that leaves 19 million people who are downloading music and who really dont give a shit about if it is legal or not. They do this because all thier lives they have payed $20 per CD. They knew they were getting ripped off but there wasn't a way to fight back. Now there is P2P file sharing is changeing the world and the beurocrats are afraid to change with it. They believe that everyone has a few hundred bucks which they can use to accumulate a cd collection. If CD's werent so overpriced in the first place i might actually buy some, however untill they are &lt;$5 apiece (hey that is still &gt;500% profit because a CD costs less than a buck) i won't buy it. The polotics of entertainment have gotten way out of control. Film stars and bands are getting payed millions to do bascially jack. They are demanding more and more because they are whiney little bitches. To compansate the record companies have to hike the costs of CD's. If the record companies make less money then they won't be able to pay as much money to the music stars resulting in a lowered price for everyone :-)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The fact is that a lot of artist get shafted by the record companys and see VERY VERY little of that $20

$5 dollars would not be 500% profit theres quite a lot to makeing a CD equitment, studio time and assload for the company.  the fact is that $15 would be very reasnable for a really god CD.

the thing about file sharing is most people will end up buying a lot more 
<BR>

<BR>
(I know I do, I used to almost never buy CDs but now that its so much easyer to listen and see if I like something. I buy at least 3 times what I did before napster. hearing one track on the radio and then geting a CD with... one good track really makes me not want to buy CDs and that was oftin what stoped me in the past.) 
<BR>

<BR>
...CDs because thay can actualy listen to the music and if its really that good people will buy it because thay want:
<BR>

<BR>
a. more good music from the artists. 
<BR>
b. a nicely designed package with photos and stuff
<BR>
c. thay would want someone to pay them for what thay worked hard on
<BR>

<BR>
what the record companys really don't like about it is that it will make them obsolete people will download what thay want to hear and pay for what is good.

True sharing music helps bands get promotion where Top40 radio programs tend to limit listeners options to say the boy bands and the occasional rap hit, but with the free self promotion that MP3's and the file sharing applications bring you also get freely distributable copy-writed music.  I think Live365.com has the right answer, it lets users make their own radio shows and hosts them, this opens bands up the same way Napster does but also curbs file trading (at least a bit, you can out law it all you want but there is almost no way to enforce or even monitor enough users to ever make a dent)  Should we all just give up and see how MP3's can be made profitable than try to kill them and stick to CDs, probably, but we can't get anywhere until some of us start looking past how people behaved and try to best profit form how they behave right now.

I will note, though, that forensics clubs ought not to be necessary in order for students to acquire the skills of public speaking and reasoning.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I buy CD's, eventhough they're rediculously overpriced (10-20 bucks in Holland, where i live). Musicians do need to be paid, and true artists work their asses off to deliver a good product.
<BR>
BUT on the other hand, there are songs that i download, for several reasons:
<BR>
- It's on an album with just 2 or 3 good songs
<BR>
- It's not available where i live (unless i import it, which makes it about 35 bucks)
<BR>
- I can't afford to buy any CD i want to hear. I love music, but i just buy what's really worth it.
<BR>

<BR>
As long as you keep buying CD's and don't start a business selling pirated material or anything, it's really not going to hurt anybody.
<BR>

<BR>
Pro's:
<BR>
- You can preview CD's without the hassle of being in a crowded noisy musicstore.
<BR>
- You can get rare material, such as B-sides, remixes, and other stuff you won't find in a store.
<BR>

<BR>
Cons:
<BR>
- Some people tend to overdo it a bit.
<BR>
- People like Adequacy.org start whining about it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
