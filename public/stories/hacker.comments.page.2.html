I don't really mean to be like this but if you know enough about html to put a link in a page or at leasy have some poo html site do it for you,  then what your comments have no barring on what "normal" people call reality.
<BR>

<BR>
First and formost all those "hacker" programs you described are called spyware they install with other programs undected by the user. If your beating/grounding your son for that you need a good beating your self. 
<BR>

<BR>
2nd AOL is the biggest piece of poo this side of mars. Gimmie a break about the child saftey, PORN is so rampant on aol it's pathetic. If your son asked you to change isp's and you on aol give him cookie. Aol is poo. it's the slowest service avalible (besides mom and pop local brands) It runs a gui in the back ground that you have to have open to access the net.... Are you Listening A 30 - 100 mb proggie to access the net bite me. Then you have to run whatever pn top of that eg.. game app whatever....
<BR>

<BR>
Plz with the aol. Time warner may have good coyboy filcks but their net is ass all over the usa.Ask why you cant dial in with windows why do you HAVE to use their gui...ok enough with aol but if your grounding you kid cuz he like another isp your the one to blame and if your were this "ideal" parrent you claim to be you'd do more research before posting your insanity on the web and maybe perhaps corupiting more individuals into your beleifs. Which are insane to say the least.(yet again I state this because you apperantly know html).
<BR>

<BR>
If you know nothing/very little about this subject, Dont post you silly I know this is correct cuz I read it somewhere knowledge.
<BR>

<BR>
I rarely if ever respond to something I read on the net , basicaly cuz it doesnt matter. you'll all read this and go hey he's a ass or he's got a ponit ect... this was just so stupid that I had to comment. 
<BR>

<BR>
And if this is some ass just trying to get peoples emails or responses , ya know where ya can go I don't really think anyone is this stupid but hey this may be a ex of mine posting so ya never know:)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I will now outline everything that is wrong with your post.
<BR>

<BR>
1. It takes many years to become a hacker. There are 1,000's of 'Skript Kiddies' that just use other peoples programs to 'hack' into computers. These peolple, usually teenagers, are no real threat to anyone as they have no idea how the program works and will loose intrest very soon when they realise they actually have to KNOW somthing to hack into anything.
<BR>

<BR>
2. AOL's protection is so useless a 3 year old could bypass it.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Commet Cursor and Bonzi Buddy are software that come when you download legitimate programs suck as download managers. They are simply advertisment programs and are certaintly DO NOT have the slightest relationship with anything to do with hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Hardware? Hacking? You can hack with a 5 year old 486 basically as well as with a current model PC. Speed has basically nothing to do with it. ESPECIALLY video cards. Video cards are used for displaying a picture on your screen, how is that going to help you hack?
<BR>

<BR>
5. AMD. AMD is Advanced Micro Devices. They have been round for years and are one of the most respected CPU companies in the world and are on avrage faster that Intel.. Processors dont have 'security features' and if you knew anything about what you were saying you would know that CPU's cant be made in sweat shops because if they get 1 tiny bit of diry on the silicon wafer, they will be useless. They are instead made in factorys that are completely sealed off and people that make them have to wear full body enclosure suits.
<BR>

<BR>
6. Most of those books dont tell children anything about hacking at all! Perl is a programming language and if your son reads more books like that he will have a prosperous career ahead of him.
<BR>

<BR>
7. DoS is a Denial of Service attack. This usually involves sending massive ammouts of data to a web site untill the connection at the other end cannot cope and dies. It dosnt have anything to do with gaining access to there "command prompt!" If you were ever with AOL or a modem service provider you cannot do DoS attacks anyway. You need either an ultra high bandwith conenction (ie T3) or 100's of cable modem connections. Also, DoS attacks usually only last as long as the computers are being attacked for, and have nothing to do with your son being at the computer. 
<BR>

<BR>
8. Quake it an extremly popular online game with 10's of thousands of players. It has ABSOLUBTLY NOTHING AT ALL to do with hacking. I dont even know where you may have gotten that idea from
<BR>

<BR>
9. Firstly, i presume you mean Linux. It is a variation on UNIX, and drives most of the internets web and other servers and was not made by a soviet during the cold war. If linux suddenly didnt exist half the internet woulnd work. Microsoft had nothing at all to do with linux or anything else. Linux is easily removed by deleting the partition it is on and reformating it. It does not damage any part of the computer at all.
<BR>

<BR>
10. How can you hack into a stero system?! MP3 Is a compression format used to compress music into a smaller size so it can be downloaded and distributed. Telnet is mostly outdated now but is a program used to connect to another computer that HAS ENABLED IT and you can do many things, including view web pages with it.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope this has enlightened you on how misinformed you are. Your son is NOT a computer hacker and i suggest you do research before posting information to lead others astray.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash"."
<BR>

<BR>
HAHAHAHA, hilarious. I feel sorry for your son. If this was your proof your wrong.
<BR>
Lets see...
<BR>
Comet Cursor- changes your desktop icon
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy - A very annoying gorilla that sits   
<BR>
on you desktop and makes sounds and reads what you type.
<BR>

<BR>
Flash- Vector graphics for webpages and movies.

Whats with you saying quake is a popular place for hackers to gather? Its a game, it would make more sense for hackers to gather in a chat program like IRC or ICQ. About a kid wanting to change from AOL to another ISP makes perfect sense. AOL sucks, is a ripoff and is slow!
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is an awesome operating system, its flexible and stable. Alot of people want to avoid microsoft too. It doesn't mean a kids a hacker. If anything he's smart for learning a system like that....AND YOU CAN TO UNINSTALL LINUX WITHOUT DAMAGING YOUR HARDRIVE!!!!!!!
<BR>

<BR>
About the Grade's and personal appearance. You can in no way associate that with hacking. Nobody sees you when your on a computer so whats the point. Self expression is not a crime!
<BR>

<BR>
What the hell has wanting new hardware got to do with hacking. AMD processors can be bought anywhere and at any computer store. Processors cannot prevent anyone from hacking. Chances are someone wants to upgrade to increase computer performance for games or for photoshop, lots of RAM and a good video card helps a lot with Photoshop. You can hack just as well on a 486 as you can on a top of the line system.
<BR>

<BR>
30 minutes a day on the computer and your suspicious, what the hell. 
<BR>

<BR>
Just cause your kid knows more about computers than you do doesn't mean he's a hacker. Spend more time doing your research before you jump to conclusions.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope this was a joke, just in case it wasn't I had to write something down

Therefore your "Son" would grow up ignorant and ridiculed by other priviledged children about his ignorance towards the information age.
<BR>

<BR>
    You mentioned that "Linux" and others were "Hacking software" developed by people who have a taste of the disturbance in other peoples belongings, namely Computers.  That opinion, as viewed by me, is second to none the most ignorantly biased opinion I have read about in ages; which is how I view your baseless comments.  If you want your child to learn you would open the doors to knowledge and information about our Age and our surroundings.  In a world that is constantly changing, the conservative in our lives is growing farther and farther outmoded a concept, as the liberal side to ourselves yearns the GROW and not remain stagnant.  You should "research" more about what you talk about in your articles in the future, so that you don't sound like a fool when you want to display an opinion about something that you take an interest in. I say, congratulations to your "Son" for learning something that will prove a valuable asset in the near future of Technology.

All you who bought into the original post, probably think there is a real 'stargate' somewhere in navada after seeing a Stargate SG1 episode on tv. This is just an example of your gullability/stupidity, i dont know which word suits the occasion better. 
<BR>

<BR>
In the original post, every claim made was invalid and infact the truth is the opposite of each claim. Your reference to 'Lunix'(im sure you meant LINUX as it is spelled) is completely inaccurate. LINUX is a wonderful alternative Operating System(OS) to Windows. It is more powerful in every way and thus requires more control and computer/programming knowledge. The truth is that one can hack using any operating system, including windows. 
<BR>

<BR>
There are no tell tale signs if your children are hackers, as i know ones whos age ranges from 10 - 60. The only thing i can think of is that most hackers do find a way to generate extra income to pay for their various expenses, whether this be thru credit card fraud etc, or making legitimate webpages. So if your kids can afford a better car than yours it might be a sign ;) 
<BR>

<BR>
You reference to Quake being a meeting place for hackers could be true, but that is only plausible considering they can meet ANYWHERE. Quake is simply one of the best and first 3d action first person shooter(FPS) games ever to be released. It was hugely popular all over the world with near 10 million gamers worldwide at its peak. You can find out more at http://www.idsoftware.com the home of the creators of the game. 
<BR>

<BR>
I cant really be bothered responding to anything else because the accusations were so completely pathetic, i have just one more thing to say to you parents out there concerned with this matter. 
<BR>

<BR>
I doubt you could stop your children if they were hackers any more than you could if they were shoplifting. Alert the authorities and the threat of severe consequences will most likely be the most effected method of prevention. Changing ISPs, banning computer usage, etc, will do nothing as they will simply find alternative sources for the access required(libraries, schools, internet cafes, etc). 
<BR>

<BR>
Thats about it, and to a|| joo 3l33t haxxz0000rs, dont blame the parents for their ignorance, they grew up tuning cars not staring at a screen as the generation after them did.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I agree with Mr. Gibbons completely.  When my son went to college in another state, I bought him a brand new Gateway computer, built by honest, God-fearing Americans.  In two months time, I recieved a phone call from the campus authorities notifying me that my son had been caught in the act of downloading pornographic images of foreign women using a hacker program called Morpheus.  It should also be noted that <b>Morpheus</b> is the name of a famous hacker in one of the most famous hacker movies of all time, The Matrix.  Is there a coincidence?

This hacking Morpheus program allows hackers to connect to each other using their computers and distribute illegal material such as pornography, stolen MP3s, illegal tapings of newly released films, hacker-compromised versions of common software such as Adobe Photoshop and Instant Messager, which serves as a substitute to face-to-face interaction between hackers.  Fortunately, the people inside the record industry have put an end to the use of this one hacker program, but who is to say there are not a hundred more to take its place?

The hackers then use the items they have collected from Morpheus to attempt larger, more complex hacking of larger, more important systems, sometimes with the intent of bringing business to a halt with denial-of-service attacks.  How is closing down business using a computer any different than using four commercial jet?  How are hackers any different than terrorists?

There is something else to this evil terrorist/hacker hypothesis.  Terrorists in the Middle East may be using hackers here in America, our own sons and daughters, to serve their evil purpose of the destruction of the American Way!  We all have heard on the news of a possible way that Osama bin Laden uses electronic pictures called JPEGs to transmit codes to his operatives worldwide.  The terrorists would have to use some form of decoding the messages as to know where to attack us next.  How would a terrorist, living in a cave or basic city apartment as the ones that attacked the World Trade Center, know how to use the techniques involved to decode messages?  To say that the terrorists decode their own messages is yet another Communist pro-Clinton lie.

There is only one other plausible way for these messages to be decoded, and that is <i>using our own computers fitted with hacker and ex-Soviet technology</i>!  It is a fact that Osama bin Laden fought the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s using American help.  In the defeat of the Red Army, Praise The Lord, bin Laden must have acquired some of their technology, most importantly the Communist operating system <b>Lunix</b>.  They integrated Lunix into stolen American computers and spread it to young, impressionable computer users.  With the supposed simplicity of Lunix, these young people were brainwashed to subconsciously help the terrorists decode the secret messages and pass it along to those who do the Godless deeds.  It all makes perfect and clear sense.

So, it is doubly important in this time of war to identify those who are hackers and save those that are going down the dark, winding path to terrorism.  Furthermore, we should ask George W. Bush, who also is a God-fearing man, to help the people end hacking before another terrible attack like September 11 is allowed to take place.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This is in a published book this is and extract from "Maximum Security: 
<BR>
A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Internet Site and Network"
<BR>
 A hacker is a person intensely interested in the arcane and recondite workings of any computer operating system. Most often, hackers are programmers. As such, hackers obtain advanced knowledge of operating systems and programming languages. They may know of holes within systems and the reasons for such holes. Hackers constantly seek further knowledge, freely share what they have discovered, and never, ever intentionally damage data.
<BR>

<BR>
A cracker is a person who breaks into or otherwise violates the system integrity of remote machines, with malicious intent. Crackers, having gained unauthorized access, destroy vital data, deny legitimate users service, or basically cause problems for their targets. Crackers can easily be identified because their actions are malicious. 
<BR>

<BR>
Im 16 have my own computer a AMD 1000 now can you get this word "Overclocked" to 1200 mhz Hences the AMD 1000 is running at AMD 1200.I could be a hacker i guess already i use AMD. Oh wait my marks have increased with the aid of a computer i can now type them up also do research on the internet. This also takes longer then 30 mins to do this i guess that means im DOS (Denial of Service) someone i think not i have a 56k modem i would be lucky to beable to DOS my self most DOSing has to be done over a high speed line. Also if the firewall on the DOS computer or network was configed correctly this DOS would not be a problem. 
<BR>
I use BSD and i have also used linux that i guess also makes me a hacker becasue they are free?? No they are opensource meaning many people can see the source code and modify the OS so that it can be more user friendly and also make it so "Firewalls" can work better. 
<BR>

<BR>
They only reason you dont seem to like Linyos Torovoltos is that he is russian. If he was a American like yourself he would be prased as a hero "Oh this guy has created a wonderfull os to get russia". Im a aussie and i will be damned if i get called what you mean a cracker. If you call me a hacker i will say thankyou and ask what do you need help with on your computer.
<BR>

<BR>
Sidenote: I am writing this using Windows NT because it supports other functions which i can not use in linux.

The likelihood that a single individual would A)Be that knowledgeable of commercial items pertaining to the use of a couputer yet still B) be as clueless as to think that the 35 Million machines running a version of Linux today are purely the tools of hackers.

I will give you that my initial response to your article was one of mixed disbelief and rage... but if you are indeed serious, then I have some advice and prayers that need to go your way.

First of all, protecting your children is admirable.  Let me commend you on that point, many children could use much more hands-on parenting than they get.  However, good parenting involves much more than just sheltering your child from any bad influences.  Maintaining and allowing ignorance / misinformation to exist in the mind of your child will only bring about your worst nightmare... I can tell you first hand.

I was raised in an extremely strict Christian household - no Rock music, no parties, no... well it really pretty much covered anything.  Did this change my attitude toward the things I encountered when I was 18?  Yes it did... starting with moving out the day I turned that magic number.  I spent less than 24hrs looking for, and then trying Pot and LSD... (and later a few more 'exotic' substances - which I have to say were everything and more that I'd built them up to be.  I haven't done anything other than coffee and cigarettes for about 10 years, but an IT Consulting business will do that for you.

The key here is in what my parents did <i>right</i> in raising me... they taught me to always seek knowledge and to temper that knowledge with right and wrong... they bought me my first computer at 12 and I bought the next 40 or 50 computers over the next 18 years... WITH THE MONEY I EARNED USING THEM.  Yes that's right my good man... by your standards I am the most insidious form of life on the planet (except from reading some of your other offerings here... followers of Islam?).  I am a hacker.  Now I would never call myself that term... I have an education.  And true I've hacked through firewalls and exploited security inadequacies in machines running Windows, Linux (the devil's OS? HeHe), and MacOS - I have only done so to my own systems or those of my clients to test and prevent any malicious mischief on critical data systems.  So go ahead, treat your son like a criminal for expanding his knowledge... you certainly wouldn't want him to be able to have skills that would make him useful and successful in the future... I'm sure he'll make a fine mechanic... Unless there is just as much of a problem with 'grease-monkeys' as there are with 'hackers'.  BTW I assume that you use AOL... which has to be the A#1 easiest system to spoof and exploit - If your son was a real hacker he would want you to stick with AOL... if you do things right there is absolutely no way they would ever be able to find out... food for thought... and I'll be praying for your son... I think it may be too late for you, but maybe we're both wrong!

These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites.

Ail will mame you're computer. It will slow it down. Cause it to crash. And allot of other problems. It rips out the Tcp/ip stack and it never works right again unless you format and Reinstall windows. It also costs more then a real sip. And is allot slower. 
<BR>

<BR>
"Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>

<BR>
The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding. 
<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
Flash is a programming language that is used to make animations and movies. Large sites like Fords, Apples, Dodges, Toyotas, and many others use it.
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi is like a version of tamagotchi, its no more for hackers then that is! 
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is just a replacement for how the curser looks.

"Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.

Video cards: to improve how the screen looks. And the Quality and Performance of video intensive programs. It also helps reduce eyestrain.

<BR>
Hard drives: To keep more things on the computer.

Ram (memory): to load more then one thing at once so that windows does not grind to a halt when it try's to load to many things.

"Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behavior at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school. 
<BR>

<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is old. Any one still playing quake is not doing that. They are just playing for fun. There are not hackers plotting to take over the world. 
<BR>

<BR>
The avg age for playing games like quake? 27years of age. More adults play games like that then kids do. Again you are just plain wrong. 
<BR>

<BR>
"BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface. 
<BR>

<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
BSD is not Linux. I have no idea what Lunix is. But Linux is made by Linus Torvalds Not some "Soviet computer hacker" 
<BR>

<BR>
No clue what "xenix" is. That site looks to be nothing more then a joke. Making you look worse. 
<BR>

<BR>
"If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. 
<BR>

<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
That's called growing up. Nothing to do with being on a computer. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases. Also, the reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight. For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically. 
<BR>

<BR>
I encourage all parents to read through this guide carefully. Your child's future may depend upon it. Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison, and tear your family 
<BR>
"
<BR>

<BR>
Far from the truth. Computers improve the problem solving skills. Hand eye cord and other useful things in those who learn them.

First of all Quake is a GAME. That's ALL. It's perhaps not of the most uplifting type... as it is a first person shooter, however it does not "Train in the use of firearms" as all you have to do to shoot in the game is push a mouse button. I doubt anyone who plays this game would develop extensive weapons skills from it. 
<BR>
Pure absurdity.
<BR>
And by the way, Linux (Spelled correctly) is NOT illegal, it is a free operating system that more than HALF of the internet is hosted on. It is more stable than most other platforms, and is purely a superior OS. 
<BR>

<BR>
You people should really find better things to do with your time... I must say if you actually parent your children in a fashion like this you are going to make them hate you. No kid wants to live in a freaking dictatorship where his/her every move is watched.
<BR>

<BR>
I happened to get into using Linux/unix a few years back, and it has proved most helpful in getting me several job advancements in the IT (information/technology) field.

I almost laughed out loud when I read that "Bonzi Buddy" was supposed to be hacker software! He's just a little green parrot which can learn how to type. Boycotting any old download won't make your son very appreciative will it?
<BR>

<BR>
Hackers DO NOT wear day-glo. Least none I know of. I won't even touch on the difference bewteen hackers and crackers to save those grey cells.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is NOT hacker software. It is an operating system much like Windows. The only difference being that it is open source and therefore customisable to the extremes.
<BR>

<BR>
Behaviour is zero indication of whether your son/daughter is a hacker. There could be many reasons for it. A lot of hackers are just like you and I, you wouldn't even notice a change in deodourant.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is merely a computer game where you battle against virtual opponents. There is no firearm training. You just grab a rocket launcher and fire bolts of fire at your opponents. Just like Goldeneye on the N64, only better.
<BR>

<BR>
Asking for new hardware or software may just mean your son needs an upgrade to play the latest games.
<BR>

Video Cards are simply for graphics you goof..... deny you son a video card of all things. Did you know better video cards allow for more advanced Art programs such as Adobe Photohop... and more ram helps the program run faster.

Linux is a version of Unix the two operating systems are so similar its mind boggling. What the hell do you think your phone company uses to run such a massive Data Base..... windows???... Unix has been around for more than 20 years... Linux is just an offspring of that you moron. In fact Linux is a more secure operating system than windows will ever be..... it has to be its been around 4 times longer which means its completely refined. More than that Linux/Unix will run 10 times faster than windows on the same computer....
<BR>
The biggest and best Web sites all run on some form of linux or unix... if they didnt they wouldnt last long trust me.

AOL is a joke BTW your computer is probabaly so full of spyware its not even funny.... and you think AOL is the way to go... hell they prolly know everything about your family if yer using it for banking etc etc etc.

If your so worried about your son hacking take your computer throw it out off the balcony pack up and move to hillbillyville.

BTW did you know your car has a computer in it..... god forbid if he HACKED the PLANET with you car.....

Your stupidity is unbelievable and unwarranted. Your ignorance is even worse. When i spend everyday just learning about computers for a living you think in a matter of 2 or 3 days YOU (of all people on this planet) have the answer to your sons hacking...... which he probably isnt even doing. 
<BR>

<BR>
And lastly Quake is a game of pure skill ..... the hand eye corrodination required to play a game like that has nothing to do with hacking. Jesus the US military uses games to train 90% of their forces...... and OH just so you know those simulators arn't using some piece of shit video card LOL

Flash is a vector animation program. It is used to make everyting from online cartoons, web page animations, and even web based games. Far from hacking as Adobe Photoshop!

Linux is also one of the only OSs that will allow you to use huge ammounts of RAM. That would help with his gaming as well as any program on the computer.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Firstly, I will say this: I do not agree with practically any points in this article. However, looking down the list, I see many people who have fallen to the use of foul language, insulting, and really making absolute jerks of themselves. It's not on, and I won't fall to that level. However, there are some things in this article that should be brought to your attention. Errors not in opinion, as opinion is held by the one who owns it, but rather pure errors in basic fact. I will disect this article piece by piece.
<BR>

<BR>
Firstly, let me say, I am a 17 year old Australian teenage male. I have a lifetime of experience wiht computers, of many hours most dats, and, yes, in the past, even hacking. Something I'm not too proud of, but I suppose we all do things in life that we regret. I'm not a parent, so perhaps one could argue my opinion is voided by my lack of a parenting experience. Hear me out, though. I think you'll find what I have to say makes a lot of sense.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;As an enlightened, modern parent, I try to be as involved as possible in the lives of my six children. I encourage them to join team sports. I attend their teen parties with them to ensure no drinking or alcohol is on the premises. I keep a fatherly eye on the CDs they listen to and the shows they watch, the company they keep and the books they read. You could say I'm a model parent. My children have never failed to make me proud, and I can say without the slightest embellishment that I have the finest family in the USA. &lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
It's good to see you take an active interest in your children's activities. My parents always have with me, and I believe I've matured greatly because of that. However, my parents have also learnt when to let me experience what I will and learn from it. I have never touched alcohol or drugs, though I have been in situations where I have been offered these many times without any support (ie everybody else around me, including friends, will be taking these drugs and/or drinking the alcohol) and my parents have not had to be there to hold my hand. They know they can't be there for me forever, and I've learnt to make my own, and the right, decisions.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;Two years ago, my wife Carol and I decided that our children's education would not be complete without some grounding in modern computers. To this end, we bought our children a brand new Compaq to learn with. The kids had a lot of fun using the handful of application programs we'd bought, such as Adobe's Photoshop and Microsoft's Word, and my wife and I were pleased that our gift was received so well. Our son Peter was most entranced by the device, and became quite a pro at surfing the net. When Peter began to spend whole days on the machine, I became concerned, but Carol advised me to calm down, and that it was only a passing phase. I was content to bow to her experience as a mother, until our youngest daughter, Cindy, charged into the living room one night to blurt out: "Peter is a computer hacker!"  
<BR>

<BR>
As you can imagine, I was amazed. A computer hacker in my own house! I began to monitor my son's habits, to make certain that Cindy wasn't just telling stories, as she is prone to doing at times. 
<BR>

<BR>
After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking, I confronted Peter with the evidence. I'm afraid to say, this was the only time I have ever been truly disappointed in one of my children. We raised them to be honest and to have integrity, and Peter betrayed the principles we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities. His denials continued for hours, and in the end, I was left with no choice but to ban him from using the computer until he is old enough to be responsible for his actions.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
As I will outline later in this article, perhaps your claims that your child is a computer hacker are indeed false, and your child was telling the truth. Nothing jades a teenager like what they intepret as injustice. It is deep inbuilt in a teenager's psyche to rebel not necessarily against authority, but rahter injustice. (Many teenagers simply confuse the two, which is a pity)
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;After going through this ordeal with my own family, I was left pondering how I could best help others in similar situations. I'd gained a lot of knowledge over those few days regarding hackers. It's only right that I provide that information to other parents, in the hope that they will be able to tell if their children are being drawn into the world of hacking. Perhaps other parents will be able to steer their sons back onto the straight and narrow before read this list carefully and if their son matches the profile, they should take action. A smart parent will first try to reason with their son, before resorting to groundings, or even spanking. I pride myself that I have never had to spank a child, and I hope this guide will help other parents to put a halt to their son's misbehaviour before a spanking becomes necessary.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
A fair enough purpose, and perhaps even an admirable one. However, it is unfortuante that you are not quite as knowledgable on this subject as you think you are. I mean that in a very non-provocative way, but it is the truth.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Firstly, there are many respectable ISP's besides AOL. In my rather wide experience on the Internet, AOL has an extremely large proportion of hackers, as their hack-preventing software is extremely easy to get around. I am only repeating this as second-hand information, however, as I have never used AOL personally. I have, however, used SENet, one of Australia's top ISP, and also Telstra, which is the only option for an Internet broadband cable modem in my state. And whilst neither of these two services offer child protection facilities, they do advise that you is possible to download software such as Net Nanny to protect your children from this. Though, once again, if they never learn for themselves, how can they be expected to fully mature and develop into adults? 
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>

<BR>
The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Is it a crime to install programs on one's computer? Your son may wish to install programs such as games or other such software which is harmless. Your common hacking software isn't exactly quite correct. I've never heard of Comet Cursor in my life, and I've been using the Internet for years. Bonzi Buddy is indeed an irritating program, but not hacking software. The bonzi buddy is used to remember your passwords so you don't have to type them repeatedly. It has no hacking facilities whatsoever. Flash is a graphical animation program and also has absolutely no hacking facilities whatsoever. Yes, there are hacking programs around, such as Back Orifice, and Nethack. But your kid will find other ways to hide this software than the Add/Remove programs tab.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
As your pointed out, your kid may have a viable reason for requesting new hardware. As new and better programming languages are released, they require newer and better hardware to run them. The programming language Java, created by Sun, is a perfect example. Java is fast becoming the most popular language for programming companies around the world, but it is rather slow, and requires a hefty computer to run to it's full capacity. In this day and age in Australia, a top of the range computer is outdated in 6 months time, and I hear it's even quicker over there in America.
<BR>

<BR>
Secondly, an AMD chipset is not a cheap third-world based knock up chip at all! The AMD chipset is every bit as professionally made as Intel, and many computer professionals believe even more so. It is certainly not designed for hackers, and these hacking-preventing security features you say that Intel chips have don't exist. On ANY chip. My family runs a computer business from home here as a second job, and we've sold many AMD chips, which have worked every bit as well as Intel chips. An AMD chip will not help your son hack any bit more than an Intel chip will.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds. 
<BR>

<BR>
There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you find any of these hacking manuals in your child's possession, confiscate them immediately. You should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves. You may meet with some resistance at first, but even booksellers have to bow to community pressure.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Well, yes, if your son is reading hacking manuals, that's probably a good sign he's interested in hacking. However, you could do well to read a couple of your hackers books. An example is "Programming in Perl". Perl is arguably the most ingenious language ever designed for Internet use, and it's use in the professional computer world is immensely widespread. Your kid could be reading it because he's interested in pursuing a career in computer programming, as am I. I've read a few books on programming (though not specifically Perl) and I'm practising all the time using Java and HTML. Not because I want to hack, but rather becuase I want to program.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
With all due respect, half an hour a day is an absolute joke. Simply researching a school project can take a few hours, or more for an inexperienced Internet user. I use the computer many hours per day, and I am an extremely well adjusted kid. I know many more like me. Also, this DOSing as you describe it does not exist. DOS is an acronym for Disk Operating System and it was the most popular (though not necessarily the best) operating system before Microsoft released Windows 95 and it's subsequent follow-on's. I think I know what you may be referring to, which is simply a hacking program that you run in DOS, but these are generally less dangerous to the hackers target than one run in Window's anyway.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is a game. Hopefully your son is well adjusted enough to tell the difference between fantasy and reality. I certainly can, and have been able to for as long as I remember. And in my limited experience in Quake (the game bored me, quite frankly) - most of the players there aren't interested in guns in the slightest, more just the thrill of a fast-paced competition. Sort of like people who like to play Paintball skirmish aren't interested in guns, but more a fun game with their friends.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, games such as Quake (which is a bad example, anyway. Far more explicit and graphic games exist, but poor Quake and Doom are always the games examplified because the world knows the names) really give no knowledge on firing a gun. You push a button and the weapon fires. The kid doesn't experience the kick-back, the kid doesn't do anything about loading the weapon, or anything. I can quite safely say I don't know how to fire a gun,and have no desire to. Those school shootings that have been widely publicised were far more likely caused by maladjusted kids that were going to do it anyway. For a parent not to notice that the kids had their own weapons shows a sever lack of nurturing and care on the parent's behalf, and it is simply easier for a family and a community in general to blame a harmless game than to take the brunt of the fault themselves.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in. Keep trying to get through to him, no matter how much he retreats into himself. &lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
When a child reaches puberty, their hormones and emotions are changed. This can result in chemical imbalances causing depression, anger, fear, rebelliousness, and the like. This has been hapenning for all of recorded history, and probably longer. It has nothing to do with hacking. And whilst parents do mean the best for their kids, they must also learn to understand the fact that they do not always know how to help their kid. The kid will only learn for himself via his own mistakes. In fact, if they're not pressured to be a certain why by their parents, teenagers are often willing to travel that path by themselves.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
I'll presume by Lunix you mean Linux, one of the best operating systems around for computer programmers and home users alike. Linux is an open-source (that means that it is free for people to download) operating system built on Unix. Unix was not developed by some Soviet computer hacker like you described, but rather by a company were writing a computer game, the name of which escapes me at the moment. I think it was "Space Adventure" or something. They decided that there were no operating systems that could handle their game, so they went about programming their own operating system for it, which they called "Multichs". Eventually, the project was canned, and the financial support removed. A couple of the programmers wanted to see their dream a reality, however, so they continued to produce the operating system, calling it "Eunuchs", a pun on it's original name, and about how their funds were "cut off" from under them. Eventually, the original funders could see the operating system was going to work well after all, and released it, but as "Eunuchs" wasn't an appealing name, it was changed to "Unix". Linux was built on top of it. People tend to like Linux because it is more stable than Windows and works better, with less crashes. ALso, some programs will only work on Linux. It is also a better operating system for the budding programmer to learn his skills on.
<BR>

<BR>
Xenix is actaully Xenox, and whilst it escapes me who produced this, it was not Microsoft. Xenox was designed for the office user, but was not widely successful due to it's unwiedly User Interface. It was, however, the first Graphical User Interface, and was copied by Apple Macintosh's OS, and Microsoft's Window's series, not by Linux or Unix.
<BR>

<BR>
LILO is nothing to do with Linux. It is an acronym for "Last in Last out", and is the same thing as FIFO (First in First out), if memory serves. LILO is a way of handling your computer's information. For example, if you try to open up Microsoft Word and Microsoft Internet Explorer at the same time, LILO will handle how these two tasks are done to make it appear simultaneous. I assure you this is nothing to do with Linux.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Actually, in my experience, most hackers dress the complete opposite to this. I believe you're referring to what we in Australia like to call a "surfy", and whilst they can be annoying, they're rather harmless. And, also in my experience, surfy's tend to be the complete opposite to hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases. Also, the reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight. For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
Firstly, most computer hackers tend to be rather intelligent, as it requires quite a bit of brainpower to understand how it works. Especialyl in mathematics. So this is unlikely to be a true sign. As for EM Radiation, you should hire one of those devices that allows you to measure the amount of radiation emitted in a certain area. The radiation emitted from standing 10 metres from your microwave is at least twenty times that emitted from your monitor. As for muslce depletion, that is unlikely to be caused by someone spending too long on the computer. Gaining body weight is possible, I suppose, but then again it's also possible for many other reasons.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;I&gt;I encourage all parents to read through this guide carefully. Your child's future may depend upon it. Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison, and tear your family apart. It cannot be taken too seriously.&lt;/I&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
This is true. However, the rest of the article is not.
<BR>

<BR>
I hope you read this and consider what I say. Your child may be innocent of his supposed crime of computer hacking, and at the very least you will have learnt more. Hopefully this article also goes to show that it is possible for a teenager to spend many hours a day on the computer and still be a decent person.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
I am honestly scared to death by the fact that there are people believing i this, and that they are spreading the misinformation on.
<BR>
(note: exuse my imperfect english, Im from sweden its not my first language)
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
First of all I will tell you how to know if your child is a hacker:
<BR>

<BR>
YOU WONT!!!!!
<BR>
hacking demands skill and knowledge.
<BR>
your son will learn how to avoid discovery long before he gets even near beeing able to "hack"
<BR>

<BR>
you say you got your information from books?
<BR>
hell I thought publishers actually read the stuff before printing, Im having a hard time believing that you could get that kind of TOTAL BLASPHEMOUS MIS-INFORMATION from people that arent either mentally ill or laughing at you when you leave.
<BR>

<BR>
I have spent a lot of time on the interet, I have 2 computers in my room, one workstation with windows and a server with linux. I have an AMD cpu, and a fast graphics card. I have begged my pareents for new hardware many a time until i was able to begin upgrading my box with my own money, and I spend my spare time in front of the computer.
<BR>
I use most of the programs you said indicated hacking, exept for those I have deemed worthless.
<BR>

<BR>
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO HACK!!!!
<BR>

<BR>
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CRACK A PROGRAM!!!!
<BR>

<BR>
the author of the article can be quite calm, cause his son dont know jack shit about hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
Next issue is about Linux, and the misinformation written in the article and some replies is terrible.
<BR>
Linux was created by Linus Torvalds, born in Finland and currently working in a perfectly legal software company in silicon valley.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is based on UNIX wich was created far before Microsoft came into the picture.
<BR>

<BR>
Lilo is a utility that enables you to install both linux and windows on one computer, and lets you choose wich to use at startup.
<BR>

<BR>
What the above article shows is not concern for children, but rather a terrible paranoia and fear of computers. I your son spends time in front of the computer, if your son does things on it that you cant understand, and if he uses all these things you associate with hacking... rejoice!!
<BR>
all those computer millionaires like Gates began that way. 
<BR>
How to work with computers isnt anything you learn at scool. sure there is that kind of scools but they can only teach you so much. even if you graduate with flying colours from such a school you wont have a chance against the other guy who spent as much time at home teaching himself, just for the fun of it.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
finally: 
<BR>
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP BEEING SO AFRAID!!!
<BR>
hackers live everywhere around you, you see them every day, but they have ordinary families, they have ordinary jobs, and live in ordinary houses.
<BR>
_they are not dangerous_
<BR>

<BR>
the claims from the software and music industries that so and so many million dollars are lost due to piracy/cracking/hacking are utterly ridiculous.
<BR>
They calculate their numberts from that fact that every copied game, application and song would be bought if it was not freely availabe.
<BR>
the industry cannot be that stupid, i refuse to believe that they could be in their position without uderstanding that only about 0.1-0.01 percent of the downloaded apps would have been bought at the ridiculous rates the industry sets today.

In order to print newspapers or magazines they use computers. And if you are right even the bible was made with the use of computers.
<BR>
I hope that you know that whenever you buy a bible or anything else that are printed you are giving hackers more money so that they can build even moore powerful hacking tools.

<BR>

<BR>
Firstly, maybe the new isp is BETTER AND FASTER.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?
<BR>

<BR>
Either the stupid parents have been accepting virus's in outlook or they could be simple addons for Adobe Photoshop and other word processing tools.
<BR>

<BR>
Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". &lt;=== MWAHAHHAHA
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware?
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is a damn good chip, maybe your son has been given vcd's and dvd's to watch on the computer fool.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals?
<BR>

<BR>
Those books are hardly manuals just stories of arrests. Btw whats wrong with learning Perl programming lanuage. Your one of those parents "
<BR>
Do as i say, say as i don't".
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?
<BR>

<BR>
30mins? What if their doing school assignments and playing Doom2 and not quake. My parents can spend up to 4+ hrs and more on here, does this mean they are 31337 h4x0rz?
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
MWAHAHA I play plenty of quake, go into quake ask a hacking question and recieve a bunch of blanks faces. Quake is a fun game just because its violent dosn't mean their training to use weaponary, it takes countless hours to learn how to use weapons effectively.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?
<BR>

<BR>
Ever thought that he might be growing up, no longer wanting you to walk all over him?
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
A powerful Operating System, use it and say goodbye to Windows memory leaks, blue screens and crashes also its 10x faster. Your argument in this area makes me laugh.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
He dresses normally, ever thought he dresses like a raver? Or was it "Checked shirt, jeans and white socks" in your time?.
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically?
<BR>

<BR>
Could be he's not as mature as his peers, and you said maths and chemistry. There are people who are better at Science and Maths and others better and English and the Arts. Ever think of that?

I do, however, have some additions to make on this subject.  Along with such "hacker manuals" as "Programming Perl", I would highly recommend confiscating any literature by the deviant author known as Dr. Seuss.  This is but a nickname for a man named Theodor Geisel, hackers often use such nicknames.  Along the lines of games to be wary of, I would certainly be very skeptical about games like "Mario Kart" for the Nintendo 64, this is another virtual reality for hackers to submerse themselves in in order to learn to drive go-karts recklessly.  Perhaps the things you should be most aware of, as T. Reginald Gibbons has warned us, is software. Along with such programs as Flash and Comet Cursor, you should IMMEDIATELY delete Minesweeper and Solitaire.  These vicious programs can be used to gain access to both fun and entertainment, something every parent should be aware of at all times.

If you think the game Quake will cause your kid to shoot you, might i suggest locking your kid up in a cage for the rest of his life, because the day to day images and language in the most "un-explicit" lifestyle is going to be far worse than a computer game of monsters or robots shooting each other.

<BR>

<BR>
AMD is available in every retail store i know, and they are an upmarket competitor to intel, they are NOT a hacking company.
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps you just tried researching hacking because you were concerned for your kid, and you read some stupid site which you got all your information from, this is called ignorance.  The time you spent putting all those links in your original post surely indicates enough dedication to at least research what linux is used for....or maybe at least how to spell it.

Flash, is an ever popular, honest, application for animations.  I bet you cant visit your local gardening show website without installing flash.

I've had to upgrade my friend's computer from compaq components and all of the compaq components are the worst in his new machine I built him.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
The realaity about these "Hacker" tips:
<BR>
=========================================
<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs?
<BR>

<BR>
First of all, anyone using AOL is prone to excessive advertising, slow login speeds, and just bad access all together.  There are SEVERAL ISPs that are more respectable than AOL.  I would be more concerned with your son if he DIDN'T want to switch ISPs.  If youre concern is blocking content, download a utility called Net Nanny.  It blocks all kind of specifiable information/content.  You can also use Internet Explorer's built in content restriction - however it is more limited in its filtering.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?
<BR>

<BR>
"Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". "  ---HAHAHAHAHA  OH wow.  Comet cursor simply changes the mouse's cursor image when at sites that have that feature built in.  There are rumors about comet cursor being spy ware.  Go look that up before you start saying that it is teh devil or something lame like that.  Flash is an interactive extension of Internet Explorer.  There are several sites that REQUIRE flash be installed to run.  Some site's menus, images, sound, etc use flash to work.  How you could mistaken these applications as 'hacking software' is amazing to me and the rest of the world.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware?
<BR>

<BR>
If I ever bought a compaq, I'd also demand new hardware.  These 'computers' are the cheapest things ever built.  New hardware - such as RAM, hard drives, graphic cards, sound cards, network cards, etc...  These have to do with upgrading performance.  If I were to get a game, it would most likely run horrible on a compaq because of its built on cheap integrated sound/gfx chips.
<BR>

<BR>
As for AMD.  AMD processors are alot cheaper than Intel ones, and on almost every benchmark they out-perform Intel.  They are the best in multimedia rich content, gamming, and just about every use - with the exception of data/application compiling.  I have an AMD 1.4 GHz Thunderbird which I overclocked to 1.6 GHz.  I love AMD because it allows you to do that. More value for your dollar.  Plus I don't like those Intel commercials :D
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
This may be the only real concern to look at.  However it can also be of use to you.  I'm in the Cisco Academy program year 2, and they teach us hacking information.  Not the "I'm going to shut down your site" sutff, but security on switches/routers.  This is not for malicious use, it is for an understanding of how to secure yourself better, while understanding what is happening.  And if the manuals your child reads if about Internet Security or in any way goes over protection - I'd recommend you let him/her be.  They are most likely learning valuable skills which could apply to the computer industry while protecting your data from REAL hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?
<BR>

<BR>
Since youre using AOL - 56K most likely - 'DOSing' someone would not really do anything but slow your connection down alot.  You have to understand more about how and what you are actually doing if you were to DOS someone.  The most common way is to attack someone with the "ping" command.  This is not illegal.  This is a built in function of the internet known as ICMP.  It is for checking up status of servers, packet trip time, etc.  Your bandwidth isnt enough to even touch anything because you have to recieve a reply for every packet you send.  And since a 56kbps connection is that slow - actually limited to 46kbps-48kbps because of modem ability, line speed, and government laws, you wouldn't be able to do any damage unless you coordinated an attack with many people.
<BR>

<BR>
And the command prompt is not a threatening program.  It is the basic core behind the Windows 3.xx, Windows 95/98/me operating systems.  If he/she is playing around in there that is a good thing.  There are college classes that teach people how to move and do things in there.  Think of this as a savings in tuitions of your son/daughter is planning on going in to computers.
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake?
<BR>

<BR>
First off, the assumption of Quake being a hacker game/meeting place is totally unwarranted.  Quake is a very old game that isn't worth playing.  However it may be the only game that runs on that compaq.  It would be more likely for 'hackers' to meet on IRC than on Quake being that IRC is a chat protocol which has several programs written for it.  However, IRC is not only a hacker tool.  It is a communication program.  Since you use AOL, I'd put it like this:  IRC is like AIM.  It is where people would meet and talk.  If youre going to start accusing things, you should acuse AIM since it is just as 'dangerous'.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
This isnt a hacker trait - this is a person who uses any computer trait.  Some questioning of authority is normal - especially for teens.  I know since I am one.  Rather than banning him/her from the computer, I'd recommend that you limit the time that they spend on the computer.  I myself was banned in the 7th grade from teh computer until 9th grade.  My parents thought it would be a good thing.  All this encouraged me to do as get involved with the wrong crowd.  My freshman year's grades were suffering because of being around the wrong people.  Plus the computer is my tool for letting out anger in games and having fun.  I also create several things on it allowing me to show my ideas.  The second I got my computer back, I left that crowd to return to my computer ways - which has resulted in a 3.5 - 4.0 grade change from 2.0.  Computers can be as inspiring as they can be angering.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
It is actually called Linux.  This is a free OS that you can modify yourself to make it do anything you wish.  It is not some hacker program.  IBM - a very highly respectable company is selling Linux servers.  Why Linux?  It uses memory very efficiently while also being stable.  This also allows for the customer to modify the OS's features for better functionality.
<BR>

<BR>
MP3 is simply Mpeg Layer 3. It is a file that uses encoding/decoding (codec) to reproduce sound.  Just like wave files.  Except MP3's are highly compressed making them take up less HDD space.
<BR>

<BR>
As for Telnet: Telnet is a program for remote terminal control of a server.  Is it used for administration purposes.  Besides being a legit tool included with windows, it can be used for hacking computer servers - not "which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone"...  However, the server has to be configured for telnet access, and they have passwords on them.  With your connection, hacking a telnet server's password would take weeks... and by then it would probably be changed.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
Well I agree that this looks stupid, but it more likely has to do with drug-related crowds than hacking.  If they simply dyed their hair, it is no major thing.  That is common in today's society.
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
By over-using the computer, the priorities may become misplaced, but that doesnt mean that they are a hacker.  You should probably reduce - NOT BAN - your child's computer usage.  Verify and help them if they need help with homework rather than blame the comptuer as my parents did.
<BR>

<BR>
=====================================
<BR>

<BR>
In a computer and technology using society, it is common for people who do not know anything about computers to blame them or the person doing something.
<BR>

<BR>
I was accused of 'hacking' when at my school's library on a computer by the librarian.  I was writing HTML web content for the school's web site.  Because of that person's assumptions, I involved the vice-principal so could get back to work.  Instead of fearing technology, why don't YOU learn something about it rather than accuse people who are doing things for good.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hello, my name is Ori Klein, I'm a 20 years old male from Israel, and I've been around the computers community for a very long time (since I was a little child myself).
<BR>

<BR>
I will try to go out of my nature, be proffessional, kind, use proper english (as much as I can, I am Israeli after all and my 1st language is hebrew so bear with my bad grammar with grace ;)) and try to explain to you why you are so wrong step by step.
<BR>

<BR>
Let's begin with your first point.
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
AOL is notorious for being easy to work with, for hackers.
<BR>
Many games have the entire AOL provider IP banned.
<BR>
Their security is easy to bypass, their services are a shame and their protection is near to non existant, I don't know if they're just cheap to invest into proper measures and development/upgradings.
<BR>
As said, the reason most like to NOT work with AOL, and why a child would ask his parents to change to another ISP is becouse their service, connection speed wise, is...well...derogatory and a disgrace.
<BR>
Even my Israeli ISP which you could easily reffer to as very lousy, provides better connection across the ocean, than AOL which are merely few hundred miles from the Internet main operator.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>

<BR>
The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
I don't know where you are getting your information from, but you should demand a refund.
<BR>
Comet Cursor, although uses some functions that might be persived as intrusive to YOUR OWN system, is not a hacker program, I.E. you won't be using it to hack someone else.
<BR>
All it do is allow you to change the image of the mouse cursor, instead of that dismal arrow sign Microsoft provides.
<BR>
And for setting it in your website, that when one entering it, again, the mouse image is changed just for when the mouse is over that website (just like most games that use the mouse have it change into an image of their own choosing for theme purposes).
<BR>

<BR>
Macromedia Flash (previously known as shockwave) is a graphical program helping non-artistical persons to easily create fabulous proffesional looking animations.
<BR>
As well as using many triggers, which allow rookies creating a proffesional looking website.
<BR>
For a demonstration, go visit http://www.2design.org, this is a site of a one who has created many proffesional websites, and the site lovly intro itself is made in Flash.
<BR>
Click the "webwork" button, then the "flash" one below it, then choose one of the lovly websites they've created using flash.
<BR>
Another nicly flashed site is http://www.mainframe.ca/mainframe.html?flashed&none
<BR>
.
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, the control panel can easily be bypassed and have its content deleted.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
Many softwares, especially those of the graphical nature (graphic creation tools and namly mainly games) have VERY high requirements.
<BR>
I for one am a draughtsman and uses AutoCad 2002, 3D studio max and many of the kind and without a high hardware to support it, certain proccesses (especially 3D renderings, isometric views with full details such color, etc.) might take a VERY long time for the computer to finish, and that's, at the least (and in the prettiest language form) very intterupting to my work.
<BR>
Not to mention, the aforementioned games, are rapidly developing in tech, and so, their requirements can go sky high, and the more time passes the higher those requirements are (There are hardly any "worthy" games that can work without a high performance graphical card such as Voodoo, Gforce, etc. not to mention CPU power).
<BR>

<BR>
As for AMD...
<BR>
I'll take a wild guess that you've read and been mislead by pro-Intel propoganda.
<BR>
There's a constant on-going race to develop higher-preformance faster CPUs (central processing unit, the thing which makes your computer go, its core heart/brain).
<BR>
First of all, for your information, AMD is an AMERICAN company.
<BR>
Currently, AMD is changing the market in the worst for Intel (which have been for the past years dominant, almost monopolizing, in the CPU market) and heading them in development progress.
<BR>
Prediction reports that in couple of years AMD will sell more proccessors than Intel which preform way better than Intel's chips.
<BR>
AMD's chips are already well known as the better brand and sought after, it is estimated that they will take well over 50% of the Intel's market pie which so far was solely owned by Intel.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
You might have a point there, but still I must ammend.
<BR>
One of the best way to protect yourself (and belive me, you are VERY "naked" and inviting) from getting hacked, is to understand the way these things work and how it is being done.
<BR>
Many companies currently in the industry employ in their service Ex-Hackers/Crackers to create defense systems against such intrusions.
<BR>
I myself often seeking the advices of friends who are such "knowledgeable" so I may know if I have done something to leave an open window or easy access to outside attacks, and how can I protect myself better from the such.
<BR>

5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
If your child spends so much time on the Net, tell him to "get a life", if he/she are getting aggravated they're computer junkies.
<BR>
As for what they're likly to be using the computer for:
<BR>
60% Playing games.
<BR>
20% Searching for fan sites for the hobbies (your child isn't a pyromaniac right?... =D just joking).
<BR>
10% Studying, learning something (yes, this DOES includes programming and other computer related education which may come very handy when applying for a job).
<BR>
10% Making illegal actions.
<BR>

<BR>
DOS, abbriviation for Denial of Service, is when you keep sending huge chunks of information to some service provider (website hosting server, game hosting server, ordinary people using the Internet, etc.) "flooding" the bandwidth and unallowing customers to reach through.
<BR>
As you said you use AOL, I HIGHLY doubt it is possible to do so from your home computer, unless you are some rockafeller or certain other rich fellow (bill gates's relative? heh) and employ your own high speed wide bandwidth connection device from T1 to OC-3 standards.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
Quake is nothing more than a virutal game, from the type reffered to as FPS, abbriviation for First Person (look) Shooter.
<BR>
It is a game where you move around picking weapons and shooting creatures to rack up high score and finish the game.
<BR>
Although there are always some out of the normal occasions (face it, rapers, murders etc. of the sort have been in existance way long before the psychiatry science or computer games were invented), I highly doubt your child will become a "blood sick maddog" from playing it and go shooting ppl out of no reason.
<BR>
Personally, in my humble opinion, there are way better games of this type, and better games of other types as well (although this is like comparing tomatos to pickles so it's a dumb thing to say heh but basically I say, Quake stinks, get a better game like Baldur's Gate :D).
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in. Keep trying to get through to him, no matter how much he retreats into himself. 
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>
Well, this I will easily write off (having psychology under my belt) as, in one word, puberty.
<BR>
I suggest you attend to your local psycholog for family sessions and start talking your problems and concerns over.
<BR>
Also do not forget, your child is in a phase where he/she will need their own space and freedom.
<BR>
If they're for example, want to do piercing (what is wrong with the youth nowdays?) or tattoo, try to talk them out of it, tell them of the dangers of complicated infections, deseases like AIDs they can catch etc.
<BR>
If it doesn't succeed, then tell them you agree, to a small proprtion of such procedure, AND that you will be present when they do it.
<BR>
Pick by yourself an establishment that is respectable, aestethic, sanitry place and that has been approved by the health department.
<BR>
Then see the child by/through the procedure and help in the disinfections needed untill the complete healing.
<BR>
It is important that you will escort your child through their puberty, and make it sure that they know they can always come to you for advice, help, etc. and tell you anything.
<BR>
Don't forget, you can't "smog" your child, you have to make compromises in some to retain his/hers continued trust and openess in your relationship.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Reading from here on leads me to belive/conclude that either:
<BR>
1. This entire article/post you made is a joke.
<BR>
2. You are one of those national extrimist, thinking they're patriots defending America against the "Red Menace" (I suggest walking into the nearest psychatrist office and asking to be admitted into hospitalization for sanity-reality check).
<BR>
3. You have been mislead by some very bad sources.
<BR>

<BR>
For your information, hackers/crackers tend to be personals with high I.Q. so I doubt they'll be failling their academic education.
<BR>

<BR>
With that said, I end.
<BR>
Either way, get help man, both from computer proffesional and a psychological one.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
First I would like to say that I'm hoping the "Is Your Son A Computer Hacker"
<BR>
is a joke, because just reading it I saw manything which were "truths" put together from pieces of truths. If it is a joke then this is a waste of typing if it isn't then may god help us all. To say the least there were many things wrong. 
<BR>
The programs listed by Mr. Gibbons as hacker programs are nothing even close, 
<BR>

<BR>
"Comet Cursor", a program which allows websites to dynamicly modify the cursor when a person visits their site.
<BR>
"Bonzi Buddy", a little purple ape, I think it is a microsoft agent I'm not to sure
<BR>
"Flash", a program which allows you to view vector animations.
<BR>

<BR>
Continueing from the programs "Quake" is not a hacker virtual reality, but rather a game. The game is made by ID software. The DOSing idea is pretty wrong too DOS is Disk Operating System while DoS is Denial of Service. Now DOS and DoS are very different. DOS was the operating system which ruled the computer world before windows ( yes I know unix was around don't flame me just yet ). DoS is an attack on a network or user which does exactly what the acronym implies, Denies Service. I found sign number 8 very funny, Mainly because of the destroying part of your harddrive, this is not true, you could get the impression that part of your harddrive is destroyed but in reality it is just re partitioned, and set to a format not used by windows or dos. The belief that it is dangerous is completely not true, how ever many hacking related programs are writting for a *nix based system due to the high level of internet related control. Under a *nix system you are very able to do most anything you would want to a packet. Now that I have trailed slightly off subject, its time to return to the point, 
<BR>
Asking for a better computer isn't a sign of hacking, most attacks, or intrusions can be done on a relatively low machine with a 3 disk install of trinux, no need to have something fancy, usually in the event of a possible break in attempt the hacker will use a shell, so needing a fast machine is by no means related to hacking. I my self needed a faster machine, not for hacking, but high end 3d animation. That is all I think I need to say, if your worried your son/daughter is a hacker and need more information you can contact me at crackpipe2k@hotmail.com . 
<BR>

<BR>
The more I read this article the more I think it's a joke. Now that I actually put some thought into it, it is definately a joke. Well its useless to just backspace all this post time ....................................................................................<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
In addition to "Linux", "hacker manuals", "Flash media player", "computer upgrades", and anything requireing the creativity to write code, you forgot to add corresponding with the boogey man.  I suppose involving oneself with javascript would be akin to dancing with the devil.  What you are insinuating is that if your kids are interested in writing code, WATCH OUT!! and lock up the guns.  This is a laughable article based on ignorance.
<BR>

<BR>
I find it incredibally odd that a family espousing ultra conservative morals such as this yet do not "spank" the children.  This article is nothing but a collection of contradictions and "by-the-book" generalizations.  The account of the "sons" degenerate behavior lists every warning sign (and then some) for the next serial killer.  Even serial killers don't exhibit all the warning signs, i find it incredible that this kid was a textbook example.
<BR>

<BR>
i am a teacher and i work with kids in a poor area.  The kids i teach don't have beds to sleep in and most only get a hot meal when they are at school.  I can tell you with experience that it takes more than "Quake" to make a kid a terrorist. And the information within this fictional account has absolutely no basis of proof. I am a Quake board member, i play quake, i make maps for quake, and i use quake in an educational setting with the use of a mod for extracting the gibbing.  It's a great tool for allowing students to experience "virtually" the places they study (ex...Egypt studies follow with a tour of a "virtual" pyramid with quake).
<BR>

<BR>
The only reason i am responding is because people actually read this stuff and believe it and i want to express to everyone reading this article that it is indeed fiction.

If your son spends more than 30 mins on the internet, he may be DOSing sites lmfao!! You are really retarded.  (If you're serious)

<BR>

<BR>
How about researching a little bit before you decide to print an article like this.  AMD is a "third world" company that makes "inferior" processors? According to my research, AMD has it's corporate headquarters based in Sunnyvale, California...hmmmm.  Oh, and by the way, AMD chips perform better.
<BR>

<BR>
I could go on and on about this article forever, but I won't.  Last point, though.
<BR>
You stated:
<BR>
"BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos."
<BR>
First of all, I think you mean Linus Torvalds, who was a native of Helsinki, Finland, so that does not make him a "Soviet" as Finland was never a member-state of the Soviet Union or the communist bloc.  And he created "Linux" not "Lunix"...Debian and Mandrake are different versions of Linux, and they are LEGAL operating systems.  What exactly is an "illegal" operating syystem anyway?  I haven't ever heard of any operating systems being outlawed...oh, nevermind...this was a completely misinformed article, and if the author actually believes the contents then that person is a very misinformed individual.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">That YOU SIR, know nothing at all, about computers, and their communities.  If you are saying, that anyone who asks for more memory, an AMD processor, new hard drives, plays any of the Quake games, or spends lots of time on their computer, is a hacker, then I seriously think you should appoligise to almost everyone in the damn world.  I for one, have an AMD cpu, i have asked for more memory and new hard drives from my dad, I play a lot of Quake2, and i do, spend quite a lot of time on my computer.  Now what you are basically saying is, I am a hacker.  That is the biggest ammount of bollox i have ever heard.  I think all hackers should be locked up and never let back out.  If your children ask for new parts for their computer, it does not mean they want to hack someone.  You can hack someone with a 56k modem, a 200mhz pentium whatever, and 32mb of ram.  When your son asked for new parts, he probably wanted an upgrade from the Compaq piece of junk.  AMD are the best processors out there at the moment, I wanted a 1.4GHz one because they are basically the same as an Intel Pentium 4 2GHz, because Pentium suck.  The more ram you have, the more you can feel the difference.  I used to have 128mb, i now have 256mb and i have really felt the difference.
<BR>
Quake2 then.  I enjoy playing quake2, ive been playing it for almost 2 years now, its not a social meeting place for all the hackers of the world.  I know lots of people who play lots of different games, and, yes, there are the odd few twats that hack.  But not all of them.
<BR>
Im not trying to be nasty to you, I just think you should lay off mate.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You, the author of the article, are insane, and I will proceed to tell you why.  You are smothering your son and trying to make him a proxy of all the things that you believe, regardless of their validity.  Your son was not hacking.  Linux is NOT an illegal program and even if it did come out of the Soviet Union, so did tetris and I have yet to see you anyone up in arms about that.  Also, Linux is much more customizable and easy to use than Windows, and is also more stable.  The programs that you did not install were drivers that enabled your son to view complex and interesting websites(I'm not talking about porn).  There is nothing illegal about them, in fact they are used by just about every professional website on the net.  The AMD chip is not illegal nor are they cheap knock-offs.  They are in fact faster than Pentiums and more reliable.  I fthey are made in 3rd world countries, so what.  Many products are made in 3rd world countries.  The change in your son's behavior is probably just the result of him becoming an adolescent and evolving different interests.  His "negative" responses to your accusations are perfectly valid.  You were punishing him for doing nothing other than developing new interests in an area that you do not understand at all.  Your encroachment and constant monitoring will only make him more eager to get away from you.  Attempting to regulate his life and his friends will only create a festering resentment for you.  If you truly love your son then you will allow him to develop his own opinions and interests and allow him to grow up.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You have as closed a mind as I have seen for a long time, and seem prone to painting all things with a broad brush before you have even a basic understanding of what you are speaking about.  Maybe you need to spend more time on the computer rather than limiting your son's.  Another thought, couldn't your daughter become a hacker, or is that too much for your sexist, closed mind to conceive?!?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
your article is like a drink to a thirsty man. It is so hard, living in Europe as I do, to get clear advice that I can easily understand on this important aspect of parenting. Indeed most of the parents I meet at my son's school are loath to believe that there is any risk to their children at all. They consider "Hacking" as something that goes on in America or on television and will never affect them. Now I have something to print out for them and maybe give them something to think about.
<BR>

<BR>
One very useful suggestion which you might add to the list of valuable information you provide is to put the family computer in the same room as you, the parent, will spend most of the day. For example, our computer is in the television room. This allows me to monitor my sons use of the internet and watch for the types of innapropriate behaviours you mention. It also allows the family to discuss any confusing or disturbing material that might inadvertently be discovered during a "surf".
<BR>

<BR>
So, once again, thank you for an excellent article. I am only sorry that you had to endure the kind of profanity you brought down apon yourself from those who feel sensitive at you exposing them!
<BR>

<BR>

Kids just mess around with computers, they read about programming, that's normal, maybe he has a genius on his hands. All that's wrong with the kid is that he's a computernerd. But hey, what can you say...
<BR>

<BR>
But I guess Mr Gibbons won't understand... He loves it the American way, he loves Intel, Microsoft, AOL, I'm sure he uses Altavista or Yahoo!. AMD, Linux (or "Lunix"), everything non-American is bad, communism is taboo. He's the one who voted for Bush. He's one of the reasons why two towers went down in New York a few months ago.
<BR>

<BR>
I guess some Americans will never learn. It's sad...

Perhaps a child should not be spending entire days in front of a computer, but that does not mean that they are a hacker.  Also, there are many reasons to switch from AOL to a better browser or internet server. Others are faster, more efficient, and cheaper.

<BR>

<BR>
200 years ago, every house had a gun above their doorway. For protection. Indians, robbers, animals, etc.All the boys were taught how to use these guns, and when to use them. Now, instead of being taught,people choose to steer away from them. So now, everyone is ignorant of a firearm, save a few, and more often then not, people that have been TAUGHT how to use and respect firearms are more likely to grow up to be police officers, an officer in an army, some military or defense posistion. Not a killer. no one dreamed about taking a gun to school then, why now?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
A meeting place for hackers? That doesnt mean they all use Quake. Don't be specific. I play on battle.net from anywhere to 1 all the way to 5 hours, almost e v e r y d a y. I do not hack, in fact, i am in a group that DOESN'T HACK. A group of teenagers. We are anti-hack, and I have turned in over 1000 sites with my clanmates to Blizzard, the creators of our games.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Also, it sounds as if you need to BACK OFF. Your "model family" makes me sick. Your family is probably one that keeps drastically to themselves, and marks may be slipping due to manic depression, caused by not enough social activity, rather then computer radiation. My marks have imporved since i started playing on-line, and my stress level has been reduced. If anyone's son's marks are failing, they should teach them when to do their homework, or help them sometimes, not dominate over them and tell them everything that's right and wrong. There IS NO SUCH THING AS RIGHT OR WRONG. Only a difference of opinions. If you don't believe that, you'll be torn apart in this new "free world" of ours.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

First of all... If this "father" had done his research properly he wouldn't say this at all...Unless he's a complete fool... Well he propably uses Windows so... Actually all that he is saying is that if you aren't "normal" (listening to Britney spears, wear modern clothes... etc...) then you must be a  computer-hacker because you can't use your computer to play games, oh no, that is hacking. Btw, Linux is one the most useful operating systems ever made... It works about a million times better than ANYTHING Microsoft ever have and will make...

Let the kids make mistakes its how we learn.  Do you expect that your son or daughter will invite you to come along when he or she is gunna get laid?  Get a grip man, let your kids live their lives.  Secondly, along with everyone else who has commented on this post, you obviously know NOTHING about computers.  If your son was a "hacker" he would not have to worry about AOL because that newbie ISP can be fucked with more then any other.  Comet Cursor my friend, is a program that allows you to change the appearance of the desktop cursor, don't ask me how the fuck you decided it was a hack but you are dead wrong.  Macromedia Flash is a successful program used by companies and individuals across the globe to produce animations for websites, projects and other useful things.  Unless your son wanted to create a hackers website using Flash I think you oughta put down the crack pipe and read a book.  By far the FUNNIEST point in your article was that of Quake.  I have been a Quake player for years upon years, and never before have I heard it referred to as a gathering for hackers.  Quake is a GAME can I stress that enough, a fucking GAME!  You know those things you probably don't let your kids play because you are a Jesus freak and it will rott their innocent brains.  Your son doesn't need shit to be a hacker, if he is asking for new hardware its probably because you bought your kids a fucking COMPAQ!  Video cards do not in anyway enhance the ability of someone to hack.  And, Lunix as you call it, we in the real world call it Linux, is one of the best operating systems, it is incredibley stable, offers amazing support for webservers and home networks.  A kids social behaviour changes when they hit puberty, I would have hoped to god you knew that, of course he is going to argue with you, listen to yourself you virtually spy on your kids left and right.  Whats this about locking up your guns?  Ever thought of getting rid of them for your own sake before your kids go nutty and blow your fucking brains out?  I could go on forever, but by now I bet you've already sacrificed your family to save them from the evil people on the internet who want to send you "adult" content.  LET YOUR KIDS LIVE, LET HIM DOWNLOAD PROGRAMS, LET HIM PLAY GAMES, LET HIM WATCH PORN, LET HIM HAVE A LIFE OR HE WILL BE A SOCIAL DEAD BEAT WITH NO FRIENDS AND NO LIFEEEEE!!!!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Oh, I felt that you might need some more interesting information on other subjects. Let's take your car. Did you know that the cigarette lighter in your car is a homing device for the government? That's how most criminals are tracked these days. The rearview mirror is their camera to see inside the car to see who is in there. Switching subjects, your work place. I don't know what type of job you have, apparently not computer related, but the coffee machine they use actually has a drug to make you work harder but alters your mind to make you work for less. Now you are thinking, maybe the phone is bugged. I really don't think so.... The rings that are setup on the phones send a subconscious message every time it rings compelling you to never complain about your job and that your work is VERY VERY IMPORTANT (trust me, I worked for a company that did this, AMD). But it doesn't stop there; they even invade your home. Construction companies are paid by the government to have voice recorders and video surveillance devices to monitor the house for possible terrorist attacks. If that weren't enough, they have setup a "front" business of telemarketers. When they mispronounce your name, it is really setting up a base line for the lie detector test. Subconsciously they are asking your mind questions while they are on the phone with you. The information is recorded into a database to mark possible threats to the economy, Internet, and the American Freedom. 
<BR>

<BR>
I hope this information will be read so as to educate the stupid masses.
<BR>

<BR>
P.S.-I sure hope you believe me b/c if you do, you are a moron like believing Mr. Gibbons that the top 10 hacker signs. He has no idea of anything and I am surprised that he could even submit a message board post without fearing hackers were trying to hack in and steal all of his personal information and turning his computer into a zombie.

I find some of your comments so off the mark it isn't even funny. Your suggestion that AMD is a third rate processor shows just how computer ILLITERATE you are! Today even as we speak INTEL and AMD are running neck n neck to trying to beat the other to market with the next fastest processor! You have abviously not checked out some of the computer reviews out there! I know of many companies who use AMD as their standard of choice! How much Intel stock do you own?
<BR>

<BR>
Your decision process needs some SERIOUS work! Spending alot of time ONLINE WILL NOT GIVE YOU MENINGITIS!! It will NOT give you any psychological disorders, it may highlight problems already there but it will NOT create them.
<BR>

<BR>
Now onto a subject more to the point, the online game of QUAKE is NOT a place for hackers to visit!!! I have been on the internet since 1996 and on othe forms of communication via computers since 1988. Quake is ONLINE GAMING, yes you do use weapons of many discriptioins some semi real some completely made up. What it does do is require you to interact with as many as 20+ people who are connect to one computer. The people connected to the one computer did not join to sit around and shoot the shit, they came to test their gaming skills against others on the one computer! I have been personally gaming for over 4 years! I would suggest you go pull your head out of that back woods cave and get a clue!
<BR>

<BR>
For the most part you are trying to blame your POOR parenting skills on technology! The computer WILL NOT replace a parent! IT is YOUR job as a parent to go in an look over your childs shoulder and understand what they are trying to do! If you are waiting for another child to tattle on a child you have already lost the fight! You are like so many other parents out there these days depening on the TV or the COMPUTER  to raise their childeren instead of being a real parent!!

<BR>

<BR>
I feel so sorry for your kids... having their parents turn up at parties so they dont drink.. you are going to cause more mental damage than any form of good.
<BR>

<BR>
What kind of parents breathes over their kids shoulder every second of their life... do you supervise them while they go to the toilet aswell, or while they are in the shower?
<BR>

<BR>
You say you dont want your kids to be anti-social, well do you think your gonna be helping them by embaressing them by turning up at parties??? The whole point of going to a teenage partie is to get away from your parents so that you can experiment, experiment does not mean they will do drugs, that depends on how you raise your kids.
<BR>
They will be rejected by everyone at their school because they are branded as 'faggots' or 'daddys boy'... no wonder your kid is resorting to an "internet-life" because he has no friends in real life. Thanks to you.. you evil bastard...
<BR>

<BR>
Im not a hacker and i dont like hackers but what you are doing there is scaring the shit out of clue-less parents (such as yourself, more shit comes out of your mouth than your ass, which is reflected in that load of crap you just wrote).
<BR>

<BR>
Beleive it or not my old man brought me up well, i have respect for everyone, especially adults, i work full time as a computer programmer (no im not a fuckin hacker, sure i may have text-flooded a few chat channels but i hardly call that hacking) but he didnt over-protect me, he let me go out knowing i was going to get drunk underage, because he knew i was going to do it anyway and the earlier you develop your life skills (which can not be taught by lectures from parents, as you seem to think) the better.
<BR>

<BR>
All i can say is.... im glad your not my father and i feel so sorry for your kids... they must have really boring lives...

<BR>
LINUX, not lunix.  This is a very powerful and stable operating system and if possible, you should encourage your children to learn it.  Just because you dont understand something does not make it a hacker O/S.  I run Linux at home and also use it at work, not to hack.  So are you saying that the company I work for (a respected ISP by the way) pays me to hack things?  I think not.
<BR>

<BR>
Second, as for the books this guy listed, science fiction is very interesting.  Have you ever seen Star Wars or Star Trek?   HACKER!!!! You must be a hacker if you like science fiction.
<BR>
lol (that means laughing out loud, it is not some secret hacker code).  For the "programming with Perl" book: You should encourage your children to read such books if they are interested in them.  This is an educational book on a scripting language.  Perhaps your son just has an interest in programming.  Programmers get paid good money to write software.  It is a very respectable and challenging career.  And remember, your precious "Windows O/S" would not exist if it were not for these programmers (these "hackers" as you put it).
<BR>

<BR>
Third, as for the references about your children changing their appearances... don't kids do that all the time?  I guess if they stay out later then their curfew, their hackers as well.  Or if they complain about doing their chores etc. Teenagers always rebel and disagree with their parents point of view.  This is normal.  As for the clothes issue, they are just trying to figure out who they are as people.  Let them explore this and you will find that they will grow up to be much more open to other peoples differences...something that is very lacking in this world, apparently.
<BR>

<BR>
As for Quake...well this is obvious, it's a game, it is not a secret hackers world where hackers go to talk about hacking.  It is a game that people play online against other people.  Just because they didn't have such intense games in your time, do not label them as hacker anything.
<BR>

<BR>
The bottom line is that it's unfortunate that some people will read this and believe this disinformation, go and accuse their children of something they aren't doing and possibly cause a traumatic experience for the poor kid.  Would you rather have your kids hanging out in the street witnessing, if not participating in drug use and violence?  Or would you rather have them at home, in their room playing a video game, or chatting with friends, or dare I say it...learning something?
<BR>

<BR>
Children will be much better off when parents stop thinking that their kids are doing bad things right off the bat.  Start taking an honest interest in your kids lives.  Don't accuse them of hacking, ask your kid what fascinates them about what they are doing...whether that is a game or scripting language, or whatever.  Get them to show you what they can do.  You'll be impressed.

You need a MAJOR wake up all. Did you know that the server this webpage is on is running DEBIAN LINUX!!! HOLY SHIT. The Commies got us again!!! Those bastards are always trying to spread their illegal software all over, even though most are designed in the US, and are recommended to be used by IBM for all servers... Hmm, well that was ignorant fact #1. Lets get right on to #2, Flash? Bonsai Buddy? Comet Cursor!? hahaha. Sorry Mr. Parent of the Year, but Flash is an ANIMATION PROGRAM. You punished your kid for learning how to draw on the web, you punished him for being creative. Comet Cursor, makes your cursor look like something different, like a bird or some other random thing. I know, I know, the world hasnt been introduced to the elite cursor hacking team. They got me, now im stuck with an arrow that points right instead of left for a cursor. Damn shit, it sucks. Is your son becoming argumentative? Maybe its becuase hes a fucking teen, did you think about that? Or, maybe its becuase you punish him for using a program designed to buld animations for websites!! (maybe it was those damn Russians, they always get ya were it hurts.) now for #4, the "Radical" clothing. What you are describing, is not a hacker, its a farking RAVER. Of course, you dont know what a RAVER is, but it the new cult thing to be, listen to "Techno" music and dance for hours(This of course was introduced by the Red Bastard Soveits to kill our youths). #5 AMD? Knockoffs? Ha! AMD just so happens to be the best competitor for Intel brand processors, at a mere fraction of the price. AMD is clearly the devil, if your son asked for one, i would DEFINATLY take your child outside and beat the fuck out of him with a baseball bat(not aluminum silly, they learn more when you use wood) Im going to stop now simply becuase the Evil Rusian hackers have just employed me to use the evil AMD procesors with "faster" video card( running linux) of course, to hack you. Ill be hacking you with a game called "quake". Quake is a great hacking platform. simply becuase it is a game, and what would you use a game for? to play? NOO WAYY! to HACK! DUH! Ill feel sorry for you, your gonna get hacked so hard with quake, its not going to be funny. Oh yeh, by the way, your son has been eating food these days. The devil is the one who taught us to eat things...Its quite obivous he is under the control of the devil. Take him out back of your lovely victorian house and burn him at the stake, it'll teach him never to hack again. and never to defy his bright ol' Pa. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
After reading your article, I confronted him with the fact that it said "LILO" when the computer was starting, or 'booting' as hackers say and after a short while he actually admitted to being a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
Earlier, he had told me to press enter to get past it into windows but I think he was trying to fool me somehow, so I turned it off instead.
<BR>

<BR>
Since he admitted this I couldn't possibly give him a spanking, as this would undoubtedly have the wrong effects (much like you, I am against this). So the punishment was simply being banned from the computer, I hope you agree with me that this is sufficient.
<BR>

<BR>
I thank you for this article which really explained to me what this LUNIX is all about, I did suspect something fishy but I had no hard evidence, thanks to you now I do. I forced my son to remove the hard disk drive it was stored on and it has been sent to the manufacturer so that they can delete the drive (except for my word documents). Who knows what might have happened if I wouldn't have? I hope that lunix hasn't been installed on the screen and/or the modem, because my son promised he hadn't done this after his admission of being a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
I would like to end this thank you note by saying that I truly wish there would be more people like you out there to work against hacking and its effects on society.

Everything he posted was completely wrong and I hope to god he gets sued by every company he slandered. You are a moron for even considering anything that he posted valid. Your ignorance amazes me. Its amazing how little people like you know about computers. All that crap Gibbons posted about lunix is completely false and unfounded. I know you know absolutely nothing about computers because you hope your son didn't infect your modem or "screen" (commonly referred to as a monitor by those that have any kind of a brain), you cant install stuff on your modem or "screen" you quarterwit (halfwit doesn't quite explain what you are). And you turned you computer off because your son told you to press enter to get into windows, you are fucking stupid. I hope you spent a lot of hard earned money getting your hard drive fixed, because all you did was waist it. Even if your son was a hacker (I suspect he actually wasn't but like the Salem witch trials you made him admit to it even if he didn't do it) he could have made a nice living when he was older with those computer skills he learned. You do realize that hackers make A LOT of money in the computer consulting business, more than you could ever make (im guessing you work at the local grocery store because your too stupid to work anywhere else). Get ready to call people like me and your son "boss" because if you know nothing about computers you will never make it in today's world. In closing id like to say that both you and Mr. Gibbons are the two most stupidest people alive and both of you should be shot to keep from polluting the gene pool any further than you have. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Playing quake wont make your son violent, hanging out with gangs and smoking drugs will. How about the comments about asking for new hardware, maybe that is because the computer is lame and doesnt run fast enough (thats generally why you upgrade it.....dur)Your whole vision on hackers is stupid and you seriously need to get a life instead of whinging about other people on bulletin boards.

Luckily, some of them are enlightened to the fact that not everything unconventional is considered "HACKING".  And let me clear up a couple of facts for you.  "Quake" is a first person shooter game that can be purchased in almost any computer store.  It can be played accross the internet so you can play against human players instead of the pre-programmed computer apponents.  This could be the reason your son wanted a faster ISP as well.  This game works much better with larger bandwidth.  Allowing for faster play and more intense melee.  The video card could also come from this; being a game, it does need a somewhat robust video card.  And what it's "Linux" not "Lunix".  Linux is a very popular platform used in high end servers and mainframes.  It's also very difficult to use and skilled techinicians are both high payed and not needed.  I would embrace this and support your son.  Do not banish him from the computer because as we know, forbidden fruit makes a great meal.  In short, get your facts straight, and get more involved in your son's life in a productive manner.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Just as playing on a Playstation2, DreamCast, and other game consoles. You can find Quake on some of these consoles too! Linux, not Lunix, is a very important Operating System. It is used to run gaming servers, webservers [adequacy.org is probably running on one], and other server things such as your ISP! Nothing to do with hacking. AMD makes a good processor and I prefer them over Intel. I don't know where you got this sweatshop crap!  There are also other errors in your writing that I don't care to edit.

To start with ONE glaring mistake, "Flash" and "CometCursor" are NOT hacker programs. They are internet browsing software designed to enhance the internet experience. CometCursor simply changes your cursor (the little "arrow" on your screen) to look different if a site owner has the CometCursor feature on his page. Flash can be used to display Flash movies (not like "normal" movies at all) or simply make a greatly enhanced webpage with graphics, sounds, and an interactive environment.
<BR>

<BR>
The mysterious and enigmatic "Quake" that you refer to as if it were a dark cesspool and meeting ground for social delinquents and criminals is a GAME. G-A-M-E. You control a character, and yes, you run around shooting things, but if you suggest banning your "child" from using it, you are going too far (unless your kid is under 15 or whatever the game is rated for). If you go so far as to suggest contacting the school when you find that your kid is playing the game, you border on psychotic. I know I said I would try to remain objective, but it is hard to be that when you make such outrageously ridiculous comments. Children that play violent video games and then end up hurting others (with guns or without) are either mentally unstable to begin with, or have bad parents. It really is as simple as that.
<BR>

At first, I was laughing at your article, but humor can only last for so long. I will only say two more things: brush up on your research skills, and for your own sake, open your eyes.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I have been part of the industry and "community" for YEARS and I can respect what you are trying to say, BUT MY GOD WOMAN!  The things you are saying are working against all your good intentions.  
<BR>
Trust me when I say that all kids and "hackers" are flying to this page and laughing, and laughing and laughing (some of them are responding).
<BR>

<BR>
-Everyone needs a better ISP than AOL or any "national".
<BR>
-Bonzi buddy is a search engine/concierge.
<BR>
-Comet Cursor is a script that makes your cursor change while on a specific webpage.
<BR>
-Linux is an operating system, much like windows except that it is "open-source".
<BR>
-Flash is an animation-maker program for making things move and shimmy on the internet.
<BR>
-Everyone needs a better video card for GAMING or for programs like ADOBE PHOTOSHOP.  I have never heard a "hacker" say: "Man when I script code on my 16Mb PCI vid-card, it really slogs out." -Ridiculous.
<BR>
-Some of the "Hacking Manuals" you mention are Top 10 best sellers AND HOW CAN YOU INCLUDE "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly when you obviously haven't read any of them?  Your son may have grown up to become a "master" programmer.  Too bad you've limited him to being a nerd to today's society by eliminating his computer time.  Not that stopping him at home would really stop a kid anyway. He could've become a hot commodity to a big company one day, but along came you and with a few misplaced suspicions.  it's a shame you didn't research his behavior like you said you did, or you wouldn't have written what you did.
<BR>
-Ahhh, I'm too tired to continue.  I am not policing your lack of research here, so I don't have time or inclination to go research out where Linux came from in order to continue...
<BR>

<BR>
BAWHAWHAW!!!!  AMD.....LOL

If nothing else, you gave me a good chuckle tonight.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The writer of the previous article knows almost nothing about computers.   HACKING is a subjective term, there are several meanings to the word. and it shouldn't be used so losely when making accusations. <BR><BR>
1.  AOL was rated second from the bottom as an internet provider in a recent survey by Consumer Reports (with MSN close behind) so that should tell you why anyone who used the service would want to change providers.<BR><BR>

2.  Anyone who uses a computer regulary and learns much about it will eventually install applications that extend the use of the computer.  There are very few applications out there that can be used for hacking, not all of them are illegal.  "Flash" is an internet pluggin that allows the user to view multimedia, it is similar to RealPlayer, Quicktime, and Windows Media Player and CANNOT be used in any way to hack anything.  This just shows you how ignorant this guy is.<BR><BR>

3.   You got a Compaq, you got your kid a second rate computer and he wants a better one - I'm not supprised he'd complain.
AMD is not anything near what you have described.  First of all proccessors can only be produced in strictly controled environments by well trained personell.  Secondly, anyone who is not suspicious of your claims about AMD is far too dense to attempt to reason with.
<BR><BR>

4.  The only book that might in ANY WAY be used for hacking there is the Pearl scripting book.  On the other hand, if your kid can do pearl scripting I'd say you've got a fairly intelligent kid.  If you choose not to encourage the child in his/her interests and potentioally stifle his/her development that's your choice.<BR><BR>

5.  Spending more than 30 minutes in no way means that your child is DOS'ing someone else.  The process of downloading and attacking another computer can be done in a couple minutes.  Talk to your kids and ask them to teach you about what they're doing if you're suspicious of their actions.  Censorship  has never been an acceptable answer.<BR><BR>

6.  Quake is a violent game.  You may be suspicious of what they say because you don't understand l33t(pronounced "Leet") speak.  Some of them may be hackers, but for the most part it's just kids acting macho.<BR><BR>

7.  Anyone who is older than 12 knows this describes every teen-ager.<BR><BR>

8.  Linux is a free alternative to the over priced Microsoft Operating system.  Like with PEARL, if your kid understands this stuff, encourage him/her.  That kind of knowledge can be an asset to your child's career.<BR><BR>

9.  This describes your typical raver.  Ravers are clueless drug addled hippies that go to all-night dances with repeditive music.  Then again, your child may only be dressing this way because he/she wants to fit in with a group of people that sympathize with him/her.<BR><BR>

10.  Computer Radiation, eh?  EMF's?  ....can't argue with him there, now can we?<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT></td>

(Gasp! Get out the heart pills before you read the next sentence!) It does not.  If you don't believe me, go to the FOLDOC (Free OnLine Dictionary of Computing) website at this URL(http://www.instantweb.com/D/dictionary/contents.html) and look up "hacker".  You'll find that even though the definition of "hacker" according to the general public is there, there are several different meanings to the word, most of which simply mean "geek" or "avid computer user".
<BR>
"Quake" is NOT a hacker's tool just because some guy on a server says 1337 h4x0r.  Although Quake 3 could be used for actual hacking purposes, Quake is simply a GAME, NOT A HACKER'S TOOL.  If it was designed to be a hacker's tool, then you sure as hell wouldn't see it on the shelves at Best Buy.

There is always the need for new hardware upgrades to play the latest and greatest computer games.  Do you honestly expect that once you buy a computer, it will always be good enough to run every new software program ever to be created?  "AMD" is simply a processor manufacturer that is popular among geeks.  Those processors simply CAN'T be made in a Chinese sweat shop.  They're a little more complicated than your Happy Meal toy at McDonald's.
<BR>

<BR>
You can't assume automatically that if your kid installs a program, it's the digital version of a nuke and force them to delete it.
<BR>

<BR>
You're so-called "hacker manuals" DON'T TEACH YOU EXACTLY HOW TO HACK.  The next thing I'll hear is that if your kid decides to do anything on the computer, then jump on them and maul their ass half to death to teach them that it's "evil".
<BR>

<BR>
"Lunix" is not a hacking tool, just an implementation of UNIX, if you amoebas have any idea what that is.  EVERY PART OF THE ARTICLE automatically assumes that "hacker" means "evil genius"!  Maybe before making decisions for your kids, TALK TO THEM FOR GOD'S SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you just understood your kids, then your kids wouldn't be so f***ed up.  Oh yeah, and stop blaming the media for your own parental mistakes.

"Quake" is a GAME, much like doom and wolfenstein, that is played by thousands on the internet.  The game is played largely against other people on the internet for multiplayer fun.  "Linux," not "Lunix" as you say, is an operating system that isnt as successful as the widely used "Windows." If you want proof, go to a local Wal-Mart or Office Depot and look for Quake (there is Quake 2 and Quake 3 sequels that are very poplular as well) in the games section, and Linux in the Operating system section. As for changing ISP's, AOL is a VERY slow ISP that can make playing Quake very unenjoyabe because the game becomes choppy from  information in the game coming much slower on AOL than some other ISP's may provide. A better video card, or a faster computer can also make playing quake a lot more enjoyable, it can make the game look better graphically and can speed the game's slowdown up a lot.  AMD is also a chipset that is rival to Pentium, but, until recently, AMD has been making FASTER chips than Pentium and they are often less expensive than Pentium brands as well.  I'm afraid that you didnt research very much before you wrote this article. Hope you know how to say "I'm sorry" to your son, because if this is the signs you are talking about, you are VERY mistaken.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">     When i first read this topic it was pretty funny. I thought it was a joke that some guy in his basement cooked up. But then i realized it was serious! Gave me a good laught actually, and i thank the person who started this post for that. 
<BR>
  But now that i've realized that the topic starter was serious with this, i'd like to make a few corrections and suggestions for the parents, and to any parents out there. 
<BR>

<BR>
    Firstly, please please please learn to RESEARCH your stuff before posting. Most of the things that the topic poster said was false.
<BR>
And i'm here to tell you about it. Some may have already told you about them but the site was too slow.
<BR>
   i) Quake is a game. It's for entertainment. It's like Doom, Half-Life..etc. People play it because it's fun. HOw should i put this? It's like playing solitaire. It's a GAME! 
<BR>

<BR>
   ii) Linux, BSD..especially BSD are industry standard operating systems. Which means that they are SERVER operating systems, an example of a site that uses FreeBSD is www.google.com a popular search engine. If the topic poster believed that BSD was an illegal hacking program, then www.google.com should've been halted a long time ago. They are COMPLETELY LEGAL, the term for that is OPEN SOURCE, which means that the software, in this case, the "illegal" operating systems, aren't bound by copyrights and patents. Open Source means that people can come in and change the operating system in the hopes of making the operating system better. 
<BR>
    iii) "Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash"." A little clarification for you, Comet Cursos is an application that lets you install customized cursors (the mouse pointer), which means you can have an image of a pencil as your mouse pointer instead of an arrow. Bonzi Buddy, which in my opinion is a useless application, is simply a collection of tools, such as a search engine, alarm clock..etc. And Flash is an application that is used fairly extensively in the web development field to create Flash Animations. 
<BR>
   iv)  "Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards". Asking for a new video card doesn't do anything to enhance hacking. When the topic posters son was askin this, prolly just means that one of his games doesn't look too good on the computer. 
<BR>
...there are many more things i can say but i'd rather not continue since i've said too much already. I urge the topic poster, T Reginald Gibbons, to email me-&gt; rsdl@hotmail.com , because i believe that wherever he got his information from, was false. And i'm very curious as to where he got these information from. 
<BR>

<BR>
Thank you. i've wasted your time long enough.
<BR>
good day
<BR>

<BR>
I would just like to say that whoever wrote this has problems. First off Compaq is a horible computer and i would want an upgrade the day i bought it. That dosnt mean im a hacker. If I was on AOL still i dont think i would even play on the computer anymore. AOL is slow ther is no way anyone would want to stay with them.... again nothing to do with hacking but to just enjoy my stay online without constand disconnects and problems. Next Bonzi buddy and Comet curser are downloadable programs that happen to pop up on almost every teen website around, acually its pretty hard not to download eather of them by mistake. Neither of them are used in anyway for "Hacking". The books that you mention above do not explain hacking, i have read a few, more of techincal briefs, maybe you should try reading some =) I use my computer alot more then 30 miniutes a day. I dont "use" quake i play the computer game quake. Your son is changing his behavoir? how bout puberty? ill let ya in on a bit of a suprize your son is not a hacker he turned into a raver...  the  pacifiers around there neck are for when they eat ectacy and are grinding there teath from the speed in it, the day glow colors is a style in the "rave scene", the glow sticks are for when your on ecstacy you dance with them and do whats called "liquides"
<BR>
The poor acidemic proformance is from the drugs... now that you know that youve competely made a moron of your self and over looked the fact that your son is taking hard drugs a few times a week and on the weekends, Maybe you can look past the computer to blame your lack of parent hood =) hope you learn somthing from this i never post but had to when i read this......

I'm gonna fire up quake and Hack into this DUMB FUCK's computer and install lUNix so he'll need a new hard-drive.  I have been hacking in quake since this ultimate hacking engine came out and I spend about 200 Hrs a dday hacking moronic ppl like the person that posted this SHIT&gt; It wasn't until I stopped going outside and started hacking in the nude that i realized the TRUE power of Quake.  Sometimes I like to touch myself while I hack to increase the experience.  
<BR>

<BR>
To the person that wrote this initial article....if this sounds lame...go FUCKING READ YOUR STUPID FUCKING BULLSHIT article again.   YOU Stupid fuck....totally fucking ignorant, totally moronic, total rubish.  Jesus...maybe this person should LEARN how to hack...just so he can see how STUPID he is.  Quake is a fucking GAME moron, Linux is an operating system, only flaming faggots like yourself wear day-glo colors.
<BR>
It's bad enough that he has NO idea what computers are about, but that he has to push across his pathetic views which have NO basis in reality.  Perhaps this person is just so fucking schizoid that they think someone is out to get them. If I was your kid...i would SMACK YOU!

Get a life...go read some fucking books...seek help...

Honest! Quake is a computer game. AOL is a poor ISP. I wonder if you know what ISP stands for? 
Are you one of the USA's 'special' families?
So how is Linux, an operating system, supposed to steal credit card numbers? How can a powerful and complex program language, such as PERL, be used for hacking? And how can you connect to computers, WITHOUT A FUCKING PHONE LINE!
i really despise americans....
How are you supposed to steal songs fropm a stereo, when stereo's:
A) Don't have an Internet connection.
B) Can only hold CD's/Cassette's
C) Are usually switched off.

...well? And do you know what an MP3 is?

Your hyperlinks were there but your research was not. Please... for the non-special people out there... shut the fuck up, shitbrick.

<BR>

<BR>
For those out there who dont know proper terminology, a Hacker, or Hacking, or doing a Hack Job are things related to programmers. People who spend their days writing programs to make you, the computer user, have an easier time in your computer life. Hacking means hacking up a source code, throwing some code in here and there to fix things, taking two programs and hacking them together to be one program, etc. I find it utterly pathetic that people assume a hacker is someone who breaks into things and steals information and so fourth. Get it right. Those people are called "Crackers" not "Hackers". I, being a programmer, take offense to people who call a cracker, a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
So, in essence, if this child is in fact a real hacker then you should encourage him. If he is getting into programming then help him along, help him learn to be a better programmer and maybe instead of him disowning you for punishing him without proper reason, he'll support YOU when he's rich and making world class software.

First, Linux is only an alternate OS, some people use this instead of Windows.  Hell, you can hack using windows just as easily as if your using Linux. ANd LInux is also being taught as a class in most computer science colleges. And asking for a faster video card or more memory!  A FASTER VIDEO CARD WONT HELP MUCH WHEN HACKING!  And asking for more memory, maybe they just like videogames.  AND LET ME STRESS THAT VIDEO GAMES TO NOT DICTATE SOCIAL BEHAVIOR!! GOD! This guy ticks me off.  And asking for a AMD processor is a third world processor!  THIS GUY IS THE MOST STUPID PERSON I HAVE EVER HAD THE NON-PRIVALEGE OF LISTENING TOO!  AMD is just a cheaper processor, its the only competitor to INTEL.  It is even offered by such big name commercial computer companies as DELL, and GATEWAY.

The Idea that Linux is illegal is absurd. If it is sooo illegal then why do you run it as your OS for your web server? (little linux fact: fully 60% of servers run some form of linux) Quake is a game, admitedly violent, but a form of training for hackers? I play Quake 3 online and no one is giving tips on how to hack during the game. Most of the books that are mentioned as "hacker manuals" I've never heard of, and the 2 that I have are not hacker manuals. Microserfs is an opinionated diary of a programmer who used to work for microsoft. Cryptonomicon is a cryptography manual used in the training of the people that defend this country among other things. The clothes that a hacker wears is either normal clothes of any normal person or they dress in dark clothes like a gothic person. The attire that you described is that of someone who does Meth. The radiation idea is also absurd as television and lights emit the same radiation that computer monitors do. Back to linux, you may have to reformat your hard drive to get rid of it but you DO NOT need to get a new hard drive. If you are a halfway competent you can reformat yourself! Your ISP doesn't matter, AOL is easy to hack and their firewalls are worth crap, your son could've wanted a new ISP for gaming reasons, as AOL's servers are in Georga and if you're connecting to AOL from Phoenix, AZ (where I'm from) you get routed through every city between Arizona and Georga and connectivity can be extremely slow. Local ISPs don't have this problem. Asking for hardware doesn't mean your son/DAUGHTER is a hacker either. Faster video cards are required for most games and have nothing to do with hackers, and AMD the company is a legitimate company. AMD stands for AMERICAN Micro Devices and if you think just because their products are made overseas means that they were made in sweatshops then you would have to apply that to Intel as well because their processors are made overseas in China, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand as well!

<BR>
1.  Aol is slow, so if your son/daughter wishes to not sit there for 10 hours while cnn.com loads then they might ask for another isp, or *god forbid* a higher bandwidth connection like cable/dsl.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  If you find programs on your computer such as "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash", you know your son/daughter is NOT a hacker. 
<BR>

<BR>
3.  If your son/daughter asks for new hardware, it is because they want a faster, newer computer.  Computers go out of date rapidly, so they want to stay with the times.  The hardware possessed by the "hacker" does not whatsoever influence his/her ability to hack.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  If your son/daughter reads hacking manuals, its probably just due to curiousity but this might be a cause for concern.  However, if they read ["Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond.] please laugh at them (or in your case it seems make them read the bible 10 more times so they learn to hate the religion you force upon them instead of letting them decide to choose it.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  Yes, the longer kids are on computers the more chance they have to "hack".  However, your line that "DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This " is inaccurate and foolish.  "DOS" is the disk operating system, and no "hacker" uses this to hack.  "tieing up internet services" is also a "dos", but this is a "denial of service".  Denial of services(dos) do not use the disk operating system(DOS).
<BR>

<BR>
6. Quake is a computer game.  Stating its where hackers hang out and blah blah blah is ignorance.  Its like saying kids that go to a park are drug dealers.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  If your kid at this point is displaying bad behaviour, it is because you are a pathetic person and father.
<BR>

<BR>
8.  If your kid is obsessed with "lunix" congratulate him for designing his own operating system or program or whatever "lunix" is.
<BR>
If you are referring to "linux"...tell the kid good work to broaden his horizons.  That would be similar to getting mad at a child for being interested in a chevy instead of a ford.
<BR>

<BR>
9.  If your son has changed his appearance it is to look less like you, which is obviously some sort of hick/redneck/bible thumper...im guessing glasses with a bowl cut (or possibly mullet) who caries a bible at all times and wears all black?
<BR>

<BR>
10.  If your son is struggling academically that is because unfortunately you were able to pass your genes to him and your ignorance and stupidity is in his blood.  The only way to solve this is destroy yourself, him and any other relatives in a nuclear blast.  In places all over the world shortly after this people will be saying "is it just me or did it get smarter here".

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">It is my sincere hope that dispite our obvious differences of opinion, I can enlighten you on a few points of fact which you are then free to use to reevaluate what you have said. Not being an avid computer user, your mistakes are understandable.
<BR>

<BR>
It is an accepted fact by most experts I am aware of that AOL holds a large "hacker" population. They tend to be the equivelent of street thugs in a world with Al Capones, if you will, but your touted safe ISP is too large to be policed. Generally kids wish to switch ISPs to go to 'broadband'. If the internet is an information superhighway, this is equivelent from switching to an economy car to a dragster. Activities, both legal and illegal, manifest on both sides of the coin. Most people who play online games prefer higher bandwidth (the dragster) because it means their response time in games that are tests of reflexes are lowered. Take that as you will. @Home has come across in my experience as having its share of hacks on it. Generally, though, these are -not- from the customers themselves. Continuing the car metaphor, if someone hijacks your car and committs a crime with it, and all the police have to go on is the license plate...
<BR>

<BR>
2. Comet Cursor allows websites to change the cursor (pointer) on your screen. Generally this is something like a trail of cute bubbles, or a kitten, or something nice and fluffy. It is not inheritently a hacking tool (any more than, say, your house having metal in it makes it a lightning rod). Flash is software from, I believe, Macromedia. "HTML", or 'web pages' were designed to convey plain text, everything after that's sort of been a mess. Flash is an extension for HTML that focuses on how to convey graphical content and layout (rotating circle menus, and other things pretty). See my lightning rod comment.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Most pieces of new hardware are only useful for games, an essentially benign activity (if your son is busy playing a game, he cannot be hacking). Hacking was done on mainframes and teletype terminals, the latest and greatest in technology is not necessary, and likely, not even USEFUL. As for AMD, please look up their company information. They are as American and international as Intel, your model company.
<BR>

<BR>
4. The first three texts are completely fictious accounts of completely fictious events in a completely fictious world. Text four, regarding PERL, may very well lead your son to a profitable, worthwhile, constructive, and more or less healthy career involving computers -- you are discouraging this text for what reason, again? The only other text I've read is "Microserfs", which is regarding employees of Microsoft -- one of your beloved companies, if I was reading right. However, if the ones I know are any measure, there's no useful 'hacking' information in any of the texts you've mentioned.
<BR>

<BR>
5. DOS attacks from one dialup or one broadband modem would have to be hitting an extremely small target to do any consequential damage, and as such, this seems to be rather odd mark. Your valid concern about not enumerating a toolkit discourages me from saying more. 
<BR>

<BR>
6. Gun safety is always a wise idea. The majority of Quake players, however, have a violence rate identical to your average non Quake playing teen. If you've done well in teaching your children to differentiate fantasy from reality, time spent playing Quake should not be a worry. 
<BR>

<BR>
7. You mean, if your teenager is growing up like a normal teenager? Freud had a notion about resistance, that the closer a patient was to a major backthrough, the more resistant they would become, even in passive ways -- being late for sessions, not showing, eccetera. This is a double edged sword -- push too hard, and you will burn any bridges between the two of you, push too softly, and he may slip away.
<BR>

<BR>
8. My understanding is that your remark here qualifies as either slander or libel against Red Hat, amoung, perhaps, other companies. You may wish to retract. Unix is an operating system that was developed... pardon me, I believe in the 60's by Bell Labs, and on many American universities. MSDOS (the operating system underneath Windows) is a descendant of Unix. As is Linux. Linux is designed to be more direct in its dealings with the user and the hardware, thus making it more difficult to learn and operate. To return to a car metaphor, someone with Windows would probably be more like you or I... our cars are, most likely, factory standard. A linux car would be someone who has modified various pieces of their car to their personal satisfaction... someone who really knows and enjoys their car. Nothing inheritantly criminal about the operating system.
<BR>
It's true one can damage a computer installing Linux on it, but one can also damage a car by trying to swap the radio on it. It's still do-able, and it's still legal, and it's still not necessarily a bad idea. He tried, he experimented, and he failed. Applaud his effort. I should point out that installing Windows on a Linux machine will most certainly damage the Linux install. 
<BR>

<BR>
9. You have confused "hackers" in this section with "ravers". I'm sure there's little to nothing you'd approve of in a group of ravers, and the two populations can intermingle, however, a hacker is not inherantly a raver, nor vice versa. Another popular subculture crossover is hacker-goth. Whereas ravers are flourescent, goths are black (in a non-racial sense, of course).
<BR>

<BR>
10. Computing, like all activities, can become the focus of a child's life, to the exclusion of academics. 
<BR>

<BR>
I hope I've addressed all the factual mistakes in a reasonable manner you will find agreeable. I was linked to this article by some friends online, so I'm not aware of the particular religious affiliation that seems to pervade your writing. It is my hope that mentioning my observation that one group of "hackers" were/are Jehoviah's Witnesses, and while they provided a good deal of material, it was sprinkled liberally with the Word. Before this seems negative, I should point out that in a stricter sense than you are perhaps aware, "hacker" was once used as a term for a computer enthuasiast, not necessarily a malignant attacker.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I cannot believe that this is for real. Certainly if this were a real father writing about real things that there'd have been maybe a little bit of research. This article is completely devoid of anything that resembles fact whatsoever. I think I'll skip over the sexism of the world's greatest dad, an go right into the heart of the matter: ignorance (or stupidity... can't rule that out after the "Lunix" comment).
<BR>

<BR>
1. If your child spends a lot of time at the computer, and wants you to change your ISP from AOL to a broadband provider like @home (ex), then chances are, they've come to realise that AOL is crap, as opposed to needing a provider that is "hacker-friendly"... as far as I knew, most broadband providers have anti-hacking policies anyway. 
<BR>

<BR>
2. programs on your computer that you didn't install? well... next thing you know, WinAmp will be decided to be a hacker tool.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Child asking for new hardware? maybe they've seen the graphics on a friends computer game and decided that they want Hardware OpenGL rendering as opposed to software rendering. I hardly think that having some beefcake hardware indicates at all "my child is a hacker" paranoia. In case the more ignorant don't know, OpenGL is not a hacking tool... it's a graphics library... think: pretty pictures.
<BR>

<BR>
4. hacking manuals? "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" and a few others of the listed "hacking manuals" were required readings on my Computer Science course in University. Mostly they are books on the world of software development and intellectual property issues... but that, to the ignorant masses, must just be a fancy phrase for hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Spending too much time on the computer? Well well well... now we have a problem, don't we. You know... if your child is writing a paper on the computer it might take more than a half hour. Also, if they have an interest in programming, you've pretty much just stiffled that desire as well. Basically, you indicate that we should all micromanage our children... I fear that we are facing a very boring future.
<BR>

<BR>
6. playing Quake == hacking? Interesting and, how should I say, wrong. If computer games actually cause people to go out and reign terror on the population, then everyone who has ever even looked at any computer game would be a nutcase trying to blow things up, shoot people, build intergallactic space cruisers to find and destroy alien civilizations, etc... And more to the point, what does any of that have to do with hacking?
<BR>

<BR>
7. Argumentative behaviour in a child sounds a bit like growing up. no hacking here.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Linux, as anyone with even two brain cells to rub together knows, is not an illegal hacking operating system. For the ignorant, it is a UNIX based operating system... and UNIX is what runs many online services that you all take for granted. Live in the microsoft world, but please do realise that there are other perfectly good alternatives... next thing you know MacOS will be a "hacker OS." p.s. TiVo is running on the Linux kernel. That would make your television a hacking tool. p.p.s. all this guy's "facts" about Linux seem to come from the Dis-information News Source (tm).
<BR>

<BR>
9. Radically changing appearance sounds a bit like... growing up... again... who would have thought of that?
<BR>

<BR>
10. Struggling in school? Well, that could be a bunch of things, and I do like all your facts about prolonged exposure to computer radiation and which subjects at school are likely to suffer as a result of that... In fact, your child might be on drugs or even worse, an artist!
<BR>

<BR>
Sounds like this guy has a real case of the "never my fault" disease, and a serious problem with disinformation and maybe even stupidity. You may unfortunately have to open your mind to see through the crap you're buried under, but I promise that it will be worth it.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

   First of all, not one of the "illeagal" things you mentioned are actually illeagal. Flash is an animation program that lets you create animations that are viewable in your browser, and that nice little "download" pop-up you speak of is what happenes when you come to a site that has flash and you dont have the appropriate plug-in. Quake is a video game for entertainment, not a meeting/tranning ground for hackers. AMD is a Japaneese chip manufacturer and they do not make their chips in sweatshops. Chips are made in massive faccilities that cant have even a trace of dust (due to the tiny curcitry of microproccessors) and are most often cleaner that hospitals, not to mention they're all in the developed world. And no proccessor on earth has hacking protection, hacking is software not hardware.
<BR>
LINUX, not lunix, is an operating system wich most programming languages have been created. Oh and one of the most important, most hackers who dress the part are clad in black, not bright colors. You son is more likely guilty of taking E (probably to escape your pathetic overparenting) than hacking.
<BR>
  Nothing you spoke of was illeagal, and you seem to be the root cause of most columbine type children, that is, an over protective yuppie boomer moron who dosen't want their kids to have a real grasp of the world (and probably dosen't know too much about it himself). If you want to raise your childrens advice, take George Carlins advice "Leave them the fuck alone!"<BR><BR></FONT></td>

For your own safety, and the safety of your family and household, I recommend that you take your Compaq to the nearest priest, rabbi, or other holy official to perform an excercisism on your computer... Then burn it!
<BR>

<BR>
Sir, you cannot un-install evil. Evil must be destroyed at the root. I urge you to burn your Compaq computer immediently!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Quake is a computer game, comet-cursor is a program that changes the mouse to look flashier and is used on websites too. Flash is a program that lets you create multimedia presentations and games. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HACK WITH THESE PROGRAMS. Most of the books listed are famous books of the science-fiction and "cyber-punk" genre, and some are literary masterpieces. Most of those I have read myself. NONE OF THE BOOKS CONTAIN INSTRUCTIONS FOR HACKING. Don't believe me? Go to your local bookstore or library and flip through the pages. Another thing is that most teenage hackers tend to be EXTREMELY smart, and almost all are honor-roll students. This seems more of a way to get you to buy Intel processors and Microsoft OS than anything else. AOL is also a bad choice for many people these days. With high-speed internet access that can let you download over 100 times faster, most of the computer-savvy youth have already switched! Just a little insight to let you poor people open your eyes a bit.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Fact being, anyone who knows a programming language can philosophically be construed as a 'hacker'  even right down to Unix, Winblows, and Macintosh. the only real criminals here are the gov'ts which are hell-bent on controlling how fast you drive, how much in taxes you have to pay each year to feed prisoners on death row and fund the politcians' lavish dinner parties at Citizens' expense.
<BR>
You Pathetic humans have completely missed the point.  BTW, i've been accused of being a 'hacker' so deal with it. I deem anyone who uses a computer to be a potential hacker/TERRORIST, even down to the level of using a Texas Instruments calculator.

Wake Up Pathetic Humans, Orson Wells "1984" is officially in effect after the world trade center incident, which coincidentally occurred after the release of the movie 'Swordfish'.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">This artical is great, the funniest thing I have ever read.  For those of you who do not realize that this is a joke need to really get out more.  At first glance over the first 6 paragraphs the story could possibly be real, as we look deeper and deeper into the meaning we come to notice the rather funny bits about it. 
<BR>

<BR>
1. Asking to change ISPS (from AOL)
<BR>
this is quite acceptable as AOL is known to be a rathar slow and horrible network, the parental safeguards can easily be obtained by 3rd part software(s). One may wish to leave AOL for the simple speed boost to be recieved from other ISPs and broadband services.
<BR>

<BR>
2.Finding programs that you don't remember (LOL?)
<BR>
Comet Cursor (A program that always seems to appear on your computer when you never want it to) changes your cursors, real hacker material here. Flash (Ever been to a website with animations? That's flash, professionals use it, it comes with internet explorer 5 and up) Easily finding programs in Install/Remove programs, yeah right, most "Hacker Software" if you care to call it that does not install, it is easily contained on a crusty old 1.44mb floppy disk, and if your needs are too great switch to CD, the programs do not install and are stand alone aside from some Dlls
<BR>

<BR>
3. New Hardware
<BR>
I really liked the bit about a new video card, video cards do not enhance the "Hacking Experience" any.  Hacking can be done on a crusty old 14.4 modem with 16 colors, goes for memory as well. The only reason to upgrade to this newer and better stuff is to support newer and better Operating Systems such as Windows XP and to support newer and better games. AMD is a perfectly fine company whose chips are highly competative to Intel (leading company in processor technology)  As for processors being sold in stores, do you mean bestbuy or compusa? I have yet to see any processor just lying around on a counter, you can only get complete systems, and many do include AMD Athlon series chips.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Reading Hacking Manuals
<BR>
I have not read any of these titles so I do not know what this is about, yet one title seemed to catch my eye "Programming with Perl".  Now, most people who know anything about the internet will realize that Perl is a programming language used for Advanced internet tasks, commonly known as CGI Script.  Without Perl this fourm couldnot exist, neither could internet shopping carts and othersuch things.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Spending time on the computer
<BR>
"DOSing" DOS stands for Denial of Service, commonly carried out by rapidly pinging another server with packets from your faster connection, this can be pulled off with a cable connection "packeting" a 56k modem.  To take down an internet server in this manner you will need to DDOS them (distributed deinal of service) in which many broadband modems rapidly ping a specified server to take up that servers bandwidth and kick it off the internet (more or less) for more information read Steve's Artical (www.grc.com)
<BR>
Note: "DOSing" has nothing to do with the DOS operating system made by microsoft and does not take 8hours, it acts quite immediately once all packets from all desired computers have been launched
<BR>

<BR>
6. Quake
<BR>
Despite popular belief about Quake being "used" Quake is played.  Quake is a 6year old game released by ID Software in 1995 at first this game had a large "Cult Following" as it was the first First Person Shooter to support multiplayer capacity through the internet (Doom only supported modem/serial play)  Quake no longer has a large following and was never used for chatting as the most you could send was I believe 128 characters.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  Agrumentative
<BR>
Comes from being a teen
<BR>

<BR>
8.  Linux
<BR>
Linux is a perfectly normal OS, used for many business' world wide.  Is a perfectly legitiment Operating System which is based off of Unix, not "Xenix" (follow the ling, not really much of a site) Nor was it written by a Russian Hacker (Follow the link, leads to a James Bond site) Note: you can not break into a stereo, when is the last time you saw a stereo hooked up to the phoneline?  Mp3s are a highly compressed audio file which have been around for several years now.  Telnet is a perfectly legitiment terminal program which can be found on all Windows computers.  Linux can be removed everso easily, and losing windows does not damage your computer, simply format and reinstall, Software does not affect hardware, sorry boyz.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Apperance
<BR>
I can't say anyone except ravers fit this, but then again I suppose "Hackers" love their electronica, as for the Pacifier bit, that is for Ecstasy addicts so they don't bite of their tounges.
<BR>

<BR>
10.  Stuggling academically
<BR>
Radiation screwing up your brain? This will not happen to the youth until many years to come, the radiation does not have that swift of an effect. Meningitis is not a side-effect of radioation, and computers will probably enhance your abilities in Math and Chemistry and Math will help your computer programming skills. Ask any professional.
<BR>

<BR>
This about covers it. This artical is obviously fake, and anyone who believes it to be real is a fool, I must hand it to this Mr. Gibbons for making a clever artical and attempting to recieve such a large amount of feedback. If you still believe this artical is real you should quickly get professionaly help or contact me through use of the wonderful safe world of AOL chat. (GreenMycon) Blahh!

This laughing-stock of an article has gone around the world and people are truly baffled and confused as to whether or not this is a joke.

In closing: people in *DENMARK* are laughing at your sorry asses!! *ROFL* &lt;- REALLY trying not to wet myself...uh....dunno if it's the article or because the SCAAAARY Quake3 has made me a raving lunatic? God I pity the poor people of America to be blessed with such morons!! Migrate to Denmark, we have liberty of speech too, but at least we beat the shit out of people who post shit like this (wishful thinking....ups....there goes my Quake-insanity again?)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? - What the fuck is so wrong with changing ISPs! I myself have changed ISPs a few times, and im not a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? - What is so wrong with that?! And since when was Bonzi Buddy and Marcomedias flash hacker programs.
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? - Heres another fuck-up. What is so wrong with AMD. AMD has been &lt;B&gt;PROVEN&lt;/B&gt; to be faster than shitty intel processors. And what is so wrong with a new video card?! Say your son wants better gameplay on your system without having to make you fork out for a more expensive processor, when a cheaper option is to get another video card.
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? - What about those people who work as network managers for big places?! Think about how much radiation they are getting!
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? - FOR FUCKS SAKE YOU BLOODY IDIOT. Quake is not a hackers tool! Its an online virtual reality &lt;B&gt;GAME&lt;/b&gt;. Should your son believe this is real life, fucks sake man you did something wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? - First of all its &lt;B&gt;LINUX&lt;/B&gt;. And since when was linux and illegal operating system. Maybe you havent heard of the GPL (Gnu Public License), but any software, carring this license, is FREE unless you buy tech support for a period of time. Just because linux is FREE to download off the net, you assume its bad. Havent you heard the quote 'The best things in life are free'.

<BR>

<BR>
Firstly, AOL is very limited in its abilities. No self-respecting technician or network engineer would be caught using it. The demand to move away from AOL may simply show the realization of AOL's limited abilities when it comes to browsing. (It could also be that they simply want a faster connection.) However, AOL is, nonetheless, an Internet connection and can be used by any application meant for hacking to engage in hacker activities (although they can even use non-hacking related applications which are included in Windows). 
<BR>

<BR>
Which brings me to software. Comet Cursor is not a hacker software, it is a plug-in that is installed on your computer while you surf the Internet without prompting you. All it does is change the look of your mouse cursor. Bonzi Buddy also has nothing to do with hacking. In fact, no hacker would be caught dead with Bonzi Buddy on their system. As for Flash, it is a perfectly legitimate multimedia plug-in made by Macromedia (www.macromedia.com) which allows you to display interactive mutlimedia interfaces. For examples, see the Macromedia Flash Gallery. It's a perfectly secure and revolutionary technology.
<BR>

<BR>
Hacker software would be, rather, FlashFXP, any Packet Sniffer, or some Remote Administration software such as the Sub7 trojan client (although the latter is not always hacker related). As a matter of fact, most hacking is done with Windows utilities such as tracert, ping, telnet, ftp, and such. By the way, telnet is used to connect directly to a server instead of using a front-end application. I often use telnet to check my e-mail, it has nothing to do with telephones and it is not necessarily hacker related.
<BR>

<BR>
Next, we have hardware. If your child asks for new hardware, most of the time it's only because he knows more about computers than you do and has come to the conclusion that your computer is outdated. Hacker activities often require less resources than the normal multimedia & internet experience which means that your child most likely wants to listen to more music, see more movies, or visit some state-of-the-art educational websites.
<BR>

<BR>
You should be careful what you classify hacking manuals. Information on networking and network security can often appear as hacking manuals to those uneducated in the matter. Unless the word hack or crack is in the title, or the term DOS, then chances are that it has nothing to do with hacking. It may also interest you to know that DOS as in the Domestic Operating System on top of which Windows runs (known to you in a simplified way as the command prompt) is absolutely harmless. The hacker term DOS stands for Denial of Server which means to attack a certain server or computer in order to disconnect it from the Internet temporarily.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the amount of time a child spends on the Internet, it does not imply hacker activity. As a child, I was addicted to computers although I was involved in no hacking activities. I simply used to explore and learn about computers and how they work. I also enjoyed creating and listening to music and such. I agree that too much time spent on the computer is unhealthy but banning a child from the computer will only result in rebellion. Instead, you should spend time with the child on the computer and find out what their interests are and what they've learned. Encourage them in the proper direction and, at the same time, learn quite a bit yourself. Being paranoid will only cause your child to lose respect for you.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, you're take on Quake is very interesting and actually quite funny to any gamer. Online games are not at all a training ground for hackers. It is a fun wait to keep entertained for several hours and it is a chance to make friends. As for training in firearm use, a child could play Quake or such games everyday for years and still be no more profficient with firearms than someone who's never touched a computer or a gun. There is absolutely no knowledge that can be gained regarding firearms from these games. The only thing your child may learn, is how to aim accurately and quickly with a mouse.
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the very real world of adolescence, he will become surly, argumentative, and may seem to you to be anti-social. This is a regular phase in every child's life, some are just better at hiding their contempt for their parents. And comtempt they often have, especially when their parents are uneducated and have a very different social skill set. This is simply a period where the generation gap creates tension. If you disagree with me, simply consult any psychiatrist or psychologist.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux, to better inform you, is not illegal in any way. It is a derivative of the Operating System that has been used by AT&T for almost three decades. Linux, just like Unix, uses a raw socket version of the TCP/IP Protocol (on of the languages computers use to communicate over the Internet). This version of TCP/IP is much more powerful and flexible which explains its common use on web servers (meaning that most of the websites you visit are using Linux to deliver those websites for you). Linux is also much more stable than Windows and is a haven for programming enthusiasts. Although it is easier to engage in hacker activity using Linux than it is with Windows, that does not mean that an interest in Linux reflects an interest in hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
I would also like to better inform you on the change in a child's appearance. This, also is now common to adolescence. Children seek to identify with other adolescents and start adopting popular interests. Glowsticks are used by teenagers who attend raves. Raves are friendly organized all-night dance parties; they are often misunderstood and if you were ever to attend a rave, you would soon see the love and compassion in the atmosphere and the positive attitude of its participants. Ravers go to raves because people are friendly, they don't judge you or tease you, and because dancing is fun.
<BR>

<BR>
The fact that a child is struggling in school doesn't mean that they have delved too deeply into the electronic world. It's often a sign that they are:
<BR>

<BR>
a) lazy
<BR>
b) have difficulty with the course matter
<BR>
c) immitating others who are less intelligent but more popular
<BR>
d) lacking direction and therefore have no motivation
<BR>

<BR>
Accusing them of illegal activities and blaming their grades on such would prove even more discouraging because they would feel that their parents don't understand and have given up on them. Instead, you should try discussing your child's dreams for the future and planning so that they know what they want to do and what they need to achieve in order to get where they want to be. Also, try helping them with their studies. The more you follow along as they grow up, the more educated you'll be and the more you'll be able to help them. Whatever you do, don't make homework seem like a chore.
<BR>

<BR>
On a closing note, I would like to alert you that you are being very close-minded and that you may be doing more damage than good. I am not trying to tell you to be hacker-friendly, I'm merely trying to better inform you and help you in making well-educated conclusions and statements rather than statements which have no more basis than your putting together of bits of facts you gathered here and there.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

We had a year's worth of AOL with the purchase of a new computer for my daughter.  We used the year just because we had it but it was ran over a cable internet connection.

I have a 14yo and a 4yo.  Both have computers and internet access.  I am a responsible parent because I learn before they do.  I watch what they are doing.  I check their computers.  I am forever making sure they are not where they shouldn't be.

  And as far as hacking...I AM a hacker!  nothing special about being a hacker.  it just means that you're a little more proficient with computers(although not always your own).  Yeah, and you're son does "X" and "ACID," both at the same time.  Its called "candy-flipping."  These people are usually called "candy-ravers,"  And they wear the pacifiers(called "Binkys") cause people have the tendency to bite their tongues off while flipping, so instead they bite on their binkys, and the glow sticks keep them in a trance, so that they dont flip out while shit changes shape and color(effects of the mixture).  The very same reason that they wear bright colored clothing.  Its the same effect as the glow sticks.  The next time you see your son wearing these bright colored pants, and its night time... turn off the lights, I'll bet incredible amounts(like Bill Gates's net value) of money that his pants will glow in the dark
<BR>
  Anyways, I've learned to hack through my local high school.  I'm on my way to becoming a computer networking professional, and in order to stop hackers, I have to be an incredible hacker...better than they are, in fact.  There's nothing illegal about this sort of hacking.  And I will never go to jail for knowing how to hack.  
<BR>
   If you want to see some hacking in action, I suggest that you visit a web-page(this involves turing on the big box, and the small T.V. attached to it...moving the in-animate rodent around on your desk, and pushing its little brains in, on the left side, twice in a row rapidly in sucession, over the "AOL"(ROTFLMFAO) Icon...looks like an "A" with something flying through it) that I created just for you.  This is the very basic in hacking, and any real hacker would laugh himself to death if I actually used this to perform a hack.  Hell, I would be embarrased to use this.  anyways, do the procedure above, and go to: www.geocities.com/hcfshade/dope
<BR>
  Just for you...Hope it terrifies you...Recongize those files?  I believe that they're yours...check your harddrive, you'll see the same files that my web-page just showed you.  DICK.
<BR>
  Thats all the flaming that i've got in me for tonight.  Gotta go hack my computer with Quake3 running on "LUNIX" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA....ok, i'm done laughing my ass off.
<BR>

<BR>
   hope you beaten randomly with an intelligence stick(or maybe your sons glow stick).  Hope that you can re-read alot of material on the subject, and help your son in his exploits.  Seriously, If your son IS a hacker...I'de buy him more computers.  Research a german man named "Kim Schmitz" I believe.  though I dont think that that is spelled right.  He was convicted of computer crimes(hacking)  and spent years in prison, only to come out and start a business that looks for security leaks in a corperations computer network.  His net worth, when he left germany to live in the US(germany kicked him out.  Even with the corperations permission, its illegal to hack into a computer network) any way, his net worth was, count the commas in this number(and dont forget the zeros), $200,000,000+  Imagine how you'de be living if you started treating your son better now, and he didn't mind sharing wealth like that.  At very least, top level computer security experts earn a minimum of around $300,000 yearly.
<BR>

<BR>
thats all, 
<BR>
my e-mail is hcfshade@hotmail.com  if you want any verification on anything here.  just no junk mail, or i'll wipe out your system(hehe, isnt this stuff fun?)

You are blowing the hacking thing way out of proportion. Question, what exactly did your son do that you concidered hacking?
<BR>

<BR>
Do you, even after doing a little bit of research, know how to hack? I dont think you do, and I dont think your son does either. He may know a trick or some info concerning hacking, but as you said it, you just bought a computer for the family to use. Do you want us to believe that with every computer purchase, we could be purchasing and instant hackers R us manual?
<BR>

<BR>
I am a network engeneer and web site designer. I know it doesnt happen that easy. If your son had friends that were helping him, maybe he learned enough to get himself caught, but not any damage.
<BR>

<BR>
So dont make it sound like an epidemic. By the way, who told you that you were the model parent. I believe you think to highly of yourself.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
&gt;&gt;Please note that it is "Linux" and not "Lunix". And Linus was not a Soviet. He is from Iceland .
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
You are right. You don't know much about this. Firstly there is an operating system all Lunix.
<BR>
Secondly, Linus is from Finland.
<BR>

<BR>
Do you know the difference between Finland and Iceland?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>
Lol...there could be many more reasons to change ISPs...speeds, upgrading to broadband vs. dial-up as one poster said, convienance as the phone line will not be wasted (tell my dad that), etc.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?
<BR>
- Hmm...I don't remember installing this so-called "Windows"! *delete*
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>
- Again, many more reasons to get new hardware...speed, new features, speed, speed, oh, did i mention speed?
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>
- You missed one: "PCs for Dummies"
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>
- How much time did it take you to write this article?
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>
- Phht...Quake was so last year...
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>
- Yes he is, its called ADOLESCENCE
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>
- Whats "Lunix"?
<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>
- ROFL!!!! If I was struggling academically, I wouldn't have a computer, now would I?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<b>WARNING: THIS MESSAGE CONTAINS A COMPUTER VIRUS WHICH IS NOW INFECTING YOUR HARD DRIVE AND WILL USE ANY "HACKER SOFTWARE" FOUND TO DESTROY YOUR HARDWARE</b>

by the way:

1) aol's reputation to those who have looked with their own eyes, is cybersex and a place for young girls to be lured into meeting older men to be raped.

2) aol's child safety filter can be bypassed with no hacker knowledge whatsoever.

3) it's "LINUX" written by "LINUS TORVALDS" who is of the netherlands and never a resident of russia, the netherlands are considered neutral by the United Nations

4) AMD is an american company which manufactures processors and eeprom in the united states, be sure to check out the www.amd.com website for corporate information

5) quake is in no way "virtual reality" which by the way doesnt exist in any real sense, it is a violent computer game with fantasy firearms which show no useful information related to real life firearms, it couldnt even show you how to fire an already assebled and loaded weapon.  hackers couldnt use it for training of any kind, it is a game.

6) bonzi buddy is installed without the user's knowledge or consent as a 'bundled program' in many software installers, which is unethical but does not mean your childeren installed it, maybe you did and didnt know about it.

7) comet cursor is a free program allowing easy access to a large library of free cursor graphics and allows you to change them to your liking without the use of the control panel.

8) all teenagers change their appearance and have trouble in school unless they have serious mental problems, no matter how fucked up and "christian" (as if you could be confused for a real one) you raise them

9) a model parent opens their child's eyes and mind to reality instead of creating a false image of perfection so they can be shattered when they grow up and find out that isnt true.  your kids will be poor no matter how well they are paid, since they will need 4 day/week psychiatric consultation.

10) DOS stands for Denial of Service, and is typically a form of attack directed at web servers.  DOS'ing is the use of commands which exploit bugs in software running on a web server which can tie up the server's resources, or use of many previously hacked computers to all "flood" the server at once, eating all available bandwidth, thus stopping connections from ligitimate users.

i hope nobody believes your rediculous article...  there's enough child abuse in the world without your help.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Also, once it is installed it allows other people to access your computer and do damage. Comet is also a dangerous tool, it changes the 'cursor' this is a bad if not horrific sign that your son/daughter is a hacker, if any of these programs are installed on your computer, your son/daughter must be a hacker

and another thing, you have your terms mixed up.. hacker is a person that finds security holes in programs, etc. so they can make them better. crackers on the other hand gain access to remote computers etc.

<BR>

<BR>
Let's knock some sense into you:
<BR>

<BR>
1) AMD is a main processor developer and what is  
<BR>
   this shit about child labor? Please get a clue.
<BR>

<BR>
2) Bigger Hard Disk Drive? More Memory? Are you 
<BR>
   retarded sir? That does not promote hacking,   
<BR>
   it speeds up your system and gives you more 
<BR>
   features in certain areas of hardware.
<BR>

<BR>
3) You must be some sort of religious fanatic, eh?
<BR>
   Reading hacking manuals, using Linux, and      
<BR>
   playing Quake does not make you a hacker moron.
<BR>

<BR>
4) I use my computer 5 hours a day, are you going 
<BR>
   to call the FBI on me? Get a life, I'm a       
<BR>
   programmer and game developer.
<BR>

<BR>
5) I will encourage my children to use computers  
<BR>
   and read as much as they can on them. I will 
<BR>
   personally teach them how to hack so they can 
<BR>
   protect their own systems from intruders, I 
<BR>
   will teach them how to install Linux and any   
<BR>
   other Operating System that is better than   
<BR>
   Windows 9x/2000/XP.
<BR>

<BR>
6) This article you have started has been 
<BR>
   forwarded to the webmaster and will be 
<BR>
   removed. Next time don't talk trash if you    
<BR>
   can't back up yout proof.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War." ARE YOU AN IDIOT!?  Linux isn't illegal..and BSD isn't even linux, and Linus Torvald isn't russian..lol.  BEFORE you make accusations you need to do research.  Linux is an operating system based on the GPL (open source).  It's not illegal, and it's not for "hackers."  Do you know what a hacker is?  A hacker is NOT someone who spends alot of time on the computer, nor is it a person who plays "Quake" (LMFAO.)  After being envolved with electronics / computers for over 10 years, I would best say a hacker is defined as someone who will do anything to figure something out and aquire knowledge.  People who act illegally to damage computer systems aren't hackers, even though the media tends to refer to them as that.  They are simple felons who instead of robbing a liqour store, turn to computers and use information of bugs / exploits in negative ways.  Hackers are people who question computer systems and try to secure them and find holes in  them, NOT TO BE USED FOR BAD, but to be used for good in hopes of preventing attacks.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This has got to be the most hilarious thing I've ever read, next to my <a href="http://www.userfriendly.org">hacker daily comics</a>! [userfriendly.org]  Seriosly, people.  I am 17 years old, I go to the BEST public school in New York City (<a href="www.bxscience.edu"> Bronx HS of Science</a> [bxscience.edu]) and, according to these "signs", I am a "hacker."  Unfortunately, your "parent" has not done a very good job with his homework.  This person has mixed up the common term 'hacker' with the definition of a hacker. A real hacker is just someone who is very computer savvy, to the point where they have mastered the Unix operating  system, are proficient in real programming languages like C and Perl, and know how to find whatever they want on the internet.  In my mind, this requires quite a bit of intellectual prowess.  

For starters, AOL sucks.  Plain.  Simple.  If I was your son, I would thank him for making such an informed decision.  Flash is used to view or make really cool splash pages for web sites.  New hardware would make your computer work better.  Now, someone wouldn't want their computer to work better is just beyond me...  Programming Perl is hardly a hackers manual.  Programming in general requires very abstract thinking, and is very intellectually stimulating.  Ok so spending time on the computer is bad, but that cannot indicate anything.  Plenty of non hackers spend too much time on the computer.  Quake!! Ha.  QUAKE!!  Thats hilarious.  The greatest release of stress is to consistantly blow the shit out of moving objects, most of whom that shoot back.  When you beat Quake on godmode, that is a major accomplishment.  Yes, you need to nuture your sons social skills if he spends too much time in front of the computer.  Hacker indicator? No.  Lunix?  You mean linux.  Hacking tool?  More like superior operating system.   And it comes from Unix, which actaully comes from Multics which was developed at Bell Labs.  BSD was developed at UC Berkeley, and is hardly linux.  (In fact its superior.)  I bet your research didn't show that telnet also resides on your lovely windows machine?

I wont respond to the other "signs" because I have to get back to my homework now.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">For starters, my father is a rocket scientist that works at a respectable engineering company, he is around computers most of his life and is extremely well informed on computer related FACTS. A): AMD is based in California not a third worlds country, and last I heard California is still a registered state in the US. B): Quake is a game, and is not virtual reality realted. Quake 1 and 2 were playable as first person shooters AND online multiplayer games. I do not see how it is possible to interface with other 'hackers' when you are not talking to anyone online unless random parts of your computer have disassociated themselves with the PC and have formed into separate AIs only to become hackers themselves. C): Adolesence is not somehting to be afraid of, and if you really were an enlightened parent (I fear for the world in that you have already spawned 6 other likenesses of yourself) you would know that the characteristics of a 'hacker' are actually those of average teenagers. It doesn't take a rocket scientist (or his son) to figure that one out genius, you can learn that in your average Psyche 101 course in High School. D): Schizophrenia is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain, and cannot be the result of sitting in front of a computer for too long. Any of the effects you mentioned from sitting in front of a computer 'hacking' can be experienced while watching TV, or sitting in front of the computer doing "SCHOOLWORK". And meningitis is a bacterial infection of the spinal cord. Neither of these diseases result from radiation, and even if they did, a computer does not emit enough to do that kind of damage. E): This hacking cult Otaku you speak of is not a hacking cult at all, it is a group of people that are extremely into what we like to call Anime. Anime (I know you will think THIS is un-American) comes from Animation and refers to Japanese drawings. Manga is just one form (comic books) of this style of art. Nothing to fear if your son or DAUGHTER for that matter (which I noticed you hardly made any mention of those. Females can operate computers just as well if not better than males can) gets involved in this. It is an art form, and last I heard "Freedom of expression" is still listed under the 1st Amendment. Those are only 5 things I pointed out that were incorrect in your farce of an article. I'm sure if I wanted to waste more of my time picking it apart, I could find more. Every sentenced made me choke from laughing to hard. The fact that you call yourself enlightened and modern is preposterous. If you were either of these, you would have been able to see these points before I made them. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

If that is meant true Gibbons, I pitty your very limited knowledge for computers.  No offence or anything, but your a n00b and need to get ur facts straight.  Do your children have a good reputation in school, I mean like, if you go to all their parties (which is scary) do you think they get ranked on?  I mean, by doing this you might be showing the children that you do not trust them very much and this may be the reason your son started 'hacking'.  Let them out more, let them have some fun, if you cannot trust them that much, how will they be when they are adults?  By the way... AMD is actually one of the most popular processors on the market and is sold for people who require it and have knowledge about computers.  Intel, also is good but, AMD is more flexible, and where the hell did you get all this third-world bullshit?  Second, the program Flash is actually an enhanced way of webdesign, if your son knows this, he can place it on his resume and be a pro-webdesigner.  Flash is just like Adobe except for the web and animation.  Quake has NOTHING to do with hacking, it depends on the people who play the game Gibbons, it is actually an online game for socialization and competition.  Last but not least LINUX (not lunix) is an operating system that MOST people use for servers.  If we didnt have Linux... Websites would go slower than they should.  Linux is an operating system meant for only hosting webspace, etc (and other such shit) that you obviously are not aware of.  Please tell me where you got this information becauce 99.999999999999999999999999999999% of it is total bullshit.  To define hacker: A person able to intrude on another parties system illigally.  MOST hackers can make their own programs and generate their own viruses.  So dont think that AMD is for hackers... its just a friggin processor allowing your system to run LOL.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Asking for a new video card and new hardware is not like asking for a gun. 60% of all Americans play video games, some like cutting edge technology, and a new video card and hard-drive is still cheaper than an XBox (Microsofts attempt to strangle the 6 billion dollar industry).

AOL does put alot of restriction on its users.  Especially when is comes to email and relaying.  And you can most definitly control another computer using command calls.  Lets not forget about the code red virus.  When i looked through my webservers log files i could see infected machines.  When that is known a cmd.exe is place in several key places on the infected server.  Once that is known a hacker has total cmd control of your computer.
<BR>

<BR>
From what you have said above i wouldnt be to worried about your son being a hacker.  he sounds more like a computer geek.  this is not a bad thing.  If he becomes proficient then later in life he will make a lot of money.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
If this still bothers you and you want to be a computer nazi just place some restrictions on the computer.  Not sure what you are running but win 2000 can put a halt to several behaviors above and then you could netnanny to monitor him on the internet.  of course there is always the key logger....

I myself have 3 kids all of which use all of the above programs and have all read those books! as soon as i read this article i called the cops and had them arrested! they had accumulated a vast quantity of .mp3 hacks and just a month ago we changed from AOL to a company providing Cable.. as they said that the webpages were loading slowly... but now i see it all clearly.. i was deceaved by my own kids! this is outragous! i went through their web history and found noumarous sites afiliated with hacking EG: "http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/" i asume this is where they got it from... i also did a little reserch! and found out that Dos runs with a command called "command.com" i advise that if you do now want your clildren running this Dos hack to click "Start" -=&gt; "find" -=&gt; "files or folders" and enter "command.com" and then search for them.. deleting any on these files that you can find! a commen place for it to b hiding is c:\ and also c:\windows
<BR>

i urge you to do this with most heist! to make the world a much Hacker free place to be!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
flash isnt hacking software, it let's you view flash. read the content in the goddamn site.
<BR>

<BR>
MS DOS is only used on your computer, you cant get access to another person's computer with just MS DOS, MS DOS is used for commands so you can do stuff with your computer, live view files and stuff, a mere MS DOS command doesnt give you access to anything except the things on your computer only.
<BR>

<BR>
mp3's are music files, they have no connection to hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
the c drive is where you keep regular files, if your kids we're hackers they would store their files in another drive, deleting any anyonymous file that you asume as a hacker program or shit would probably fuck up your computer.
<BR>

<BR>
get it from the people who know computers best, this is obviously fake and should not be beleived.

I hate to say it, but most intelligent people are intolerant of stupid people because they don't want to have to constantly stop and explain everything.

That aside, I don't think that 50 years of british humour would help at all. They'd simply sit there and not understand anything.

Americans simply miss the concept of subtlety.
Both countries have slapstick comedy, but americans do it with no style or elan whatsoever, it's just in your face

If you want to compare the two, try watching the french taunting in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', then watch 'Southpark Episode 405 - Pip'. The girl uses the same style of abuse as the French, however it is very direct and could be directed at him specifically (for him to take offence), whereas the Monty Python is too silly for anyone to do anything but laugh.

They had decided to be creative and not include canned laughter. The result was that when it was showed to an American audience, they didn't understand that it was humour, they thought it was a "real" soap opera. When it was showed in some European countries, however, the audience had no trouble identifying it as humour.

<BR>

<BR>
Let me ask you a couple of questions.  First, what temperature does coffee boil at?  Well, water boils at 212 degrees F., 100 deg. C.  Considering that coffee is mostly water, it will be pretty close to that.
<BR>
Second, what temperature does clothing and skin, as you put it "melt" at?  A hell of a lot higher than 212 degrees.
<BR>
Now, as anybody who's taken basic high-school physics knows: a liquid, when it reaches it's boiling point, doesn't actually increase in temperature until it's entire mass has changed state from liquid to gas...therefore there is no possible way in the universe that the coffee that she spilled on her lap was over 212 degrees.  Considering that she got it, put it in her lap, and drove some distance, I'd say, even if it was boiling when they poured it in the cup, it couldn't have been over 200 degrees when she spilled it.  True, 200 degree liquid in your lap could give you a pretty nasty burn, but it would hardly "melt through her skin almost down to the bone."

<BR>
Surely, anyone with enough knowledge of science to know so much about boiling water also knows that a human cannot function without their brain actually being inside their head?  If he were using his brain as a paperweight, I doubt that he would be able to type (I suppose that you could put the paper inside your head, but that would result in problems of it's own...)
<BR>

I suggest that you do some research before posting again on this matter...

   As for you British: I'll Boston tea party your ass any day.  We left you because you were opressive bafoons.  You and your cherry red blazers and deafening drums.

   We saved your complacent asses in WWII...  Bad teeth, while making you socially unacceptable in the rest of the world, didn't scare the Germans away.  So shove it!

We'd been treating you like cattle for years, what was going on in Europe at that time? Was it the French putting ideas in your head? America was a backwater till a third of the way into the  20th century.

<BR>
Why has America started re-righting history?
<BR>

<BR>
Aeroplanes; no you did not have the 1st powered flight, U271; film with U-boat, Computers, Patriot; the film with Brit's eating babies, micro chips, Packet switching, ect

I mean we were all born from pitiful crazy fanatics so it's understandable that we are so stupid. American's dont know anything. None of us do, we never succeed at anything, and we just sit in our pathetic poverty groveling about money for a cheesburger. Sure 100% American. While British people are making intelligent comedy's that make American Comedy look derranged. They  raise fine perfect families in a fine perfect society where everyone profits and enjoy's their life. No one in America enjoys their life, nope no one. We are too stupid to figure out anything that could be even slightly amusing. Oops was that a slip of sarcasm?
<BR>

<BR>
I'll admit, there are plenty of stupid Americans. There are also stupid European's. There are very intelligent Americans, and very intelligent Europeans. The fact that whoever posted this insult to America can't recognize our culture and way of life, does not mean we are wrong, or stupid. If anything it proves British (At least this one) to have a lot of pride, but mabye they are still hurting from being booted out of America. Perhaps our comedys are more funny to us then Monty Pithon? I dont think Monty Pithon is as funny as South Park, and does that make me a cruel and distorted human being? I don't think so. Now I'm 18 years old and I know this much, all Americans can't be as stupid as you say. 
<BR>

<BR>
And have you not heard the phrase 'Ignorance is Bliss?"
<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps it's true here. Mabye some American's don't know much, but it's possible to love your life and love those around you, and also be dumb. I'm sure it's more likely to find a very smart and wise person to have a more miserable life then others because everything they see they look down on. There are many ways to look at the world. I understand and respect opinions that have facts to back them up, but this one is far false. I don't know anything about the author, but I know that you my friend can not make statements like that and have them be truthful.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

A movie isn't a comedy unless it stars some well-known comedian and includes lots of scenes of men getting hit in the testicles.  Above all, don't ever try to post a "humorous" article on the internet unless you're using about a hundred of those little smiley faces as punctuation, or people won't know you're joking.  Then they'll rise up in righteous indignation, and fill up the bandwidth with witty rejoinders such as "ur a idiot dude".<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Everyone is different. I mean, example, not all canadians are nice and not all Americans are ignorent. (Althought from what iv seen it seems to be the majority). Dumbasses are everywhere.

<BR>
Do maths the American way - make up an answer, and because your classmates are all also american, they wont notice!!!

MS DOS is 95% more so used to gain access to a another users machine maybe YOU should get a clue  before dicsussing matters that you know nothing about.

<BR>
NET USE X: \\ipnumber 
<BR>
think about that
<BR>

<BR>
Also flash could be regarded as hacking too or more so 'be malicious' as to place a piece of code called a 'virus' into swf files. it has been done.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes agreed mp3 is a type of compression 
<BR>
MPEG 3 as apposed to MPEG 1 its the way the files is compressed.
<BR>

<BR>
as for deleting files on your Hard Drive namely (C:\) or drive c as the user above suggests, agreed don't just go about deleting files of you home machine when you have no clue as to what they do.

Obviously ppl who think that this guy was being completely serious shouldn't be reading articles on a site for "Grown-ups" when they haven't Grown-up yet! I suggest that the ignorant americans here (not to say all americans are ignorant), with your comical one-liners and your applause signs need to do some developing in the humour department. I think the comment about downloading the last 50 years of british comedy programmes was mainly a jealous stab at your high speed internet access. As it is more widely available over in the states, the poster may have some distaste due to ignorance on your part, however the main point is true, you should watch british comedy programmes/films, and not just your hollywood crap.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Even worse, I also use AMD in a lotof the computers i upgrade and build for many of my customers (looks like i am a hacker as well). I think the saddest thing here is that this person would only PUSH their son towards the "darker" side of hacking due to the mistrust and faulse belief that their children are actually breaking the law as a "hacker". I think daddy might need to go and get a few more computer classes before telling other parents how to bring up their children.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Linux has a lot of advantages for the technologicaly informed, is absoulotly free, is much more stable, and does not crash or freeze like windows, and is more difficult to use.

If you truly fired employees because they had Linux installed on their computers, you are both better off, you, because you have peace of mind, and them, because they will be much happier with an employer with more techno-savy.

I am 49 years old, have 4 kids at home, and numorous computer systems, and parts of systems. In my mind, hacking is the same as walking on the grass instead of the sidewalk. Hacking is not illegal, stealing is.
<BR>

<BR>
It is legal for you to fly over my home, and take picture while you do it. If you go sell those pictures, you owe me money. That was illegal. There is no law against you taking the picture. 
<BR>

<BR>
On 9/13, I observed a young, black, attorney, taking a picture of the security personal at BWI airport. That was certainly an innocent act before 9/11. But those security guards were very upset that someone was photographing them. Was it illegal? No. Did it demonstrate poor judgement? Yes.
<BR>

<BR>
In my mind, the danger on the internet is:
<BR>
#1 Pornography
<BR>
#2 Chat rooms

<BR>
Happy hacking!

Needless to say that our IT department, as well as being slightly smaller, has recieved the sternest warnings about this type of software being used in the company. 
<BR>
Perhaps an ethically sound organisation, such as Microsoft could be persuaded to supply monitoring software which would flag illegal installations such as this and remove hackers files such as the 'command.com' mentioned in the article? It would help me sleep much easier at night knowing my company was in their safe, reliable hands.

by<br><i>
+++The Mentor+++<br></i>
Written January 8, 1986
<BR><BR>
Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
<BR><BR>
Damn kids. They're all alike.
<BR><BR>
But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
<BR><BR>
I am a hacker, enter my world...
<BR><BR>
Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
<BR><BR>
Damn underachiever. They're all alike.
<BR><BR>
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."
<BR><BR>
Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.
<BR><BR>
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
<BR><BR>
Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.
<BR><BR>
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
<BR><BR>
Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...
<BR><BR>
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. 
<BR><BR>
This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
<BR><BR>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.
<BR><BR>
I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

I can't do much yet, but I am practicing.
<BR>
But from what little I know, I hope that this person is joking. If that is the case, I demand an apology. He says Quake teaches us to shoot firearms. Yup, I'm a pretty good aim. O, you mean an actual gun? Geez, sorry, I don't know. Violent video games make me have a thirst to kill people.
<BR>
Despite the fact that I hate to see others harmed and animals slaughtered, right?

My local hard disk has had all it can take!  Why, if it wasn't for my great firewall I don't think I'd even have a keyboard anymore.  These dern kids need to realize the effects that their actions have on society!  If my parents found out that I was downloading someone else's motherboard, they'd have my head!

Every computer that is running windows has a command.com. And AOL. Well AOL just plain stinks, in my opinion. So they switched to cable. That just means that they can go faster and doesn't mean that they can hack better. Don't be jumping to conclusions because of some things that you don't know what your talking about...

Obviously it was ove rmost people's heads.

He was using sarcasm to make his joke.  Sarcasm!

Everyone is calling him an idot because he said he arrested his kids, found them using Flash etc.
<BR>

<BR>
He was making a joke because anyone believing this article would not have enough computer smarts to know what command.com did, and would therefore delete it.  At least, that was what he was tyriung to get across, whichw as what made it funny.

First pull your head out of your ass, then get some computer smarts behind you,  and do a lil research.  Have you ever though to go to some of these sites your kids is going to...and see if there is any coralation with hacking involved in them.  Good lord woman, gag me with a toothpick.

AMD is a professional chip maker so i dont know how you got 'knock off', once again learn the facts buddy, been there done that. As for the hacking material..PERL is cgi..cgi is used to run simple programs such as a guestbook to counters on many professional sites..about DOSsing..i dont think you have to worry about your son DOSsing anyone with AOL since 56k couldnt break down no server in this world lol..about the social behaviour thing you say: "He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." "..BUDDY MAYBE IN THE 1920'S YOU DIDNT HAVE A THING CALLED PUBERTY OR YOU FORGOT ABOUT IT. wait let me finish laughing at the linux,bsd remark. linux is used just about every company running web hosts and servers. real hackers huh..about the clothes..LMAO are you saying your son is a happy hardcore rocker raver if he is a hacker? about academics..i've done my share of hacking in my time and my grades have not slipped but gone up or have stayed the same throughout! (a's and b's). i'll give you what you said about the damage to eyes and other stuff..well hope you open your stupid ignorant views

<BR>

<BR>
You're the best example of American ignorance. Seriously, perhaps you should attend a crash course in computing before trying to share your "knowdelge" with the world. Seriously, how much did AOL, M$ and Intel pay you for that article?
<BR>

<BR>
1. I agree, AOL is simple to use and good for families with children. Sucks otherwise (no dial-up, a ressource hog client etc., you might wanna search for these terms on the net, as I doubt you are aware of their meaning).
<BR>

<BR>
2. AMD is a California-based computer chip company with a 30-year history (quite "un-American", eh?). Their recent chips (Athlon series) outperform Intel's chips, while available at lower prices. AMD is #1 choice nowadays (unless you buy overpriced stuff like Dell etc.) And yes, you can go to you local store and boy one =)
<BR>

<BR>
3. Shockwave Flash is for intenet animation, not hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Quake is a computer game series, and again, has nothing to do with hacking. It's a violent shooter, not suitable for your children, but it's a computer game. Computer gaming and hacking are different things. (BTW, only games require mad hardware ressources, e.g. fast video cards).
<BR>

<BR>
I suggest you quit writing articles which concern computing, at least until you have gained SOME knowledge of the topic! Not only have you embarrassed yourself, but your entire family.
<BR>

<BR>
Regard,
<BR>

AOL is a breeding ground for warez pups and wana be hackers, and any real hacker would connect to IRC through aol wich is the bigest hacker breeding ground. "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash" that was a laugh riot, It put me on the floor. Read up on these programs none of wich are used by "hackers". any ways the only real way to find out whats installed on your comp is checking your registry most real "hacker" progrmas are not uninstallable by control panel. Hacking requires very little computing power, many hackers opt for less powerfull systems infact. AMD stands for American Micro Devices u dipsh1t it is traded on NYSE and is found in many affordable and high speed pcs.  "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly the only reason you would stop your child from reading this is if u fear he might try using it to create a shoping cart for a website or do any other cgi work. DOSing takes 8hours my a$$. No real hacker would DOS from his home computer any ways. but he is right about quake it is the biggest hacking tool ever. Anyways i am not going to waste anymore of my time posting. I just hope no one takes this seriously. and goes on the internet themselves to get real information.

I now make a quarter-mil a year perfectly legally, I'm a veteran volunteer firefighter and have a lot of laughs.  I've also been on and around the internet since before it was ever even called that, made lifelong friendships on the net, and helped a lot of kids.
<BR>
Good parents have nothing to fear; only an inherently bad parent would feel (their control, maybe?) threatened by Linux, a computer, a video game, a movie, a skateboard, or any of the other influences on a child in our world.  Treat kids as the intelligent proto-adults that they are and don't smother them with paternal righteousness.  It won't kill you.  Or them.  It will only threaten your own head trip about making a perfect, but lifeless, obedient sculpture of a "good kid."
<BR>
You can raise them to be a terrified Windows-drone, taking what they're spoon-fed, fearful of Naughty Things and Those Who Are Not Like You, and they'll be victims of people all their lives.  Including you.

I have monitored him for about three days now and I found out that he has been going to site such as newgrounds.com, a site with movies that I believe have secret messages about hacking in them, alienaa.com, which has many message boards with people talking about stuff like bytes and hacks and credits (a way of ranking in the world of hacking), and pokemon.com, which I don't need to touch on. He has spent about 45 minutes to an hour each day going to sites like this. 
<BR>
  I have also looked through the programs on my computer. I have found things such as mIRC, perl, Comet, Gator, MSN Messenger, and graal. I looked around these. mIRC is a meeting of hackers. They talk in code using words like 1337, h4X0r, and lol.

  I fear for my son's life, so I have discontinued his computer use and grounded him. I feel that all parents should take the same measures if they discover any of these in their child's behavior.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I play computer games all the time and i spend atleast 2 hours a day on here but im not a hacker. Apparently you think you are some almighty genius who knows everything because "you spent a few days researching hackers." First of all Quake is a game just like Half-Life or Diablo II. And in alot of online games, the more time you play the better you are. For example Diablo II. You get better by gaining experience which takes time to do. It takes months to get a really high lvl char on there if you dont play 8 hours a day. SO that point is shot down *WOO HOO*. Second of all LINUX not LUNIX is a os just like windows. And alot of people prefer to use it because a) they hate microsofts monopoly on everything, b) they learned computers back when linux was more popular therefore thats what they know best or c) its just easier than windows. I'm not even going into the rest of it but this has been the perfect example of people labeling us youth b/c we are different from what they were as a kid. All of you gamers and fellow digital friends out there *LMAO* and i know you are too. Peace

It genuinely worries me that so many people on the net today can't recognize a spoof/parody when they see it. The *proper* response to this post would to be attempt to one-up it in terms of creative idiocy. Instead...insipid, self-righteous declarations of superior intelligence. Is this what the net has come to? Sad. It's like the people who write in to Dave Barry to ask him if the Leaning Tower of Pisa was REALLY sold to France. (It wasn't, of course. It remains in Germany, where it has always been since Leonardo da Vinci (Ancestor of Leonardo diCaprio) built it.)

<BR>
I read your informative article with great interest. Sadly, I am now certain that members of my own family must be engaged in this evil pursuit. Young Clifford displayed almost the exact symptoms you describe (although his fondness for the so-called "Quake" reality has given way to the more morally uplifting "Counter-Strike", in which he casts his virtual self as a law-enforcement officer). Nonetheless, I have notified the juvenile correction authorities, who quickly despatched a team of case-officers to detain and interrogate him. I write this message of thanks while waiting on a verdict about his incarceration. Yours truly, Herman P. Dickhead.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
You are a bad parent! You are far from being enlightened.  I will start by stating if you are going to automatically asume what a "hacker" is you had better get your facts straight first.
<BR>
1) what is a hacker?  
<BR>
a hacker in its true and ORIGINAL sense is an enthusiast, an artist, a tinkerer, a problem solver, an expert.
<BR>

<BR>
2)ISP, Hardware, software, books
<BR>
Sir, I would advise reading some of those books, or actually doing your homework before knocking legitimate companies such as ID, Macromedia, and AMD.
<BR>

<BR>
3)problems with your sons behavior?
<BR>

<BR>
GO FIGURE! you obviously have no idea what a raising children is about.  You have no clue what technology is about, you have no clue what anything is about.  and just cause your son doesnt see the world for what you do, and might have an IQ higher than yours, you automatically condem him for it.  maybe he doesnt want to live his life in the stone age like you do.
<BR>

<BR>
4)Alternitive operating systems
<BR>

<BR>
sir, I like you put up the web sites with those names, obviously you choose not to accually READ those sites, you just made shit up.  stateing it as fact when in reality you couldnt be more wrong.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Sir, I hope that you accually grow a brain and gain some knowledge about what you OBVIOUSLY showed you no nothing about.
<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Oh man, where to begin? this is insane, there are so many things wrong with this article hmmm, lets start with 
<BR>
#1. there is nothing wrong with getting a *home based* ISP. In fact if you want broadband, kiss AOhelL goodbye alltogether; and anyway, the adult content filters can be SHUT OFF. I mean, really, if this kid is a hacker, you'd think he could find the adult content tab in AOL.
<BR>

<BR>
2.Bonzai buddy is a childs Instant Messanging program, not a hacker program, all it does is give your name away to every site on the internet so you get 5 times the spam mail. Flash is a neccisary addition to internet explorer to be able to view many sites.
<BR>

<BR>
3.A video card NEVER has anything to do with hacking, all it does is let you see the screen, if you can run windows, you can hack. Bigger Harddrive just means more space to put YOUR stuff on, also has no effect on hacking abilities. Memory, HA, without enough, you cant run ANY programs.
<BR>
Processors, wow. AMD IS sold in many very reliable COPORATE OUTLETS, and guess what?
<BR>
Intel chips are made in malaysia.
<BR>

<BR>
4.Ok, Programming in Perl is a REFERENCE manual, made of college courses, if this were illegal, they wouldnt sell this in bookstores out front with martha stewart. Neuromacer is a top 10 bestseller, this is as ludacris as hitler burning books that didnt reflect his *perfect nation* and it doesnt matter how many booksellers you petition, the LIBRARY will have most, if not all of these books in record.
<BR>

<BR>
5.Half an hour? can YOU honestly say you only spend half an hour? and most hacking is a lot faster then this *article* leads you to believe. Yes, DOS attacks are long drawn out affairs, but most attacks are quick and steathy. The idea is to get in and out before the whole you made is noticed. 10 minutes is AMPLE time to wreak havoc in a system, while you watch one sitcom, your little hacker could destroy 3 or more systems.
<BR>

<BR>
6.Quake is a GAME. any program with internet access can be used properly or improperly. while you surf the net, you can use chatrooms built right into the sites to have meetings and discussions, the very reason they were created. You can use IM programs such as MSN ICQ Yahoo or AIM, to transfer files and ideas freely without trace, it all comes down to who you WANT to talk to, if you want it bad enough, you can find it.
<BR>

<BR>
7.Hi, its called adolecence. moving on...
<BR>

<BR>
8.Lunix? er, perhaps if the author researched his paper information before posting it , he could get some information correct. first of all, its LINUX. Secondly all *nix operating systems are more reliable and stable for business and corparate situations, such as Datafarms or Programming. Unless you leave your CreditCard ##s in a file, it doesnt matter how thuroghly a hacker searches your harddrive, if they arent saved on it, (S)he wont find it. stealing your music from your stereo: your stereo would have to be attached to your computer, turned on, and be able to recieve remote commands, and anyway, hackers dont concern themselves with stealing MP3s from your stereo. There are search engines and programs to do that from people who are completely willing to share them. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT STEALING YOUR COPY, because thats all it is, everyone has COPIES of the same thing. By the way, do you have the CD for every single MP3 you have? no? then guess what, youre stealing too. Linux is DANGEROUS? hmm, everything can be dangerous if MISused. As for removing the Harddrive, that s a total lie, any software can be deleted of a harddrive, or you can format the harddrive. it DOES NOT need to be pyshically destroyed. I know from person expirience that BOTH linux and windows can do things to make your computer crash, but windows is far more likely to have this happen.
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has said hacker changed their apearance? Well, once again misconceptions abound in this part of the *article*(and i use the term lightly, this is more fiction then fact) there is nothing wrong with a person wanting to radically change the way they look to reflect their beliefs. Have you ever cut your long hair, just so you could have a shorter style? Have you ever dyed your hair? Glo-sticks, and pacifiers? the writer seems to have his social evils mixed up, those 2 items are far more likely to be the hallmark of a raver then a hacker. Oh, and if youre wondering, the pacifiers are for those ravers who take E (Ecxtasy, XTC), when you take that durg, many people have a tendancy to grind their teeth, hence the soft pacifiers. If the hacker is old enough to be intellectually advanced enough to understand hacking, a strict curfew will solve nothing, and anyway how will keeping him(her) IN THE HOUSE with the computer, stop him from hacking, better to let him(her) leave the house and accosiate with people outside in the *real world* then to force him(her) to stay in and do nothing(and like a teenager cant go out the window). You cannot baby your child forever, eventually they will have to start forming their own ideas, that doesnt mean you shouldnt help, that just means ASSIST, dont FORCE your ideas on them.
<BR>

<BR>
10. Hmm, well you cant blame the guy for trying. If something is wrong with the kid, it must be hacking. Children had trouble in schools long before the computer was even a common household apliance, this is nothing new, and will continue. The fact of the matter is, most hackers are relatively bright individuals, and as such, do quite well in school, in fact the majority of hackers remain unknown simply because of the fact that they are smart enough NOT TO GET CAUGHT. The part about eye/brain damage is unbelieveable, the author of this article was sitting in front of a computer monitor to compose it, i wonder, did he worry about his health because of it? As for the link from the words *computer radiation* that talks about the likelyhood of this being the cause, it does not even fully support the authors claims, this is just as bad as when people made claims that CELLPHONES CAUSE BRAIN CANCER, there have been several studies that have shown otherwise. Do you worry about brain cancer when you take that call in the car on the way to work in the morning? Well then we have the next great scapegoat for you, computer monitors. *...reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight...* Well yes, you cant argue that, although the author makes it sound like, being out of shape is an illness that hackers alone can contract. Maybe if you didnt enforce such a strict curfew on little billy he wouldnt weigh so much, or be so sedentary.
<BR>

<BR>
In closing I encourage everyone to read both side of the argument before going on a witch hunt. For the sake of all of us, lets try and keep a reasonable head on our shoulders, and realize when we see something that is purely inflammitory and should never have been written.

and hacking is not an act! its a way of thinking!
<BR>

<BR>
perhaps you should spend more time with your children while they are on the internet. instead of banning quake, you should buy another pc, and play along with him..  the technology and hackers will allways be there, its up to you to teach them how to deal with such people, and to set an example. not to shelter them for life, until someone breaks through your barrier, and steals them away from you, because its something new.. my god man, wake up, and smell the coffee!
<BR>

<BR>
as for terrists, they have no place in the hackers world, and they couldn't even begin to understand true hackers. little alone keep up with the advancements of our technology..

#1) Flash is hacker software? haha

<BR>
#2) Quake is a game, and only a game!

#3) Its LINUX and his name is Linus Torvalds, its not a hacking OS.. its a windows alternative which is actually safer than windows and more stable.

It is the nicest joke that Linux is a soviet product, if it weren't meant seriously. The Perl manual is not any hacker book, because perl is one of the most popular scripting languages, probably used in this webserver, too. And Linux? You use lot of web pages on servers running linux. Please, stop to use them if you think that it is the hkr software.

Many things in this article are just misleadings, but there are things which are really direct advertisement. <b>You should ask Microsoft, Adobe and Intel to pay for this article</b>.

But nevertheless I have laughed a lot when i read that couple of nonsenses. I have three boys and if THAT means to be a hackr, then I want them to be. :O)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

To even attempt to respond to such a tirade of pure ignorance would take hours. You aren't simply "overcautious" or "a bit off", you have absolutely no damn idea what you are talking about in the slightest. It truly saddens and disgusts me to be reminded that such ignorant people as you are active members of the gene pool.

Please, next time, never write about something you know nothing at all about. All you have done is made anyone who is dumb enough to believe your bilesome rant that much dumber.

<BR>

<BR>
like yourselves, I too am a concerned parent who prides themselves on rearing my children exactly how you are supposed to. And thank the Lord our saviour I found this page before my children did! I do not know how to thank you for this insight into the world of computers and these deviant unamerican hackers who infest the rest of the world. I had no idea about any of this information, but thanks to your site I now know what I should and should not be doing when it comes to monitoring the lives and internet activities of my children. Lunix, Day-glo, MP3's, AMD, Quake, and coloured hair; thanks to you I now know what to look out for when making sure my children grow up exactly  how they should.
<BR>

<BR>
In short, thank you for telling me what I need to know.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Linux has a lot of advantages for the technologicaly informed, is absoulotly free, is much more stable, and does not crash or freeze like windows, and is more difficult to use.
<BR>

<BR>
If you truly fired employees because they had Linux installed on their computers, you are both better off, you, because you have peace of mind, and them, because they will be much happier with an employer with more techno-savy.

I am 49 years old, have 4 kids at home, and numorous computer systems, and parts of systems. In my mind, hacking is the same as walking on the grass instead of the sidewalk. Hacking is not illegal, stealing is.
<BR>

<BR>
It is legal for you to fly over my home, and take picture while you do it. If you go sell those pictures, you owe me money. That was illegal. There is no law against you taking the picture. 
<BR>

<BR>
On 9/13, I observed a young, black, attorney, taking a picture of the security personal at BWI airport. That was certainly an innocent act before 9/11. But those security guards were very upset that someone was photographing them. Was it illegal? No. Did it demonstrate poor judgement? Yes.
<BR>

<BR>
In my mind, the danger on the internet is:
<BR>
#1 Pornography
<BR>
#2 Chat rooms
<BR>

<BR>
Happy hacking!

Yeah, and maybe if your editors actually did something once in a while your site would host concise, well written and most importantly well sourced articles.
Your masthead claims you are the most controversial and congested web site. You got what you wanted, the article has caused controversy and congested the site with short posts from the people who are annoyed because you have published articles which contain unfounded claims, misinformation and slander (maybe AMD would like to talk to the writer of the article, there is a very fine line between your right to free speech and slander).
<BR><BR>
You wanted to be controversial, so you published an inane article with little factual basis. At least the incorrectly spelt posts contain truth.
<BR><BR>
So yeah IMHO opinion you posted an article full of bullshit, again.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

You are stero-typing hackers. I have come across a few hackers on the Internet and in Real Life. "They Dye their hair".. No.. they don't. Punk teenagess do that.
<BR>

<BR>
It's just like me saying, Anyone who uses a Skateboard takes drugs.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes I understand your point, It can interfere with life.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is not a place where hackers meet. Quake is a 3D Game Programmed by respectible programming companies such as EIDOS. Surely a minority of users may use it to contact and talk about hacking. As people use the telephone to talk about illegal things. Once again, "Anyone who uses phones is doing something illegal". It's all very sterotypical.
<BR>

<BR>
You really need to think about what your posting before you post it. "If you son spends more than 30 minutes on the PC a day, they maybe a hacker"?
<BR>
What if your son is very interested in PC Software and the Programming side of applications? They have to come from somewhere.
<BR>

<BR>
You obviously have no idea what DoS means either. But I'm not going into it.
<BR>

<BR>
Dear lord.. reading on you have NO idea what your talking about. "Linux" is an extremely legitimate peice of software. It is a full Operating System It's only dangerous if used for hacking. It's extremely useful for Creating Graphics.
<BR>

<BR>
To Remove it, you simply need to format the harddrive. Really.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I tottaly disagree with everything you post. It's the most rediculous post I've seen to date.

I first thought this was a joke, but by the amount of comments posted, this must be true. 
<BR>
Like i said, im completely appaled here. The person who wrote this, has ABSOLUTELY NO (i cant make letters bigger) ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE whatsoever of anything computer-wise. My guess is, that person must still use a typewriter at work. Please, do the world a favour. Die. Or shut up, but please, do one of the options. I strongly urge anyone unfortunate enough to ignore completely this article, as it has absolutely no real information in it. Not a single line is true. And please refrain from comenting. Maybe that way, the person writing this .... er .... this "something" will take a minute to think....and read some books for some REAL knowledge. Or better, surf the Internet for some REAL knowledge.

(I wont tell you where to find the info) but it is out there and easy to find ! True hackers use much less obvious ways to gain access to a system. It is true that there are lots of easy-to-download tools out there that can be used to access a system. You should first of all rush out and buy programs like "Norton Internet Security (latest version)", and "Norton Firewall (latest version)" With these easy to use tools, you should be more safe than you ever was before ! Im not saying that you will be completely hackerproof, NO SYSTEM IS !! There are ways to bypass firewalls also, and when that is done it is easy to find the memoryaddress where the protection software is loaded and then disable it, leaving the system defenceless !! Now youre probably thinking about why you should rush out and spend hundreds of dollars on new software that can be compromised !? To that I must say that there are TWO categories of hackers.. Script Kiddies & Hackers - Script Kiddies are the WannaBeHackers that in most cases do not have the skills to write hacking programs them selves, but they use whatever tools available on the net. They can be stopped in most cases with the software mentioned here. Real hackers are mostly interested in hacking into big companies and government facilities. They are usually NOT interested in single individuals using a computer at home !! To wrap this up I must say to everyone out there... It is VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO STORE CREDITCARD INFORMATION ON YOUR COMPUTER (If youre connected to the internet through DSL, Cable or other Always-On connection !!)

With all those stupid statements one can only assume this is a joke but since I know nothing about this site or its articles I have to take all with a grain of salt.  Anyway this was pretty much the stupidest article I have ever had the displeasure of reading  I hope you all see that the athlon XP is much superior to the P4 since it destroyed the P4 in ALL areas of processing during the benchmark tests.  You can view these at http://athlonxp.amd.com click on the benchmark tab.  It also shows the specs on both computers that were used in the benchmark tests and you will see that they were as evenly matched as they could be with the drastic difference in hardware.  Also keep in mind that the athlon xp 1900+ doesn't actually operate at 1.9GHZ you can read all about it on that site and maybe you'll come to the realisation that it is now intel's time to fall to its knees and bow before the great AMD.  <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
11. Is ur father a spy?
<BR>

<BR>
If u've noticed some monitors in the walls in ur room, u bet ur father have installed'em. Write with big font in Word or something "I'm a hacker". Just so u don't get ur father disapointed in his search for ur hacker progs etc.
