eg  linux.... is good software cos you learn to program with it, which is good if you'd like to earn yer mony in programming later...
<BR>
but yeah, hacking is programming too...
<BR>
not nessesatyly bad thing, as many software companies invite hackers to try and hack their new software...

etc etc...

<BR>
Hacker - 1. One who is proficient at using or programming a computer; a computer buff. 2. One who uses programming skills to gain illegal access to a computer network or file
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
First, I'd like to examine what a hacker is using the dictionary definition. According to the dictionary, anybody proficient in using a computer is a "hacker". Since you were able to join this forum and post your propiganda, its safe to assume your a hacker, because your proficient at using a computer. That is the first dictionary definition, which I do NOT agree with. That would mean that at least 40% of the people who use the internet are "hackers".
<BR>

<BR>
The second definition is even less accurate. Someone who uses illegal means to access other computers. But, since the laws are different in every country, those who fit the second definition in some countries do not fit in others.
<BR>

<BR>
So, from both of those, we have to assume that "hacker" is a very general term, and as a general term, we must assume that ANYBODY can be a hacker, depending on where they live and what they do for a living.
<BR>

<BR>
For example, the american government has organisations whos sole purpose is to "hack" systems for intelligence and criminal investigation. BUT, these organisations are santioned by the government, and therefore not illegal.
<BR>

<BR>
So lets examine why people fear "hackers". First of all, we assume "hackers" will access our system, and delete all our important files (work, system files, etc). The reason we fear this is because every once in a while we hear a story about some malisious 13 year old who breaks into a system to cause damage. But tell me? How many times has this happened to you?
<BR>

<BR>
Lets go back in time a few hundred years. There was another group of people who were feared to break into homes and disrupt life. We called them "witches". They were burned at the stake because people were scared that something bad was going to happen to them. To assume someone was a witch was to look at that persons actions and then make an uneducated, general assumption. That everybody who didn't act a certain was was concidered a "witch" or "evil".
<BR>

<BR>
As I read this parents conclusion as to how he "knows" his son is a hacker, and then to generally assume that everybody who follows a similer behaviour is also concidered a "hacker", I started getting upset. You see, I have exibited ALL the signs of a "hacker". 
<BR>

<BR>
Let me go though his "signs of a hacker" and use myself as an example. But before we do, I'd like to point out I have never attacked a system or accessed another system for malisious or illegal purposes.
<BR>

<BR>
1)First of all, AOL sucks. In my opinion, anybody who uses it is already cutting themselves off from valuable sources of information and basically saying "I want this mega corperation to decide what I am allowed to view and what I'm not, and therefore I give up my right of freedom of speech". Not to mention the speed is more than enough reason to use a highspeed ISP.
<BR>

<BR>
2)I have had flash on my computer for a long time. If I didn't have it, there would be many interesting sites that I couldn't view. Also, at one time or another I have had both "Bonzo Buddy" and "Comet Cursor" installed on my computer. I believe Bonzo Buddy is installed when "Real Player" or some other legitimate program is installed on your system. As for "Comet curser", when you view some webpages, it will ask you if you want to install this program to better view the site. Mostly, I've seen this on personal homepages, and extremely rarely on "hacking" sites.
<BR>

<BR>
3)My system has a 1 gightz AMD processer, a brand new video card and SHITLOADS of ram. The reason for this is i like USING my computer, and don't want to be limited to a 486 SX, 16 meg of ram and 16 colors on my monitor. 
<BR>

<BR>
4)I have a subscription to "Guide to ethical hacking" as well as several others. I use these for INFORMATION because, as most open minded individuals are, I am not opposed to learning new things to improve my mind (again, freedom of speech). Just because I know how to program a virus does NOT mean I will use it, but it does give me a solid means to defend myself against others with less morals. If, as this gentleman claims, he installed good values, he should trust his children enough to use their judgements in their actions.
<BR>

<BR>
5)I spend a LOT of time in front of a computer. It is a constint learning machine. I learn 3 times as much from one day in front of a computer than I would from one day in class. Even when I play video games, it allows me to open my mind to new possibilities and to use my rational mind to solve problems (which is what seperates humans from most other animals on this rock). Limiting computer time is basically limiting the use of the mind. Would you rather your son spend that time in front of a television getting brainwashed into conformity by being saturated by ads and getting a (equally) destorted sence of reality from the morals of "Sienfield" or "Friends"?
<BR>

<BR>
6)I've played Quake. GREAT game. But thats all Quake is, a game. Saying that "Hackers" go into it to discuss "hacking" just shows you've never played the game. Why Quake? Why not some chatrooms or ICQ? As for firearms, why would you even HAVE firearms if you don't trust your children not to use them?
<BR>

<BR>
7)I remember being argumentative and surly in my social behaviour. As I remember, it was when I was 13-18 years of age. It seems to me he has reason, if you jump to conclusions every time he exibits fairly normal behaviours that you don't automatically understand.
<BR>

<BR>
8)I have Linux installed on my computer, as well as winXP and win98. Their OPERATING SYSTEMS! Not some magic hacking tools. I won't bother going into details about these misconceptions, because they are so uninformed and unjustified that it left me at a loss for words.
<BR>

<BR>
9)13 to 18, long hair with the sides shaved (ya, I know), black cloths, flight jackets and Doc Martins. Do this things automatically make me a satanist? No, they didn't. The description you would fit most highschool kids today. From this, someone could concude that Highschools breed "hackers". But to conclude that you would have to exclude (a)peer preasure (b)fashion trends (c) television. My point? Coined best in the phrase "Don't judge a book by its cover", as true today as it has ever been.
<BR>

<BR>
10)I had a hard time in highschool, like a lot of people do. For me, it stemmed from trying to experience new things as quickly as possible. Some of those things may not have been good for me, but in a world where you take your life in your hands evertime you eat KFC, I think I did alright. Why not try helping him with his homework and let him follows his skills (which is obviously computers). Discuss what he wants to do with his life and what hes interested in. Maybe he wants to become a Programmer or a Systems Analist, maybe thats what he'll be good at. And maybe by limiting his information you are hampering that gift in him.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
To conclude, I have exibited EVERY one of these "Signs of a hacker". Again I'll state I am not doing anything I concider morally wrong, and since I recieved most of my morals from my parents, I know they raised me the best they could. 
<BR>

<BR>
I assume you haven't researched the field of "hacking" as well as you may have thought you did. If your son is a "hacker", instead of getting mad, ask him to show you what he can do, and make sure he knows you are open minded and not going to punish him because he knows Perl, C++ or how to access another system through a port (witch burning). If you instilled the morals on your children you claim you did, then these "10 Signs your son is a hacker" should be "10 signs your son is a normal teenager interested in learning everything he can about computers"<BR><BR></FONT></td>

To tell you the truth, I have shown this article to almost everyone that I know, at school, online, and even to my own parents. I have met laughter and ridicule (of the article, not me) in just about every single situation. Now, despite the fact that I would like to, I am not going to cuss out the author of this article. First off, I am an (almost) 15-year old boy who happens to be very proficcient at a computer. I do believe that a misunderstanding of what hacking is may be partially to blame, and that's why your explanation was good to have in such a post. If it wern't for mature people like yourself, the author of this aritcle would most likely ignore the cussing and blatant insults, and write all of those replying off as more hackers trying to defend their chosen occupation. I doubt this parent will be punishing his children for the normal things that they seem to be doing. That is, of course, assuming that he does read at least SOME of these comments. If he ignores them, then he is even more ignorant than I first assumed. Please, please lost and confused parent... read these comments. There are a few good, intelligent replies - if you weed those out from the cussing blather, perhaps you will actually learn something.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
1. "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash" are NOT hacking tools, they aren't even close. Comet Cursor is for changing your cursor appearance, Bonzi Buddy is a talking Gorilla, and Flash is for creating animations for the Internet.
<BR>
2. AMD is a much more powerful BETTER alternative to Intel's line of processors. They are not "cheap knock offs" as their chip architectures are entirely different from Pentiums.
<BR>
3. "Programming with Perl" is NOT a hacking manual, It is simply for teaching people to create "CGI Scripts" that create web pages such those you see on this site.
<BR>
4. I spend 8+ hours a day on my computer, and I'm not a hacker.
<BR>
5. "Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?", sounds like he's a normal teenager to me, and you're not helping with your attitude.
<BR>
6. It's spelt "Linux" not "Lunix", and you don't need a professional to reinstall Windows, even though it sounds like you need a professional to show you how to switch a computer on, and how exactly can Linux damage the surface of your hard drive?

7. "Has your son radically changed his appearance?" you say, again I'd put this down to you completely screwing up his life.
<BR>

<BR>
I honestly feel sorry for your son, I hope that your actions haven't mentally scarred him for life. Your son sounds like a capable computer technician and I wish him luck in what looks like could be a promising career ahead of him.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
1. AMD is a GREAT make of chip, they are not "knock offs", they are cheaper, and much better made, if anything, intel use sweatshops.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Linux - ha - a GREAT OS (Operating System), i) Secure, ii) Fast iii) Great for web servers. I bet that this web server uses a Unix based system!
<BR>

<BR>
3. Flash is NOT a hacking tool, nor Bonzi Buddy, or Comet Cursor. Flash is what is used to make animations on sites. Ha
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Also, hacking is NOT illegal, it is only illegal if you cause a certain level of damage, or there is a disclaimer to say that you should not view this information. This is the law in the UK at least.
<BR>

<BR>
Look, get your facts straight, alright, just learn that what you said basically is ALL a load of, well, no word to describe it.
<BR>

<BR>
AOL is an awful ISP as well, and there are plenty of better ones.
<BR>

<BR>
I think that hacking is good anyway, it teaches about the net, and what to do and not to do, and it also finds the holes, so that the software company can put them right.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, just read a good article about hacking, try www.astalavista.com - will show you about hacking sites.
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks for the fun and laughter (oh, sorry, it wasn;t a joke, really? HA!)

You are now the worst parent i've even known...i thought it would be difficult to top the previous one, but you did so with ease.  and i never thought it would be possible to hate someone just by one article they wrote, but again, you've proved me wrong and i hope you die before you damage any other human being's lives as you've most certainly done to your wife and children.
<BR>

<BR>
If i remember correctly (and i've looked up my information at trustworthy sites) compaq has a line of computers with the AMD processors.  Just the fact you bought a compaq shows you don't know shit about computers.  It just so happens that one of the few tests AMD processors regularly lose to Intel P4s is playing quake.  This was just to show your flawed logic without making my own statements containing my opinion.
<BR>

<BR>
I would imagine by how much you seem to know about computers that you must've spent about 8 hours typing that article making you a hacker and also not letting your son use the computer for perfectly legitimate purposes.
<BR>

<BR>
Why the hell did you have 6 kids if you plan on knowing where they all are at the same time.  You should pick up some more wifes to help you out.  You are ruining the wonderful experience of adolesence (although everything seems to suck while it's happening to yourself) and nothing good can come from what you're doing.  If you don't want your children to become crackheads save $100,000 and don't send them to college.  because you don't want them rebelling when they have the means to almost anything right down the hall.

On a lighter note, if you guys are so fucking religious how come your sex picture for those topics don't have the people ing the missionary position?

the mere statement that AMD produces inferior third world processors should raise some serious flags. in truth, i personally have a friend who works in AMD's headquarters...in TEXAS, the processors mar, or may mot be produced in other countries, but how many processors are actually produced in the U.S.? AMD also produces one of the finest products on the market todat, superior even to a comparable product from intel. and for a few years produced a processor intel couldn't come close to matching. so wanting an AMD Athalon is very understandable. i have an AMD k6-2 processor in my pc. and i bought it at a reputable computor dealer in San Diego.

I became very concerned, I monitered his computer use and noticed he began to use different words such as "COOL" and "KEWL", many others such as "1 4/\/\ |337 H4X0R". He started playing games such as "StarCraft" and "Diablo2". He started opening programs such as "Internet Explorer" and "Outlook Express" to check "E-mail" So please respect this man and his wisdom, he has helped me to overcome a particularly had time parenting my son, oh and one more thing...

<BR>
the mere statement that AMD produces inferior third world processors should raise some serious flags. in truth, i personally have a friend who works in AMD's headquarters...in TEXAS, the processors mar, or may mot be produced in other countries, but how many processors are actually produced in the U.S.? AMD also produces one of the finest products on the market todat, superior even to a comparable product from intel. and for a few years produced a processor intel couldn't come close to matching. so wanting an AMD Athalon is very understandable. i have an AMD k6-2 processor in my pc. and i bought it at a reputable computor dealer in San Diego.

NO!  do you people even know what a hacker is?  if you watch hollywood movies, they are made out to be "bad people"  this is not the case at all.  i, myself, spend hours at a time surfing the internet.  does this make me a hacker? NO.. not in the least.  i play quake, does this make me a hacker? 
<BR>
NO!
<BR>
most of my friends in college, and alot of kids that i know that live in other states, who are in high school, and college, they play it to.  they are not hackers, they are just normal kids who like to play computer games.  
<BR>
hackers are blamed for everything.
<BR>
if you follow what  T Reginald Gibbons posted. you parents are dumber then you think.  there is nothing wrong with kids asking for a bigger hard drive.  certainly nothing wrong with asking for a new video card.  all a video card will do is display graphics, and the nicer ones can handle more graphics, and make them appear alot cleaner.  how is this bad?
<BR>
as for drug use.. PLEASE!!!!
<BR>
you should see who the child is hanging out with.  that will tell you if they are doing drugs.  not staring at a computer screen.. staring at a computer screen is just going to make his eyes bad. 
<BR>
as for running linux, have you even tried it.. for that fact.. how many of you people even knew that there was another operating system that wasn't windows?
<BR>
linux is a much safer operating system then windows for many reasons.  it is more securer then windows, it will not have conflicts with things like windows does.
<BR>
the lack of computer knowledge is disgusting.  the people who see if their kids fit this.. then you can label every child who is a teenager, and older in this catagroy.. and then what would you do?  take away all of the computers for every child in the world?
<BR>
please, and as more and more people get broadband connections to the internet, kids will be playing online games more often, and staying on longer.  and once you have broadband connections, well there are things that can be done that would blow your mind away because there are NO safe guards on it.
<BR>
hacking is all about the free flow of information, and not keeping anything a secret, what is so bad about this?
<BR>
parents are just scared because you don't know ANYTHING of what the child is doing.  and your helplessness only makes it more enjoyable for the child.  
<BR>
if any parent really wants to do something, why not go and get educated about how to use computers, and the internet.  if this "MODEL" dad even took the time to have do things with his son, maybe he wouldn't have been so shocked.  why not use the internet together, so that he knows that you are taking an active interest in his life.
<BR>
as for AMD processors being the devil.  BULLSHIT!
<BR>
they are more powerful processors to intel.  you are worried about security runnin an Intel chip, then you didn't hear about what intel did with the new chips.  they made the new chips with a security device on them that allowed intel to monitor YOUR computer and to see what is going on with it
<BR>
PARENTS, i employ you to use common sense when it comes to computer.  if you seee your child doing something that you don't understand, by all means ask them to explain what they are doing.  this is not bad.  as for being a hacker, i bet no kids do anything bad.  
<BR>
you flip out because you don't know whats going on.  again, this gets back to my point about you parents being UNEDUCATED when it comes to computers.  
<BR>
i hope this bullshit arguement fades away whenever i have kids.  I KNOW I WILL BE EDUCATED in computers, and i also plan on working with them when i graduate.  
<BR>
EDUCATION IS KEY FOLKS.. i can't stress this enough.

If you actually read computer mags you should find out that AMD is  making "Knock off" chips. In actuallity there kicking intells ass in the CPU war.  Also a faster video card WILL make you're pc better not the other way around (If you uese microsuck's new OS (which is a pice of shit if you ask me))  
<BR>

<BR>
As for quake or tirbes 2 (for me) I am one 1227 gamer, and actually games are a good form of enteraiment.    
<BR>

<BR>
and well for the apperance hackers DON'T wear glow stick and pasafires.  Thoes belong to a groupe called "ravers".  Where they dance all day long (litterly going for 24 hours stright) 
<BR>

<BR>
Also for this so called hacker groupe named "Otaku".  It's actually an anime movie!

Last but defently NOT least is LINUX NOT FUCKING "Lunix"! and a nother thing BSD is a whole nother operating system ALLONE!  Programmers uese linux also INTELGENT KIDS like me uese the happy windows care free system oh and you do need a FUCKING PHONE to uese TELNET and Trovlous did not program that.  Microsuck did.

I don't believe being hostile towards the author is in any way constructive, either.  Therefore I will discuss and explain some of the more glaring errors found within said article, doing so with the hope that the author will recieve and read this message with an open mind.
<BR>

<BR>
1.  People seem to like America Online, especially for its child protection features (an aspect that is important to parents and is rightly so).  One drawback to America Online, however, is that because of its enormous popularity as an ISP, users commonly experience lower data transfer speeds than they would prefer (and lower than those advertised by America Online).  Basically, the more people logged onto the Internet using America Online, the slower each person's connection will be.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  As several readers have stated in various posted comments, the three programs listed here have absolutely nothing to do with computer hacking.  
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is a program that can change the appearance of the mouse cursor (this is not a permanent change).  The purpose of the program is entirely one of entertainment.  For example, a website that deals with cartoons may have a corresponding Comet Cursor that looks like Bugs Bunny.        
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzi Buddy is a deskmate program.  A deskmate is a small program that places a (ususally animated) character on the user's desktop.  Again, the only purpose of these types of programs is to amuse.  Bonzi Buddy in particular places a cartoonish purple ape on the user's desktop.
<BR>

<BR>
Flash is a widely-used programming language.  Flash is used for various purposes, such as games [ http://www.electrotank.com ] , small movies/animations, and to create a totally different look for webpages.  There is nothing remotely malicious about Flash, let me assure you.  For more information about Flash, please visit http://www.macromedia.com
<BR>

<BR>
3)  As programs (especially games) tend to grow larger and more complicated with each new release, more "horsepower" is needed to run those programs.  Computer upgrades are common and are sometimes necessary to run newer programs.
<BR>

<BR>
4)  The fact that your son was spending over half-an-hour using the Internet is no indication that he is involved in computer hacking.  Again, computer games are the reason most youths spend a large amount of time using computers.  Chatting and innocent web surfing are also common pasttimes for young Internet users.
<BR>

<BR>
5)  I have no idea who told you that Quake is "an online virtual reality used by hackers", but whoever did so either recieved erroneous information from another source or completely fabricated the entire description.  As mentioned above in several of the user comments, Quake is first person shooter (or FPS), a genre of video game in which the player sees the action through the eyes of the main character.  This is opposed to another genre of games in which the player-controlled character is fully visible on the screen during play.
<BR>
     Also, the link between violence portrayed in video games and the effects thereof on the player's behavioral tendencies has yet to be proven.  Many of the "studies" published should be more carefully investigated before being trusted, as many of these studies are too dated to hold much relevance and contain enormous leaps of logic in connecting the two.
<BR>

<BR>
6)  Many of the behavioral changes you noticed in your son are not at all connected to computer usage.  Drastic changes in attitude are almost certainly natural changes that all teenagers experience.  Remember, teenagers have always been described as "rebelious" (not a term I would use to describe your son, based on the information available), even long before personal computers existed.
<BR>

<BR>
7)  Linux, like Windows, is an Operating System, or OS.  An OS basically serves to provide an interface between the user and the computer, reading data and interpreting that data to display what you see on your screen.  Linux is popular mainly because it is a free Operating System (unlike Windows) and it also has many other advantages over the Windows OS, such as increased stability (computers running Linux then to crash less often).
<BR>

<BR>
8)  MP3 is not a program but a type of computer data file.  The MP3 file format allows for very large sound files (usually music) to be compressed into music smaller, readable files (with little loss of sound quality).  There are literally hundreds of programs dedicated to the exchange of MP3s on the Internet.  Much of the newscoverage concerning the trading of MP3s has to do with musical artists filing lawsuits because the trading of their intellectual property (their music) is a copyright violation.
<BR>
     Before jumping to any conclusions, however, you should understand that the sharing and trading of MP3s over the Internet is very much akin to the copying of a rented video casette tape.  Copying videotapes is certainly against the law, but a lot of people do it (many without even knowing they are breaking the law).
<BR>

<BR>
9)  The provided description over physical changes to look out for in one's children is not that of the typical hacker, but of a category of people known as "ravers".  Ravers take the name from all-night parties called "raves".  Rave parties sometimes (but certainly not always) involve the use of a relatively new designer
<BR>
drug called "Ecstacy".  This is a very dangerous substance that is responsible for the deaths of many youths.  Also, to a true ecstacy-using raver, the pacifier worn around the neck is carried because ecstacy causes the user to involuntarily clamp his or her teeth together.  The pacifier is carried so that when this happens, the drug user has something to bite down on.
<BR>

<BR>
10) There could be numerous explainations for poor academic performance, none of which are remotely related to hacking.  I would suggest talking to one's children about poor grades in a calm, non-threatening manner (note: be prepared- as a 19 year-old college student I speak from experience when I say that most children will be very defensive when it comes to discussing poor academic performance because they interpret parental concern to be heated accusation).
<BR>

<BR>
     Finally, I would like to leave you with some of my personal experience with computer hackers.  While it is true that there are people that will use computer hacking as a means to commit crimes, not all hackers are attempting to do so.  
<BR>
     Let me give you an example that frankly suprised me.  Once, in surfing a web forum dedicated to hacking, a user posted a message asking for a cracked version of a program ("cracking" is the process of disecting a program's code and altering it, in some cases to, say, remove a nag screen from a shareware program or to provide access to a full program without buying it).  Almost immediatedly a response was made by a resident hacker who barraded the other user, explaining that most real hackers do not hack program code in oprder to break the law, but in order to become more familiar with programming code as a whole.  Indeed, one of the best ways to aquaint oneself with code is to inspect computer viruses (NOT transmit them) and to learn how they work.  Angrily stating that obtaining illegal "free" stuff is not at all what hacking is about, the hacker (and several others who made response posts) barraded the user, who to my knowledge hasn't returned to that forum since.
<BR>

<BR>
     The term "hacker" is largely misused by compter users.  The term refers to individuals who (by learning to the built-in security measures found in many programs) teach themselves much about program code and basically how programs are built.  It's interesting to note that a large number of hackers go on to work for computer security companies, testing and writing the programs that you and I use to protect our computers.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

People enjoy things like that, and you cant say because someone plays a game they are a hacker, or something of that sort...what kind of a fool are you?  Im glad you dont have problems with your kids, neither do my parents...and i spend roughly 6 to 7 hours a day on the computer when i can, and i do all sorts of things, and so what?  That doesnt mean im a hacker...maybe i am...maybe im not...you dont know that...and you cant base it on a crappy sheet of ten piece of crap suggestions...you are the most rediculous person i know in that fashion...oh man...i had a friend send me a message linking me to this, saying we should hang you by your nads!! HAHAHA...and by the way...the quake community says BOO! and oh i didnt even finish reading your post, DOSing..hahahahahahaahhahahaha...funny stuff, DOS for your information is used to run servers and create shells for certain servers and types of programs that needs them, it is also a vital tool in finding problems your ISP.  I am a very big gamer online, and i have changed ISP's oh maybe six to seven times, WHY you may ask?  DUHHHH!!!! SPEED IS WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT!!! as ISP's become more popular, they become slower, which should make sense to you, and you need speed in order to game in quick games like quake or half-life...its all about the speed...and you change isps for that...my god man...go away and dont post anything else like this ever again, its pathetic!

second any person that knows anything about computers would not use bonzi buddy, or commet curser, and by the way flash is for viewing certain web pages.

third  If any one wants a new video card, it is not for breaking into computer systems, it is for video games, or high end graphics.  As for AMD they are the best chip makers in the world.  They are not made in the third world, unless Texas in not a member of the USA.

I am so proud of my 10 year old daughter.  She will NEVER be a hacker.  Just today a friend gave her some nice educational software.  All he did was stick his disk in the machine, and made her a copy!!  What a nice boy!
<BR>
I understand there are some very wonderful places on the internet that you can donate money to.  Estonia seems to be a great place for this honorable activity.  I commend them.
<BR>
The other night my 7 year old son asked, "Daddy, what's that!"
<BR>
I told him that someone who must think a lot about him and his values sent him e-mail without asking.  The lady must be homeless because she can't even afford to wear clothes.  
<BR>
So we clicked on the link and gave our credit card.  They take an automatic donation each month and we can go look at their listings of homeless women.  One lady seems to be doing well.  She has a male friend who lost his clothes as well, and they are obviously best friends.
<BR>
It's like my friend who gave me a special version of windows that we are allowed to put on all our comptuers..."You can't be too careful".
<BR>
I'd like to brag some more, but my daughter has to go meed "Uncle" ernie.  She met him in a chat room last night, and he has some holiday treats for her.  So I have to get her bike tire pumped up so she can ride it across town to see her new buddy.
<BR>
We will be upgrading next month when we get our check for sending all those emails to test out Bill Gates new mail forwarding service!!  Talk to you then!

Lunix is really linux, and is a Operating system like windows. If your son is dressing like that and have a pacifier in his mouth, hes doing extascy. Comet Cursor is stupid, it changes what your mouse pointer looks like. Bonzai Buddy hmm is like AIM which is made by AOL which you love; it is a chat program. Aol is just a ISP(internet service provider) that gives really bad service for the price. Flash is a Web site production program that you can buy in the stores. AMD is a reliable chip manufacturer, and the INTEL chips i have are made in the PHILLIPINES.  DOSing does not take 8 hours to do it to some one; most people have dial up connections and could just pull the phone cord out to stop it.  And you son becoming arguementitive is probably because of the DRUGS hes using(exstacy, or he just does like having a DICK for a dad. "Lunix",Mandrake, Bsd are all operating systems that you can either purchase in a store or online at a reliable site. TELNET thats the funniest part. TELNET is a program thats on your computer right now and about 85% of all the computers in the world right now.  It is a program that Microsoft puts on every operating system. Yes people do use it for hacking but it is not usefull to the true h4ck3r.   I have never heard of anybody getting menegetis from using the computer too much. Menegetis is a deadly bacteria which could be found on the mouse or keyboard or a public computer.  Thats all i have for now
<BR>

<BR>
oh yea  Be a real Dad and get your self some help to help out your famil.

<BR>

<BR>
I find your article and posting very very disturbing.  For all reading this let me start out by saying I am not a parent, I don't have kids.  I am a freshmen in college and I have been using computers since I was 8 years old.
<BR>

<BR>
By the criteria posted in the article I meet all of the 9 of the 10 properties listed.  Am I hacker?
<BR>

<BR>
With regards to number one, and changing ISPs there are many legitimate reasons for wanting to change ISPs and get away from AOL.  Depending on where you live, you may not have access to AOL broadband, as you point out in your article, AOL is restrictive and provides parental controls and such.  Well I've never had the parental controls problem as I've been the one with the computer with dad just paying the internet bill and I even had AOL for a time before I switched to compuserve then to a local ISP. If you are a user who wants to get onto the net truly for the net then AOL is a hinderance as AOL is a service, which has a portal to the internet available.   You have special software, and if youa re into performance, be it for web authoring, chatting, or research, AOL can provide slwo service beyond belief.  Wanting to switch ISPs for the sole purpose of switching is ridicilous.  I had a friend whose older brother every time a new review about an ISP came out he would switch because one month AOL would be better then Compuserve, then Earthlink would be the creme of the crop, then it would be ATAT worldnet.   Switching ISPs does not mean anything, unless you are tyring to get away from something.   AOL is actually one of the easier ISPs to remain anonymous from when going out to the net.  To AOLs credit though, they do have a good abuse department. 
<BR>

<BR>
#2) Software
<BR>
 You list: "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash".    Lets see, Flash is installed with a lot of freeware apps, Flash is used on webpages, and similar things.   If you are truly concerned about not installing software, get Windows 2000 or XP, setup that you have to have a username and password, give the kid user permissions and then he can't change the computers settings. 
<BR>

<BR>
#3) New Hardware
<BR>
You don't need the latest and greatest hardware to cause damage.   I would love to know how having a Gforce3 graphics card and a new 21" Silicon Graphics monitor would mean I'm a serious hacker and not just a serious gamer, or web developer.
<BR>

<BR>
#4) Reading Material:
<BR>
You quote:
<BR>
Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond. 
<BR>

<BR>
as being hacking manuals.  I've not read every one of these books but I did use Hackers to inspire a few research papers in high school which if you will read, You will find that it is much more of a history book and lesson then a hacking manual.   I have "Programming with Perl" down stairs in my car along with my JavaScript reference, my printed Java API, my MCSE study guide, my TCP/IP networking reference.   Did you ever think your son may be doing serve side web development?  Perl is a powerful language that can do many many things.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Quake and Social Behavior and time on the computer:
<BR>
Myself and many others spend the majority of our week infront of the computers.  I've played it once or twice, nothing special.  Dont' confuse a popular game for hacking trainign grounds.  Whats next are all games that require high end hardware evil because the network environment in which they can be played promotes hacking?   Off base as it may be, have you considered the fact that maybe you as a parent maynto be listening to your child if he feels the need to withdraw into cyberspace to find friends?  Or maybe he hates team sports and sports in general and feels at home in front of a computer.   Are you sir unable to accept new ideas?
<BR>

<BR>
Obsessions with Linux
<BR>
Linux is a truly amazing operating system and is not illegal.  It is a spin off that is more user friendly of the g-d of all older systems called Unix be it from Berkley or Bell Labs.  Without Unix I doubt the nice user friendly point and click interface infront of you would be available today.   Linux is complex and superior in many ways, it is a bear to learn.    Lilo is a loader that lets you switch between operating systems such as windows and linux.  What you refer to about deleting windows would be changing the FAT system on the hard drive from a Windows/DOS fat system to linux one.  Its a dangerous install for novices and deleting windows may not even be intentional.   
<BR>

<BR>
Changing Appearance:
<BR>
Has the thought of peer pressure and hormones occurred to you.  Turn on the TV mister, look at how teens dress.   In the mean time, you sir are the parent, and you control the clothing your children have.  My parents refused to let me dress in grunge.  I went to school wearing white socks, khakis, denham or navy pants or shorts and a polo style (or equivalent) shirt to school everyday since 4th grade until I was here at college where high cost hard to wash shirts like that just are not feasible for a college student.  You don't need to be a hacker to change your appearance, you need daddy's credit card.
<BR>

<BR>
Academics:
<BR>
Some kids are not good at french and english.   My GPA went up after I got rid of French and xGenre Literature and could take science electives and interesting history electives.  Love for computers though always remained constant and sometimes it was more important.  Have you thought you may be pushing school to hard and forcing your child into the depths of cyber space.   Emphasis not only by parents but by society is put in the wrong places, encourage the use of a computer as a learnign tool, not a toy and don't prohibit the use of the damn thing.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Now something about hackign and the nature of it because from your article its unclear what you mean and up to this point I've been making an assumption that you are using the negative connonation of the word hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
From the book you quote above, Hackers, I quote the hacker ethic:  Access to computers -- and anything which might teach you somethign about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!(page 40)
<BR>

<BR>
I would like to note in there never does it say anything bad but it promotes learning and seeking information.   If you want to learn the true nature of hacking learn programming, write some code, study some code, make something useful, view the source of a webpage, figure out what makes that nify scrolling thing.  You sir just became a hacker.   A hacker can be anybody who uses a computer on a technical level.  So everybody out there who has ever made a webpage, you are a hacker.  Have you done something bad or wrong?
<BR>

<BR>
So many people use the term so wrong these days, hacking, hacker, hack.   You should use the term cracking, crack and cracker.   Those have the right connonation and mean doing something bad with computers.    I am sure your research revealed this and you just did not want to point the difference out.
<BR>

<BR>
So your son says he is a hacker, ask to see his work.   Tell him you want to see that website he made, turn the term positive.
<BR>

<BR>
Now if you want to stop these "hackign" activities, I would suggest the following:
<BR>
1) Lose AOL and get a broadband connection (no I've not lost my mind)
<BR>
2) On said broad band connection get a linsys router (or similar) and disable the DHCP features (look it up) and use static IPs and give your computer a static IP address.
<BR>
3) use the filtering and forwarding features and only allow information on port 80 (HTTP i.e. web browsing only).   By disabling all of these ports except the one used for web, you can't transfer files through other means besides the web, you can't play network games of quake, you can't get onto chat networks and do lots of other stuff which I'm not going to go into here.
<BR>

<BR>
True you can still surf to hacking websites, but if you use my suggestion on user level permissions and prohibit reconfiguring the ocmputer and then use the itnernet explorer internet level settings, combined with something like netnanny...
<BR>

<BR>
...of course thats if you mean hackign to be negative.  However I could take your message to mean something very positive from what you've suggested using the hacker ethic.  Ever occurred that your son is a hacker trying to learn more just to learn more?

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">     I hope to god that this is a joke. I would hate to think that there is actually someone on this planet with so very little intelligence as to make those comments. In the extremist case that I am dealing with an actual moron of such amazing caliber, I have a few things I'd like to say.
<BR>
     We'll skip past the utter humiliation you've placed upon yourself, calling yourself an enlightened, modern parent! I lost my composure, let me continue. You claim to have researched this problem for days, but if you had ever even tried to verify any of the information you provided with an authority, like a manufacturer, or a customer service representative, you would have seen you did not state one fact you proclaimed, so vehemently, correctly. Let me go through your list one by one, and show you the errors you have made.
<BR>

<BR>
1. AOL is not anywhere near a good internet service provider, in my opinion. If your son asked you for a better one, that is probably because he is tired of disconnections, slow connections, and the fact that it is a horribly slow program to run.
<BR>

<BR>
2. "Comet Cursor" is a program easily downloaded from many kinds of legal internet sites. Macromedia's "Flash" is imperitive to run streaming cartoon-like movies available on perfectly safe children's websites like www.disney.com and www.cartoonnetwork.com
<BR>

<BR>
3. I cannot believe that you actually think asking for an upgrade to your computer constitutes hacking. Upgrades of memory, hard drive space, and video cards do not do anything new that your same hardware doesn't do already. All it does it work faster, and better. Contact any one of those manufacturers and they will tell you all about their product.
<BR>

<BR>
4. I admit I have read none of these so-called "manuals," but I am more a fan of Tolkein and Steinbeck myself. And I have never seen any books on any bookshelves anywhere that describe how to do anything illeagal. That in itself is illeagal.
<BR>

<BR>
5. The internet is a very enormous place to explore. If someone plays the same game for hours, the only worry you should have is that he might get a headache from the eye strain. And as a footnote, the word "DOS" has never before in my knowledge been used as a verb.
<BR>

<BR>
6. This is ludicrous. Quake is a game. You might as well blame America's recent recession on the game "Monopoly."
<BR>

<BR>
7. I never met a male that did not become argumentative and surly at that age. And he has right to be when it seems you have grounded him for having a hobby that he shares with millions of other healthy Americans- video games.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Linux is like any other software, it has no real base on anything physical. Its impossible for software to destroy a hard disk; all you have to do is re-install windows afterward, which your son can do even if you cannot (and you can watch him to make sure he doesn't assassinate anyone with a keyboard, or whatever else you seem to think he is capable of).
<BR>

<BR>
9. Dressing like a punk has nothing to do with hacking. Kids try to dress unique, that is all. I do not see the correlation between hair color, and hacking skills. If hackers are so anti-social, why should they care what they look like?
<BR>

<BR>
10. Computer Radiation? I spend between 10 and 15 hours a day on the computer (most of which is at work) and I'm pleased to say I expect to make honor roll this semester at school, which I go to thrice weekly after I work a full time job. If anyone would suffer mentally, it would be me; yet I suffer from nothing, save a healthy hobby that is far more stimulating to the mind than television (reading silly articles like this).
<BR>

<BR>
I'd like to close with an apology to your son. He seems a good kid, and spends time doing something he enjoys, and if he's lucky, will land him a job as a technician when he's older. He does not deserve to be punished for nothing more than your ignorance. If you, or anyone reading this would like to contact me, email me at bluemarage@hotmail.com

You like Windows and Microsoft, don't ya? Another thing.. AMD Processors aren't illegal or bad. They happen to be much better and faster than an intel P4 2 GHz. (Something you wounldn't know about.) And if your son as asked to swtich ISPs from AOL to anything else. GOOD. Aol is stupid. Did you know they sell your credit card info if someone wants it? I think I might buy a few credit cards from them while I'm at it.. Half their staff are just a bunch of kids who think that they are cool cause they have master aol accounts. Also.. Lunix isn't illegal or bad, all that is a unix based Operating System. Guess what? I'm going to use Lunix to steal your credit cards instead of buying them from AOL.

Do you let him wipe his own ass?  Your child is not a hacker, but your paranoia and obseessive parenting are going to guarantee that he will grow up to have deap seated emotional problems that years of therapy will only begin to assuage.  Perhaps you should let him think for himself a little and he will surprise you; although it might be too late for that, at this point he may just be desperate, looking for any chance to rebel. 
<BR>
     I have a little bit of trouble with this type of parenting.  Next week I'm turning 18, and my parents are pretty much done with me outside of helping me pay tuition.  My parents were very liberal in raising me, and I think I'm a pretty decent kid.  As not to toot my own horn, I'll use my sister as an example, she's now 22, she graduated from UC Berkeley last year, she's working in Washington DC right now; she did very well in school throughout her life, and never got into much trouble.  My parents never inspected what books she was reading, never watched over her shoulder as she was using the computer or watching tv, never told her which friends she could be with.  My parents instilled good values and judgement in her early, and didn't have to treat her like a prisoner for the rest of your life.  
<BR>
     Perhaps you should try and trust that what you've taught your son early on will allow him to make his own decisions and just leave him alone.  Talk to him, don't interrogate him.  Hang out with him, don't 'moniter' him.  Be his friend, not his Hitler.  
<BR>
    Oh, and as was said several times before, to anyone who knows anything about computers in general, your outline was a joke.

AMD isn't a haxor compony!  And moron, it aint LUNIX its Linux, and many companies use that.  And most people need to use a computer for more than 30 mins a day.  And there are things called DoS Dinial of service.  It isn't DOSING, in these they flood servers with requests until they explode.  Why don't you get a life and clue into what real haxors do?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">     Firstly my good sir, allow me to say youre a moron. You jump to conclusions, have NO backing for half those things and have plenty of miss information. For the record, "bonzi buddy" is a search engine and second "commet cursor" is a CURSOR changing program. whoa. deep hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
     Keep also in mind that you steriotype hackers by wearing "Bright clothing and spiky hair!". that is complete and utter CRAP. I know plenty of kids (I myself am 16) who have the ability to hack and do not dress like christmas trees. Saying that is like saying "your son can be identified as a theif by a black mask, white and black stripped overalls and a fetish with cigar smoking." Youre constant insistance that all hackers are boys also strikes me as sexist.
<BR>

<BR>
     On a more personal note, no, you are not the ideal parent. In fact, a parent like yourself has a better chance of screwing their kid up. Youre restrictive, nosey and overprotective. If you had raised your children properly, you would not not need to listen to their music and such for them. They would have the insight needed to discifer between right and wrong themselves (and im asuming that your son, peter, is old enough to do so if he is old enough to "hack".)
<BR>

<BR>
     Going to their parties to check for alcohol is simply ridiculous. There is no way to stop them from drinking if they choose to do so, and by being so overprotective as to make an appearence at one of their parties is probably one of the worst things you can do, as it will possible attract ridicule to them. Believe me, if a kid wants to drink it is not hard for them to do so. And what are you to do if they ARE drinking? ground them? soon they will realize that no, you are not god, and disobey you. Then what? kick them out of the house? You need to understand that they will soon be adults and it is best not to police them but rather educate them so that they can make the proper decisions in their lives and thus be in control of them.
<BR>

<BR>
     As a final note, do more research before you publish something like this, because you come off as a complete and utter moron by saying falsities like "Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms." that could not be farther from the truth. For all those parents out there who read this and took it with more than a grain of salt, quake is a first-person computer which can be played over the internet. Players fight with one another in simulated arenas using a variety of weapons. it is in no way a "training ground" for violence. it is simple amusement, a more advanced version of cowboys and indians where no one is really hurt. Whats more, the online site where the players interact is in no way for hackers, simply many individuals who DO hack play a lot of games on the computer.
<BR>

<BR>
PS: also understand: TRUE hacking is VERY hard to preform and i refuse to believe for a moment that this mans son is in any way a true hacker. it takes an incredible amount of knowledge, time, understanding and education to properly hack to any effect, and what his child is most certainly doing is tinkering.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Mr. Gibbons, you obviously are completely computer illiterate and should not even be allowed to operate a computer, much less own one. Before I tear you to pieces, let me state that I have been working with computers since I was twelve years old. I am now pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. You may reach me at miller26@muohio.edu if you would like to defend yourself - assuming you can. Let the critique begin:<BR><BR>

<cite>I was content to bow to her experience as a mother, until our youngest daughter, Cindy, charged into the living room one night to blurt out: "Peter is a computer hacker!"</cite><BR><BR>

Well, thank goodness you're trusting the uneducated opinion of your youngest daughter. I bet she doesn't know any more than you do about computers. But this, really, is a minor point.<BR><BR>

<cite>After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking</cite><BR><BR>

Would you mind listing some of your sources? If I ever, <b>ever</b> wrote an article like this for my college classes and didn't have any documentation for my research, I would be laughed out of the classroom with an F. Citing your sources of information gives you credibility. I suggest you do so to support your ten signs of being a hacker. Or are you unable to? I thought so.<BR><BR>

<cite>1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs?</cite><BR><BR>

Has it ever occured to you that - No, wait, I'm not ever going to ask. It obviously <b>hasn't</b> occured to you that there are many reasons to change ISPs. The frequency of busy signals ( for dial-up modems ) and available bandwidth, as well as frequency of disconnects. Some services are much worse than others.<BR><BR>

<cite>2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?</cite><BR><BR>

Oh god no. Please. The horror. It's so obvious that any program you don't install yourself is a hacker program.<BR><BR>

I hope you're recognizing the sarcasm. Just because you don't install the program doesn't mean that it has anything to do with illegal activities. You're a moron.<BR><BR>

<cite>3. Has your child asked for new hardware?</cite><BR><BR>

Everyone wants new hardware. Why? More is better. Faster is better. Certain toys are fun to have, such as a scanner, web-cam, etc. They have nothing to do, inherently, with hacking. Again, you're just a moron.<BR><BR>

<cite>4. Does your child read hacking manuals?</cite><BR><BR>

This is the first point that you've made that actually has some merit. However, I have read hacking manuals myself and still do not perform illegal activities. They are an excellent source of information on a variety of topics, information that may not be available elsewhere. Then again, who is to say that you correctly identified these texts as hacker manuals? Which texts exactly are you referring to? Can you give names?<BR><BR>

<cite>5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?</cite><BR><BR>

This means the person is a hacker? Well, geeze. I spend about eight hours a day using mine, yet I seem to be able to refrain from illegal activities. Strange. Also, has it ever occured to you that, well, heck, computers are just fun? The Internet, games, an outlet for creativity... All of these things mean spending time with the computer, yet they're not hacker related.<BR><BR>

<cite>6. Does your son use Quake?</cite><BR><BR>

Do not speak of things you know nothing about. <cite>Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers.</cite> In reality, Quake is a video game developed by id software ( http://www.idsoftware.com/ ).<BR><BR>

<cite>where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms.</cite> Where they discuss binds, scripts, and strategy for playing Quake.<BR><BR>

<cite>Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world</cite> Can you point me to some research on this?<BR><BR>

<cite>You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away</cite> They should be locked away in any case. You're a parent, even though you haven't the right to be in the gene pool, and if you're so paranoid about your alleged 'hacker' you should have your guns locked up anyway.<BR><BR>

Blah, I think I'm ranting. See what you've made me do?<BR><BR>

<cite>7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?</cite><BR><BR>

Is your son going through puberty?<BR><BR>

<cite>8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?</cite><BR><BR>

Of all the points you've made, this one in particular <b>proves</b> that you are a complete and utter moron. You have no right to write this article.<BR><BR>

Linux is an operating system, similar to but much better ( in my opinion ) than Microsoft Windows. You can learn more about Linux from www.linux.org, www.redhat.com, and www.debian.org . Linux is not based on a Microsoft product, it is based on UNIX which was produced by AT&T ( www.att.com ). It is, perhaps, one of the most popular operating systems used for internet services, such as HTTP, FTP, and Telnet. Then again, I'm sure those three things scare you, so I'll stop. I don't want you to leave yet, I'm not done.<BR><BR>

LINUS TORVALDES lives in SWEDEN. He's SWEDISH. You are STUPID.<BR><BR>

Ah, this actually feels good, making fun of a complete dolt.<BR><BR>

<cite>They may also be used to break into people's stereos</cite> Good god... I swear this article <b>has</b> to be a parody at this point, it's just unbearable. However, I'll continue. It is impossible - aboslutely impossible - to 'break into' a stereo. There are many reasons for this, however the major one is THE COMPUTER AND THE STEREO ARE NOT NETWORKED TOGETHER. Oh, and you're an idiot. :P
<BR><BR>
<cite>If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix.</cite><BR><BR>

Actually, LILO starts BEFORE windows. Also, LILO doesn't necessarily mean that Linux is installed on the computer. I can be used to load any operating system. Are you scared? You shouldn't be, but you are. You're an idiot.<BR><BR>

<cite>In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface.</cite><BR><BR>

Yes, you <b>ARE</b> a moron. I'm not even going to touch this one, it's getting late for me and I need to sleep soon.<BR><BR>

<cite>9. Has your son radically changed his appearance?</cite><BR><BR>

Has your son entered puberty? Has your son started hanging out with different people? Has your son started listening to different music? Has your son any chance of growing up mentally undamaged?<BR><BR>

<cite>10. Is your son struggling academically?</cite><BR><BR>
Maybe he's stupid. Maybe he's playing too many video games. Maybe he's bored and needs new challenges. Maybe you're an idiot.<BR><BR>

<cite>Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain</cite> GIVE ME CREDIBLE SOURCES.<BR><BR>


<cite>It cannot be taken too seriously.</cite><BR><BR>

Yes it can. You just did.<BR><BR>

In fact, I just did to. This thing is just too stupid to not be a joke. But I felt like bitching at someone ( bad day ) and you were such an easy target...

<BR>

<BR>
I'll respond to each offending quotation or just individual "warning signs" at large.
<BR>

<BR>
1. "Has your son asked you to change ISPs?" 
<BR>

<BR>
AOL projects the image that they provide the safest internet experience for children. Based on the time I spent using AOL, this projection is very misleading. When I was on AOL, I got tons of junk mail and the majority of it was for adult sites. This was puzzling since I had never visited any of these kinds of sites before recieving the emails for them. Also, if you keep a personal profile, the information in that profile is availalble to anyone. This is probably the most valued resource for pedaphiles. A directory of children that lists their location, age, sex, and interests would be useful to trick a child into thinking your someone their age with the same interests.
<BR>

<BR>
One might want to change thier ISP from AOL because almost every ISP is faster doesn't bombard the user with advertisement pop-up windows at every corner. 
<BR>

<BR>
Don't believe the hype.
<BR>

<BR>
2. "Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". "
<BR>

<BR>
I have no idea what Bonzi Buddy is, but Comet Cursor is a program that let's you change your cursor (that litte arrow on your screen that you move with your mouse) into a different picture. For example, if your son or daughter was into baseball, he or she might change it from an arrow to a baseball bat. Totally harmless. Flash is an animation software used by a very large number of commercial websites. This has absoolutly no relationship to hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
3. "Has your child asked for new hardware? "
<BR>
New computer games have very detailed 3D graphics which require better graphics cards and more memory as they become more advanced. Hackers will find no benifit from a graphics card and little benifit from more memory.
<BR>

<BR>
4."Does your child read hacking manuals? "
<BR>
Many of the books listed are manuals for computer programming used by professionals.
<BR>

<BR>
5."Does your son use Quake? "
<BR>
Quake is a game where you run around and shoot zombie like creatures. This has as much to do with hacking as Ms. Packman has to do with terrorism.
<BR>

<BR>
6. "BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War." I don't think any operating system is illegal or specifically meant for hackers. It sounds like this child wants to learn more about programming.
<BR>

<BR>
7. "Has your son radically changed his appearance? "
<BR>
If I hear this as warning sign one more time I'm going to start throwing things. A change of appearance doesn't mean anything. Many of the specific changes listed are just popular amoung kids today.
<BR>

<BR>
8. "f your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association."
<BR>

<BR>
HA HA HA HA HA HA
<BR>
Otakus are Japanese Animation fans. They have nothing to do with hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
Whoever wrote this has no idea what he's talking about and I feel very sorry for his children who are being punished for their fathers lack of knowledge about just about everything having to do with computers, the internet, and youth culture in general.
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry kids.

By the way, one other way you can tell if your son is a hacker is if he asks to upgrade your memory. Your computer doesn't really need memory to run, but hackers need lots of memory because it helps them hack into things... yeah. That's what hackers do, right?

Not only are you pathetically unaware of teen culture or style today, you lack any sort of real trust in your son. As so many other comments have pointed out, you lack any knowledge of computer equipment, software, or hardware. As far as your "warning signs" are concerned, were you never a teenager? Most kids change their appearance, become sulky, and occasionally experience problems in school--it's called "growing up." I am certainly relieved that when I received my new AMD processor it did not come equipped with a few "Third World" sweatshop employees to take care of. And, briefly, what makes you an authority on raising children. I hope that no loving parents will take your ignorant and ill-informed advice. If they do, it will be to the detriment of their own kids. And, by the way, women are just as capable as men of using computers and excelling in computer related fields, you sexist bastards. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking.

Dear author(s) of the posts defending this ... blatent waste of good bandwidth 
<BR>

<BR>
You're idiots.  Online gaming is far less tyranical and mind altering than oh.. say.. cheerleading or high school football.  The pressure of modern society to "fit in" this all comsuming rage in which anything not you, your family, and doesn't conform to your ideals is a thing of pure and utter evil.  Tell me that humanity has not reached THIS LEVEL of cess pool ignorance.  "Hackers have glowsticks" bbbzzttt WRONG .  RAVERS carry Glow sticks.  As to the type of music, you'd prolly have us all listening to Disney songs all day long while reading a bible and not watching TV because it too is a cause of "hacking" right?  Let me tell you a thing or two that's not mentioned here.
<BR>

<BR>
1) Hacking is a term used by online games for anyone using a cheat in a game.  Example? Cheats that allow you to remove textures and see through walls are called "wallhacks" 
<BR>

<BR>
2) I grew up in a household in which someone held many of the same ideals as the author if this incrediously funny article.  I grew up in it and I honestly hated every minute of it.   I was oppressed and denied the thing that seperates humans from the rest of the animals in the world.  Free will.  
<BR>

<BR>
To supress the ideals and likes of other human beings is wrong, at least to the level in which the author of this article has stated.  You claim that computers are downfall of humanity? I hate to inform you thaty ou're wrong.
<BR>

<BR>
Humanity is the downfall of humanity.
<BR>

<BR>
It's people like you, Conformity happy personality nazi's that make people like myself (read as, person with a brain) shun to go to a public place (like a mall for example).  
<BR>

<BR>
Wow... i just was reading this, and i've been rambling.. guh.. must be all that 'speed' in my system (read that as Wow.. i've been drinking a coke.  Heaven forbid that I drank a high sodium carbonated beverage and just "happen" to be posting on a forumn at the same time.  Tsk tsk )
<BR>
so.. without further adieu I'm gonna go uh.. hack i guess.
<BR>

<BR>
If... by hack you mean play a video game involving guns, strategy, and friends.  Excuse me, i have a base to go defend.

Thanks to this article, I was able to spot my son hacking using a program called "mIRC" (A program designed by a wanted british computer hacker who goes by the alias of "Khaled"). Luckily, I have steered him clear of such illegal activity, and he is making sound progress at school.

1)AMD are sold in stores as a matter of fact BestBuy use to sell them.

2)Quake is a damn game thats it.

3) You really need to learn what the hell a hacker is. All a hacker is, is someone who knows how a computer works in and out. I myself am a hacker and damn proud of it. 
<BR>
4) What you are talkin about is a Haxor. 
<BR>
5) Here is what the Firewall Dictionary says
<BR>
Hacker: Motivated largely by curiosity, hackers are people who probe computer and phone systems to figure out how they work and what kind of information they hold. Hackers are generally principled and don't cause hard to the systems they invade. Haxor: Also know as Crackers,haxors are the evil twins of hackers. Haxors revel in breaking copy protections, damaging networks, stealing and/or altering data, and generally being unpleasant. They began referring to themselves as haxors, or HaX0rs, to aviod being blocked by ISPs, online services, and message boards that automatically delete references to "hackers"

check yoru spelling and you think that is what makes a hacker? you need ''LUNIX'' and be an avid Quake player? you really didn't research this at all... ''LUNIX'' does not destroy your HD, I have installed and uninstalled many times - guess what, I am on the same HD. GO FIGURE!

<BR>

<BR>
-AOL is the suckiest ISP in the world, so if a kid asks to change ISP, thats actually a good idea.
<BR>

<BR>
-Those programs he claims are "hacker programs"... Geez! ask someone who knows about PC�s a you will see.
<BR>

<BR>
-I don't know why a hacker needs to upgrade his Video Card to do his stuff. That is just nonesense. And AMD is a legitimate company, not a third world evil empire.
<BR>

<BR>
-Those books he lists as Hacking manuals... They are novels (well, most of them), fiction stories (good fiction, in the case of Neuromancer).
<BR>

<BR>
-45 minutes at day with the PC? Rubbish. What they are going to learn?
<BR>

<BR>
-Quake is a game, for God's sake. And a old one. Hackers talk and plan their stuff on IRC channels or ICQ, not playing Quake.
<BR>

<BR>
-The whole point of a child's behavior being an alert signal is a moot one. It�s normal for a Pre-Adolscent child to have some behavior problems, so deal with it. 
<BR>

<BR>
-It�s Linux. It dosn't have anything to do with Soviet Union (hehe, that was a good one), and yes, it's the work of a group of hackers, and thanks to them, there is a option if you want another OS instead of Windows. And it�s free.
<BR>

<BR>
-Hackers tend to wear black clothes, but only the "pro" ones. Most hackers are just normal people.
<BR>

<BR>
-"over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases" WTF? that is just rubbish. And hackers tend to be very succesful people, with high paid jobs.

You name such programs as Comet Cursor and Flash as 'hacking' programs. However, Comet Cursor is a desktop accessory desgined to make a computer user's time on the computer more enjoyable and customised, through use of animated cursors. Flash is used to create animations which are used extensively on webpages. None of the actions these programs perform are harmful or illegal - in fact they are great creative tools which improve the internet. Flash is even taught to senior students at my school in Information Processing and Technology. As a 16 year old, I consider myself a computer enthusiast, using advanced features and spending time on the internet. However, you would class me as a 'hacker'.
<BR>

<BR>
Your view is painfully conservative, and ignorant, and I feel it is people like you who prevent real positive progress on frontiers such as computers and the internet.

Please get real.

I'm currently a student in telecommunication and networks. you can call me a hacker if you think every people working on a computer are (but far from it...).
<BR>

<BR>
I'm well informed about computers, and hacking....
<BR>

<BR>
You present yourself as a modern and computer-science informed parent, but you don't know anything !!! You just start to learn some things on a computer, and never go far enough to really understand them. AMD, a third-world company !!!!
<BR>

<BR>
What sort of book do you read ? Magazine ?
<BR>
Do you realize that without computer, the actual society is lost ? Is there a single person in the developped country who never see a computer, or something related ?
<BR>

<BR>
Do you really think that someone who know programming will always try to hack companies, or anyone ?
<BR>

<BR>
Please, before you do anything, go read computer related magazine, go to the internet, get inform about AMD, LINUX, all those thing you don't know.

<BR>

<BR>
There are few big mistakes in That post for ex. Linus torvald is not from Russia he`s from finland and the OS. is called linux not "lunix" and it`s not based on any kind of microsoft aplication, Its Based on UNIX witch was created in 1969 in Bell Labs and first start of this system was on the DEC PDP-7(evrything made in usa)
<BR>
Another Thing hackers don`t need new hardware because hackers work in TXT enviroments wich can be lunched on 386 processor wich hasn`t been producted in years. Why buying AMD processor is sing of being a hacker? That processor is more efficent in games than Intel processor and cheaper so I don`t see the connection betwen a hackers and AMD processors, or why buing new graphic card?? new games require new Graphics accelerators, or what has hackin to do with Quake? i bet 80% of quake community newer iven sow linux or enything what has to do with hacking, they are just playing the game, or why spending more than 45 minutes makes such person a hacker? he may be talking for hours on internet with other pepole using irc, icq, chats, etc. or he may be learning how to use the pc for to be a programist in future or some other computer related job. I don`t se the connection betwen poor preformance in sports, not evrybody hav abilities to be a sportsman some pepole train their brains(thanks to them u can enjoy the benefits of tehnology) not their bodyies.
<BR>
I think the autor of that post is overreacting and is scared of evrything that is realted with computer that he dosen`t know, before writing such article he should contact somebody who can explaind few things that author has no idea of and is writing about them.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Well, since all the above commenters have pointed out the facts of the matter, Linux being a FREE and OPEN operating system made by millions of people all over the world seeking, well, let's call it "Technological Paradise" and everything, I feel theres one thing that's still missing.. Here:
<BR>

<BR>
"As you can imagine, I was amazed. A computer hacker in my own house! I began to monitor my son's habits, to make certain that Cindy wasn't just telling stories, as she is prone to doing at times. 
<BR>

<BR>
After a few days of investigation, and some research into computer hacking, I confronted Peter with the evidence. I'm afraid to say, this was the only time I have ever been truly disappointed in one of my children."
<BR>

<BR>
Now.. first of all, computer users not quite evenly divide into a number of groups: $LUSERS (Normal users that think that what the computer does is magic), Script-Kiddies (Kids that think that breaking the law is cool, but don't have the mental abillity to actually do so), Crackers (Sometimes called 'black-hat hackers', are Computer-Literates that use computer Cracking to forward their political oppinions, amongst other things) and finally Hackers.. well there are other groups, but these are the most important ones..
<BR>
Hackers are good. Hackers make software, hackers write books, hackers do whatever they can to entertain their own mentallity by doing things that other people have deemed impossible. Hackers are very often anti-social, but that's not because they want to be different, it's normally because society as a social construct won't allow us to participate in normal social rituals without being sessed uppon with menial mockery. Hackers are intellectually superior to the "average" person, I'm sorry to say, and Hackers hate mediocrity for what it is. Our school grades are either top-grades or propper flunks, the top grades because we can, and the propper flunks because we simply don't want to. Most educational systems serve simply as a way to slow our mental evolution down to that of our peers, and trust me when I say that we do not like that.
<BR>

<BR>
However, to respond to you saying that you are not proud that your son as a Hacker, the note this: Every parent who actually knows what a Hacker is and what our purpose in society is would be proud. Hackers are the most ethicly clean people that I know - the thing that makes them 'bad' is that they don't let governments tell them what to do. Guess what the governments do?
<BR>

<BR>
I too am a hacker, like many others. It's estimated that the worlds hacker population is around 10 million people. That number is going up, but then again, not all hackers are good hackers - some break the law (black-hats).. but only for a reason.
<BR>

<BR>
If you want to understand the hacker culture, go down to your bookstore and get a copy of the Harry Potter books. The social struggles in that book, the static between Wizards and Muggles - it's all exactly the same as the Hacker social struggle.. Hackers being Wizards, you being a muggle, and those few crackers that exist being Voldemort and his gang.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, thanks for reading (if you did, but I doubt that also).. and please try not to be so ignorant. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hello,
<BR>
Mr T Reginald Gibbons, as a computer hacker and 14 year old son, I find your article to be completely and utterly away from the facts as possible. A few things about your article. Comet Cursor is a program that allows you to change your mouse cursor to something more visually appealing or more suited to your tastes. Flash is a professional website & animation package used by many people legally around the world to create websites and small, animated movies. They are not hacker software. AMD. How dare you insult AMD in front of me. AMD are a great company that have built themselves up over the years to rival Intel in the processor stakes. Their processors are designed for fast gaming speed and are made legally and to a considerably high standard by well-paid engineers in America. By their very nature, processors cannot be made in sweatshops. Processors are made in very clean, dust-free environment, therefore the idea that you harvest about them being made in sweatshops is not feasable. The security features that you say are missing from AMD chips but evident in Intel chips is this: AMD chips are much more overclockable than their Intel counter-parts. Overclocking is done to get more power and speed from the processor in question. It is NOT illegal and is not hacking. 
<BR>

<BR>
Lunix. Hahaha. It is Linux. It is perfectly legal. It has a 10% share of the operating system market, with Microsoft taking 80% and Apple taking the therefore remaining 10%. It is whats known as open source and was developed by Linus Torvalds (I believe that is how it is spelt) and he has written an autobiography on himself that you can pick up in all good book stores. Mandrake and Debian are in fact versions of Linux. Mandrake and Debian are both relatively easy-to-use and are alternatives to Windows. However, they are not illegal. By modifactions, I mean that it is open source. Linus made Linux open source so that anyone with half a brain can make their own version of Linux suited to their needs. In fact, Linux is non-profit. The entire project is free. Hack into peoples stereos? Please. I can't believe this. You can't hack into someones stereos. MP3 is not a program, either. It is a format for storing music. Remember Napster? Napster is a file-sharing program that was (and still can be) downloaded to be used on the Microsoft Windows operating systems and on Macintosh. In fact, I don't believe there is a version of Napster availble for Linux. Linus did not invent telnet. Telnet has been around since the 1970's.
<BR>

<BR>
You say that if used incorrectly, Linux will ruin your computer and require you to get it fixed by a professional. Not true. Anyone with half a brain can do this. You don't need to pay anyone. Its simple. You just format the hard drive, insert your Windows CD and you are off. Linux also doesn't destory your HDD surface. It simply converts it to a file system known as EXT2, which is what Linux uses and Windows can't read it, without extra programs. Windows uses either FAT32 or NTFS partitions. Linux can't read these. LILO is simple an abbreviated version of Linux Loader. It provides a graphical way of getting into Linux or Windows or anyother OS you have installed.LILO just changes your MBR (master boot partition) which is a portion of your hard drive that contains what to boot and where it is. For example, in Windows, the MBR has data that tells it to boot Windows. It has a program in it the Windows equivalent of LILO. Linux puts LILO in the MBR, which gives you the choice. 
<BR>

<BR>
As for your fashion and appearance statements...well..have you heard of fashion? Spikey hair is the norm, as is baggy pants and bright coloured t-shirts. Glow sticks. Geez. Have you been to any form of night club or even school dance/social lately? They are everywhere. Struggling academically? I wouldn;t call it struggling. I am a hacker and simply find school boring and as such don't get good marks in subjects such as Maths or Science, but I topped the year in English. Why? Because English is the only subject with no bounds except creativity. Maths and Science are bound by annoying things like physics and justifacation. English is truly creative, just like hacking. I hack, but let me clarify this: I don't hack to malicously destory something. I hack to gain knowledge that no teacher can give me. I hack to find out how things work. Hacking isn't limited to computers. A mechanic is a hacker. An advertiser is a hacker. Why? Well, by definition, hacking is abusing a system or law. Abusing, by definition, is pushing something to it's limits, seeing how far it will go before it breaks. A mechanic hacks cars to get better performance from them. An advertiser abuses the human mindset to get them to buy a certain product. Its all hacking. 
<BR>

<BR>
One last thing. Quake is a game that is enjoyed by many people. Like AMD, never insult Quake in front of me. Quake is a sport, not a game. In fact, alot of people live off Quake (well, Quake 3 Arena) and make alot of money or win stuff like new cars. In fact, the CPL (Cyber Athletes Profesional Leaque) is holding the World Championships as we speak for Counter-Strike, the most popular online game ever. It is a tournament with a prize pool of a new Ford ZX3 and $150 000. 
<BR>

<BR>
There you go, Mr T Reginald Gibbons. Go take your self to a PTA meeting or jump off a bridge. Your views are wrong and not valued in society.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It is scary that folks are taking part if not all of this seriously. And then they get all fucked up fighting each other. Who cares about what a fundamentalist psycho thinks about gender issues, OS's or whether you should wear makup and perfume on a date?

What a crack up - and I thought you could only be fundamentalist about religion - but it seems that you can be a computer fundamentalist too! hee hee.

A bishop once said to me that a fundamentalist was funny, daum and mental. And this was coming from a bishop! hee hee

I shudder to think that people can actually believe this alarmist (and totally inaccurate) portrail of hackers.
<BR>
The VAST majority of hackers are harmless, the groups reputation is sullied by the lunatic fringe that use their (not insignificant) programming abilites for personal gain or with malicious intent.
<BR>
As for that pile of steaming tripe about quake being a training ground for paramilitary, antisocial, crazed killers, anyone who stopped over-reacting long enough to actually look at the game (i have serious doubts as to whether the author HAS) woudl realise that, like most first person shooter games, it is incredibly unrealistic. Unless the author belives that it is possible to use a rocket launcher to propell yourself onto higher levels (ie third or higher storied buildings) or to indeed simply respwan (reappear healed and perfect somewhere else on the level) whenever you have been horribly killed. Let alone learn how to use things like plasma cannons and rail guns (both of which, if they exist at all, i doubt could be found in the household gun cabinet)<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So guide him don't cut him off...Your son will go farther with his computer knowledge and experience than you could ever go in your anti-technological life. If your son has a gift for the computer let him learn to use it. There are computer hackers out there that are legit...the only thing is they aren't called hackers when they get paid...they are security analysts, whom make more money in a year than you would probably make in 5. You're taking away tools from your kid that could make him successful in life. As for you list of things to watch for...take those down...your giving the wrong idea to parents who are dumb and uninformed like you...not one of those things was relevant. Let me go over your list: #1) I hate to break this to you, but your son is asking to switch from Aol because it sucks. It doesn't allow for a full internet experience. Most hackers have AOL accounts just to use them so they can't be traced or because it makes it harder to trace them. 2) Your son is learning about computers...let him experiment it teaches him about coding, protocols and other various useful internet technologies... 3)Everyone needs to upgrade...just because you deprive your kids to the point they have to beg to jump in to the next century...you shouldn't call it a sign of hacking *how lame* 4)Hacking Manuals, we already went over this, when he gets older and is being paid to keep hackers out as well as analyze networks for security weak points you won't be comlaining. Especially when he is paying you bill for your old folks home. 5) The more time he spends the more he learns. 6)Quake is just a game...allows to relax, get your mind off things, and enjoy all the computer has to offer. *Entertainment* 7) This is called growing up, don't blame it on the computer blame it on yourself. 8)Linux is the premier server operating system in the world. If he learns linux he's got a head start on most system administrators out there. 9)Again your son is growing up and your blaming it on the computer...this isn't a hacker style, sounds to me like it's a raver style so I assume your son is out having fun and not being to anti-social. 10)Again you have failed not your son, you have failed to provide proper motiviation to keep your son interested in academics and sports. Don't blame it on the computer it is your fault and no one elses.
<BR>

<BR>
In short, I wouldn't be worried about your son, seems to me you have more problems than he does. I would seek help for yourself and maybe an online course on computers preferably called "I'm an F**** moron, show me what computers is all about."<BR><BR></FONT></td>

----------------------------------------------

1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs?

This is no cause for alarm. Changing an ISP may simply mean 

shifting to another ISP which provides faster service, for 

example, broadband. Also, it may charge cheaper costs, 

which will benefit the less well-off families.

2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't 

remember installing?

This is also no cause for alarm. Not all software your 

child installs will be hacking software. At least some will 

definitely be good.

Also, I will like to correct you. Flash is definitely NOT a 

hacking software. Go ask someone who knows computers, some 

adult if necessary. Flash is a program used to create 

interactive multimedia pages for the internet. Flash 

requires a Flash Player, which is installed in 96% of all 

home computers, and comes with Microsoft Internet Explorer 

and Netscape Navigator as plug-ins. Please do not disgrace 

Flash by classifying it as a hacking software, which is 

extremely untrue.

Bonzi Buddy is NOT a hacking software as well. I can 

guarantee that. Comet Cursor is simply a program installed 

by unwaringly visiting some sites on the internet, and is 

also NOT a hacking software. Please do not classify before 

clearly checking up on your sources.

If you have further qualms that Flash IS a hacking 

software, I would suggest that you visit <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia's Website</a>.

3. Has your child asked for new hardware?

Computer hackers are limited by conventional hardware. That 

is true. However, your suggestion that they may require 

faster video/graphics card is absolutely ridiculous and of 

dubious origin. That is because graphics do NOT play a part 

in computer hacking, and is not necessary to the speed of 

hacking.

More memory would be still okay. If your computer is 

running sluggish, or he is a power computer user who knows 

computers well, he will definitely need it.

I would STRONLY like to rectify your unorthodox suggestion 

that AMD is a third-world-based company which makes 

inferior, knock-off copies of American processor chips. AMD 

is an internationally-recognised company which makes as 

good chips as Intel does, and for a much cheaper cost. It 

is in NO way an inferior company making inferior chips, as 

you so erraneously suggested.

They do NOT use child labour, and their production lines 

are of high-quality, under careful control. And in fact, 

AMD is also based in America. If you say that AMD is 

third-world-based company, then you are extremely wrong, 

for America is a first-world company, and I am extremely 

sure that you will agree with that.

Also, they do NOT delibrately disable features. They would 

not gain anything from that. They currently own a sizeable 

portion of the American processor market, and is, as I 

said, a famous processor-making company.

Also, I MUST stress that processors cannot control software 

hacking, at least not with current technology. Therefore, 

contrary to your suggestion - "...they deliberately disable 

the security features that American processor makers, such 

as Intel, use to prevent hacking..." - Intel does not make 

use of its processor to prevent hacking.

Why have you such a grudge against AMD? Do you even know 

what AMD stands for? Do you have completely no idea of the 

goodness of the processor chips AMD produces for your 

computer? If so, you must definitely visit 

http://www.amd.com/. In fact, they can sue you for saying 

that they employ child labour in their factories! What 

proof do you have?

4. Does your child read hacking manuals?

This is certainly something to worry about. However, 

proceed cautiously before doing anything. Your child may 

simply be studying the algorithm employed in programs, so 

as to gain some insight as to how programs are written, for 

educational purposes.

Your child may also be studying how he can make his own 

programs more secure. Therefore, as I said, proceed 

carefully.

5. How much time does your child spend using the computer 

each day?

If your child spends more than 30 minutes on the computer 

everyday, it is okay. If you need to type a ten-thousand 

word document, can you finish it in thirty minutes? I 

heavily doubt so. Therefore, always find out the reason 

before asking your child about why he is spending much time 

on the computer.

Also, he may be simply training himself in multimedia or 

programming, and that is for a good educational purpose. He 

can then participate in national and international 

competitions which will both earn him glory and experience. 

You will definitely be proud of your son then.

Put yourselves into your son's shoes. Can you even imagine 

what it will be like if you spend sixty minutes on the 

computer each day training algorithm and your mum says that 

you are hacking? Definitely not good.

Also, do you know what DOS stands for? In the world of 

hacking, it stands for Denial of Service.

6. Does your son use Quake?

For your information, Quake is a GAME. It is a first-person 

shooter, and most people will know that.

Also, for your information as well - "you should make hime 

understand that" - you spelled "him" wrongly. That's just 

for information.

7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his 

social behaviour?

I would like to comment that your son, most likely a 

teenage one, will have his own mood swings. Therefore, 

please do not disgrace the world of computing by publicly 

linking the entering of the world of computing to your 

child's surly moods. If your child's surly moods persist, I 

recommend that you consult a psychologist. I am sure that 

he will be able to help you solve your child's problems 

faster than banning him from computers.

8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?

Now this is something I would really like to comment about. 

FIRSTLY AND FOREMOSTLY, you spelled "Linux" WRONGLY as 

"Lunix". That is a grave spelling mistake, and it is a 

criticism to the world of Linux, the wonderful world of 

Linux.

Firstly, Linux is NOT an illegal hacking operating system. 

It is a PERFECTLY LEGAL open-source operating system, 

distributed freely under the GNU license. It is used mainly 

for hosting servers, and is an excellent alternative to 

Microsoft Windows(r). In fact, in some tasks it beats other 

operating systems outright.

Also, I would like to remind you that Linus is NOT a 

computer hacker. You even spelled his name wrongly! Also, 

he DID NOT CREATE Linux before the Russians lost the Cold 

War. Also, it is NOT based on a program called "xenix". As 

far as I am concerned and as far as I know, there is no 

such program.

Hackers DO NOT require these programs. They create their 

own programs.

Regarding what you said - "...using the "mp3" program." -, 

can you please specify what the "mp3" program is? I can 

list a few for you if you like. Napster, Microsoft Windows 

Media Player, RealPlayer, etc. So, when you post next time, 

please POST YOUR VIEWS CLEARLY and PLEASE do some research 

before posting.

Linus can sue you for calling him a notorious hacker, for 

public defamation. I also HEAVILY DISAGREE with what you 

said regarding telnet. I can see that you are a newbie to 

computers, and therefore, I, as an experienced player in 

the world of computing, would like to rectify you. Telnet 

is a program used to connect from machine to machine. It is 

NOT for connecting machines to the internet. Also, it DOES 


require a telephone. You probably have telnet on your 

computer youself. If you are using Microsoft Windows 95 or 

later, go to Start, Run, and type "telnet". Press enter. 

Telnet will then launch. So, if you are classifying telnet 

as a hacking program, I think that you would definitely 

ask, why is it bundled with Microsoft Windows in the first 

place as an accessory software?

ALso, if you want to uninstall Linux, you DO NOT send your computer back to the manufacturer. No experienced computer user does that. If you do, you are probably a newbie to the world of computing and has no right whatsoever to post stuff as if you are very experienced.

9. Has your son radically changed his appearance?

I agree totally with this.

10. Is your son struggling academically?

"This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry." - quoting your own words.

Firstly, if your child is a computer hacker, he will be EXTREMELY good at Math. His math will probably get himself ranked as first in class. That is because if you want to create programs, for hacking or NOT for hacking, you will need a good knowledge of algorithm. To learn algorithm properly, you will need good math skills.

"In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases."

The above is true, however.

------------------------------------------------

The above are purely my comments. They are accurate. Where I correct you, it is for your and your child's own good. DO NOT criticize AMD, as it can probably sue you for that.

I sincerely hope that you take my advice to you, stated above, as advice from a computer user much more experienced  than yourself. Also, as I said, if you are going to post anything here next time, please DO SOME RESEARCH first.

What are my own opinions on hacking? Hacking is highly immoral, and SHOULD NOT be practised at all. It is a skill to be ignored, to destroy.

And how do I know that some of what you said about hacking is false? That is because I am an experienced programmer and general computer user, and therefore certainly knows about all these. I am NOT a hacker. I do not hack.

Thank you for your time and attention. Also, in cases where I have corrected you for your spelling, it is for information only, and not meant to criticize.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

There are reasons why suicide exists. You should set an example by justifying the word. Remove yourself from the gene pool or help society by not having children. Please die the only idiot in your bloodline instead of putting into this world other chances of having someone like you. If you have any, drag them in your liberating of society.

<BR>

<BR>
Btw ms-dos 6.22 is still the most stable operating system that MS has created...and the fastest too :)
<BR>

<BR>
Actually linux, windows 2000, nt, xp, os2, mac-os and unixes are all (D)OSes (as it stands for (Disk) Operating System). But not windows 95, 98, 98Se or ME because they are all run under ms-dos (which therefore must be loaded before loading windows) and makes them unstable due to limitations of ms-dos.
<BR>

<BR>
a hint: use 4DOS...faster smoother better ;)

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Sir I don't know you from a hill of beans, but I can see you are most ignorant about this subject.. Let's take your comments and break them down one by one shall we?
<BR>

<BR>
"1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL. These providers have a strict "No Hacking" policy, and take careful measures to ensure that your internet experience is enjoyable, educational and above all legal. If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content. It is best to stick with the protection AOL provides, rather than using a home-based solution. If your son is becoming a hacker, he will be able to circumvent any home-based measures with surprising ease, using information gleaned from various hacker sites. "
<BR>

<BR>
This is an extremist statement if I ever heard one. AOL is not a real "ISP" and if you think there is no hacking going on within AOL then you are sorely mistaken. Even within AOL there are hackers who would steal others accounts and use them for their own pourposes. No ISP is safe.. Not even AOL.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel. Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". "
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is a program that allows you to change your cursor, nothing more. Bonzi Buddy is a cute little desktop toy, nothing more. And Flash is nothing more than a interactive movie player. End of story.
<BR>

<BR>
"The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding." 
<BR>

<BR>
If you confront your child with this, he/she will most likely laugh at you.. And honestly I don't blame him/her.
<BR>

<BR>
"3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. "
<BR>

<BR>
Obviously yet again you show your ignorance. AMD is sold in many systems, even the Compaq's you most revere. Also is is sold in many shops around town. It is quickly becoming a standard in PC computing, not because hackers use it, but because it is far more superior to Intel chips and about half the price. 
<BR>

<BR>
"4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds. 
<BR>

<BR>
There are, unfortunately, many hacking manuals available in bookshops today. A few titles to be on the lookout for are: "Snow Crash" and "Cryptonomicon" by Neal Stephenson; "Neuromancer" by William Gibson; "Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly; "Geeks" by Jon Katz; "The Hacker Crackdown" by Bruce Sterling; "Microserfs" by Douglas Coupland; "Hackers" by Steven Levy; and "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric S. Raymond. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you find any of these hacking manuals in your child's possession, confiscate them immediately. You should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves. You may meet with some resistance at first, but even booksellers have to bow to community pressure. "
<BR>

<BR>
And Harry Potter will teach your child to become a master of the Occult and summon demons to devour your soul.
<BR>

<BR>
"5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day." 
<BR>

<BR>
Sorry  little Johnny, I know you are working on that project for school, but your 30 mins are up. We don't want you to become a hacker, do we?
<BR>

<BR>
"6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is using Quake, you should make hime understand that this is not acceptable to you. You should ensure all the firearms in your house are carefully locked away, and have trigger locks installed. You should also bring your concerns to the attention of his school. "
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an old game that most kids don't even know exist. If your son is playing it, the most likely reason is that your computer is too old to play any new game. It is far from virtual reality, about as far as your connection to the real world is. Please give this child an AMD processor for Christmas, and while yer at it get him a New video card.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
Even when confronted, your son will probably find it difficult to talk about this problem to you. He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things. He may tell you that it is you who has the problem, and you should "back off" and "stop smothering him." Do not allow yourself to be deceived. You are the only chance your son has, even if he doesn't understand the situation he is in. Keep trying to get through to him, no matter how much he retreats into himself. "
<BR>

<BR>
The most likely reason for this is that his father has so lost touch with the real world that he has been driven to the point of near insanity by his Father's extreme stupidity.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface. "
<BR>

<BR>
I won't even acknowlage this one with a reply. Suffice to say, why don't you read a little?
<BR>

<BR>
"9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) There are many such hackers in schools today, and your son may have started to associate with them. If you notice that your son's group of friends includes people dressed like this, it is time to think about a severe curfew, to protect him from dangerous influences. "
<BR>

<BR>
I'd say he's in a gang.. Better check under his bed for a gun.. Or maybe some books of the occult. Has he read Harry Potter?
<BR>

<BR>
"10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases. Also, the reduction in exercise may cause him to lose muscle mass, and even to start gaining weight. For the sake of your child's mental and physical health, you must put a stop to his hacking, and limit his computer time drastically. "
<BR>

<BR>
You limited his computer time so he can't finish his school work.. 'nuff said.
<BR>

<BR>
"I encourage all parents to read through this guide carefully. Your child's future may depend upon it. Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison, and tear your family apart. It cannot be taken too seriously. "
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Let's hope this was a joke. Or more to the point, let's hope those who read your site do not share your brain. 
<BR>

Just to give you a little background on myself, I am a Network Engineer for a consulting company in Toledo, Ohio. A proud father of 1, with a loving wife and a Golden Retriever. I'm 28 years old and have been working with computers since I first laid my hands on one at age 13.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">hmmm... so you found a hacker? I just finished reading your top 10 sign list,and it must be a joke,it sounds more like your trying to get people to use WIN95 with AOL, and hate Quake, so i'm going to go through the "anti-hacker" page, and point out the many mistakes, and don't expect me to use proper grammer and to correct every typo, because i don't feel like spending much time on this: (notice i didn't qoute sentenses and such,don't feel like it,wont anytime soon,you should have enough common sense to tell what parts i talk about)
<BR>

<BR>
Enlightened, modern parent...? your top 10 list makes you look like a parinoid parent, by the way, why is it you put links on at least 1 word per at most 5 sentenses? you think someone wouldn't know what parent means? oh well,not like i'm going to click on them anyways,don't feel like loading 10434 (yes,i just picked a random #, shut up about it because i'm not going to bother counting all of them) different pages.
<BR>

<BR>
you mentioned somewhere on your top10 that the get more aggresive, well, TV shows are full of violence, MAYBE thier just getting violent from the shows they watch? and NOT because thier a hacker...
<BR>

<BR>
Compaq, yes, thier good computers, but let me point out it's not the computer itself you learn with,but the software...
<BR>

<BR>
sounds like Peter liked the computer a lot...
<BR>

<BR>
Cindy says he's a hacker? without evidence that means nothing to me, there are so many possiblities of what happened in which Peter isn't relly a hacker, here's a few examples:
<BR>
1.he can be a hacker-wannabe
<BR>
2.he was joking
<BR>
3.he wanted cindy away so said that so she would get scared away or something
<BR>
4.he didn't understand what "hacker" ment,he probebly thought it ment 'a good player' or something
<BR>

<BR>
you amazed? the first thoughts that would come to my mind was "sure,whatever"(sarcasm in the qoutes...), so obviously i wouldn't relly belive it.
<BR>

<BR>
didn't you say you raised them to be HONEST later...?
<BR>

<BR>
hmmm... evidence,tell me some evidence that DOES mean he's a hacker
<BR>

<BR>
i'm sure you've been disappointed in them before
<BR>

<BR>
and they obviously aren't the most honest, must i quote the part where you say Cindy tells storys?
<BR>

<BR>
denials, maybe that would be telling the truth instead, because your evidence is crap, and you probebly asked people on the street for research, your probebly also not letting him tell his side of the story
<BR>

<BR>
ok,here's 2 ways to help others:
<BR>
1. scince you went ahead and "helped" with hacking, so why don't you flame computer users in general,so i can flame you on that
<BR>
2.until your completely sure your not stupid and that you got good evidence,don't put up the hel
<BR>
3.if your probebly going to keep up with this BS whenever you say something,maybe you should just STFU
<BR>

<BR>
oh god,you published it?! you will be so dead if i see it in the stores, you have completely inaccurate signs, and if other people start reading this and believing it,thier going to go parinoid like you
<BR>

<BR>
matches profile...dumbass, what if he IS a hacker yet doesn't even show one sign? then it's not very good signs,and with inaccuracys your probebly going to catch the everyday kid and call him a hacker or something
<BR>

<BR>
misbehaviour? your a paranoid parent, you shouldn't tell others what's misbehaviour and whats not, because your going to probebly look at something completely ok and go yelling at people for exepting that as ok
<BR>

<BR>
not everyone's on the internet for education, people have different reasons,i just browse forums and play games,you on the other hand go flame people saying complete BS
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
10.i've seen quite a few people struggling academically, but i know that thier not hackers, i just have one simple thing to say:
<BR>
just because your son struggling academically, doesn't mean that your son is a hacker. It's not a sign of hacking, it's a sign of not spending enough time on school work
<BR>
9.No, it means that he's just trying to be "cool", I've seen plenty of people doing that crap, yet they know NOTHING about computers!
<BR>
8.don't know what Lunix is, so i won't comment on this one
<BR>
7.Maybe something to do with spending too much time on the computer,maybe not...
<BR>
6.no dumbass,Quake is a game,there are 5 Quake games i have heard of,note that i say GAME,not hacking software:GAMES,let me spell it out: G A M E S, understand? probebly wouldn't with such a low IQ
<BR>

<BR>
hmm... if thier causing erratic behaviour,then they don't shouldn't play games,they simply can't tell whats ok in real life and what's not ok
<BR>

<BR>
hmmm...if he's learning,then you have nothing to worry about,he's going to look for a CTRL key on his keyboard
<BR>
5. 30min isn't much,DOS is not a hacking program,it's automaticly installed with WIN95 and 98,and is required for WIN 3.1 (very old OS)
<BR>
but yes,it might be used in a nagitive way,but then again,everything can be used like that
<BR>

<BR>
45 min is very short too,i can't enjoy a few good games of UT in 45 min!
<BR>
4.true,likely he is being a hacker,but he might be trying to use the "hacking knowladge" to prevent himself from being hacked,and some of those manuals might not even be hacking tutorials
<BR>
3.LOL!!! YOUR A COMPLETE DUMBASS!
<BR>
new hardware is NOT a sign of hacking,you ARE parinoid, new hardware means your computer is old,i'm going to laugh at you and your old 56k in a old pentium 2,*laughs at pitifull parent*
<BR>
2.Bonzi buddy:it's not good,but it's not hacker software,it's spyware,big differense
<BR>
Comet Cursor:i remeber this on my brother's computer,but he's not a hacker,it changes your cursor,no other effects...
<BR>
Flash:your kidding me,right? no?! your stupid, flash is not hacker software,i shouldn't even have to comment on this...
<BR>
btw:some of this software might end up getting installed without even HIS knowladge,as it sometimes comes with other programs
<BR>
1.lol,AOL sucks,my friend uses it,it's not very good,he might be trying to get around it,but then again,he must just hate it,and with what he knows,he could have just simply gotten rid of the protection with his hacking abilities
<BR>

<BR>
now to comment on other parts of this site:
<BR>
-poll:just because thier a hacker doesn't mean... ...they hack into NASA ...they are thieves. ...they-wtf is sociopaths??? well anyways: ...they use illegal drugs ...thier helping osama (does he even have intenet in that cave of his???) ...they are as american as anyone else ....no,that's people obsessed with computers in general
<BR>

<BR>
-related links:wtf is this?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
btw:if this post is deleted,and i ever come back to flame you,i will repost it,i will bookmark this site under "spam these sites",and copy these flames into a TXT document<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
2. I install new programs all the time. No other of my family would know, mainly because they don't use the computer. They usually have something to do with chats, games, or media. Not hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
3. I've need more memory right now. Not because I hack, but because my computer freezes when I connect using a DSL modem.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Yeah... that probobly is a good indicator. The only alternative for reading hacking books is to prevent being hacked. But some of the books listed are not strictly hacking sources.
<BR>

<BR>
5. Thirty minutes? It takes me that long to check my mail! I'm on for hours, usually browsing MB's.
<BR>

<BR>
6. Overgeneralization. Quake is a game. I know hackers that play it, but that doesn't mean all Quake players are hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
7. Ahem. That's called puberty.  And hacking is not the only computer-related activity that causes withdrawal from the real world. MB's, RPG's, etc. are sufficient to that effect.
<BR>

<BR>
8. What a moron! Lunix?! Do you mean Linux? It's not solely for hackers. Programmers often prefer this. Hacking takes some programming knowlede, though. Another overgeneralization. While all hackers have to have programming knowlede, not all programmers are hackers. If they were, we'd all have some really fucked up computers now, wouldn't we?
<BR>

9. WTF? What does clothing have to do with this? That description sounds more like a clubber. And if he wants to get into that, he's totally wrong. Most hackers I know go for blacks and greys.

P.S. aol is a rotten os and how much did intel pay you to write about amd like that. I think they could sue you for saying that stuff about them.PLEASE EXCUSE MY SPELLING AND GRAMMAR IM RUSHING THIS OUT THANK YOU

<BR>
I don't know how I could get anything done withough telnet and linux.  I don't want to scare anyone but click on your start button and select run.  Type in telnet.  See what happenes.  telnet is on every windows machine.  
<BR>

<BR>
I guess I'm a hacker cause I use telnet and linux for school work.  I also spend way more than 30 min on the computer per day.    
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe you son wants to change ISP's cause AOL sucks.  
<BR>

<BR>
Does your child read hacking manuals.  Thats only number 4.  I guess if you got punched in the face you might think that someone was angry with you but there could be 3 other, better reasons why it happened.
<BR>

<BR>
I guess if they want a new processor because the computer is slow their game dont run as fast maybe?  And AMD, which can be bought in stores, tend to be cheaper than an Intel. 
<BR>

<BR>
Anyways, whoever wrote this, if your serious calm down, if not, thanks for the laugh.

<BR>

<BR>
Now to get to some of the things you have discussed.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is not some kind of hacking processor and surely they are not an "american Knockoff" as AMD makes the best processors for the money. I don't see how you can sit there and say that Intel processors "Stop" or "Prohibit" hacking. I would love to see where you got that info. Also go to any best buy or compusa and you will more then likely be allowed to buy an AMD processor. 
<BR>

<BR>
Linux... was made 10 years ago by a Finnish Graduate Student named: Linux Torvalds. It is a Unix-like operating system made for the INTEL 80386 processor platform (by reading these facts about hacking i would assume that intel is the hackers platform of choice) Today linux runs on everything from very small mobile devices( palm pads, cellphones, etc) and embeded devices to mainframes. also Linux is in no way illegal. Marijuana is illegal and that is why you do not see it sold on store shelves. 
<BR>

<BR>
PERL-is not just used for hacking it is widely used in the making of webpages and system administration, what about Python? and also what about Java? LISP? C? C++? hell all programming panguages are used to hack with and they are also used for other things like writing software to make your computer more useful to you. (you would deny your own son doing something as productive as that?)  
<BR>

<BR>
Quake: ok so i myself don't like the game, but how can you sit there and say that it is the meeting ground of hackers? when do they hack while they are chasing each other around and clicking the mouse button to shoot their cannons? I have in fact palyed this game and it is nothing like shooting my .40 cal handgun....you cannot say that these kids are learning how to aim and shoot a "real" gun. ok so maybe some games influence violence in teens, but we were all in the rebellious stage once. like was said above it is your responsibility to raise your kid. Yes i have a little girl, and no i will probably not want any guy to touch her, but at 17 i figure she will be able to start making her own choices in preparing her for her adult life. 
<BR>

<BR>
That is all i can think of to say. You really need to research "Hacking" try a search and type "how to hack" and go look at the Hacking FAQ...then you will maybe understand some of the elements of what hacking is about... as far as now you know nothing and will probably never know anything about this thing you call "hacking" 
<BR>
 I strongly agree with everyone here that you are an Idiot. you should go get yourself some books and read about the inner workings of hacking. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

He hack into the FBI? or did you find him looking up Pr0n? And by the way Mr. pussyman, who made you the figurehead on hacking anyway?
<BR>

<BR>
here's the facts:
<BR>
AOL sucks, AMD is better than Intel, Faster video cards are good, Linux is more stable that windows, The guy who wrote this gets it in the A-hole daily, he shaves his legs, and does not know a thing about hacking! Think everyone who wrote in the forums is saying the same thing.
<BR>

<BR>
I work in the IT field: and as a professional,&lt;ul&gt; My advice is to totally protect your computer from hackers because it sounds like you don't have a clue. there is an easy way to do this too:
<BR>
Open up file and print sharing in your Network Properties! this will protect for anyone invading your computer.&lt;/ul&gt; this is what a firewall does anyway, but it's not as pesky as a firewall. No needs to do "accepts" and "declines". just easy internet access.
<BR>

<BR>
I would plea for anyone who does not know Computers verywell to open up this File and Printer sharing. I do not know why it was not put on in the first place, anyone could be in your computer right now!

<BR>
seriously this person is a crack pot of serious preportions...
<BR>

<BR>
he says "Has your son asked you to change ISPs?"
<BR>
did it occure to you that AOL is the most positivly crappy ISP in existance? try IE or netscape... you realize that net nannys like the one built into AOL will not let you go to a cooking web-site that tells you how to prepare chiken breast simply because of the word breast, yet you could get into a porn site based on pictures of fat women in naughty positions under the title Titanic, they also ban videogame websites, such a stupid way of doing things...
<BR>

<BR>
"Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?" perhaps he installed a graphics editing program... der.. check what was installed without your knowledge before screaming bloody murder eh?
<BR>

<BR>
"3. Has your child asked for new hardware?" maybe he just wants a computer that keeps up with the times. good god, paranoid enough?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"4. Does your child read hacking manuals?" good question.. too bad the books you listed don't really do much in the way of being hackers mauels. they're perfectly respectable books for the most part. again: paranoid enough?
<BR>

<BR>
"5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?" this has nothing to do with it. maybe they simply enjoy using the comuter, has that occured to your closed minded little self?
<BR>

<BR>
"6. Does your son use Quake?" jezzus fucking christ, what kind of idiot are you? Quake is a videogame about blowing stuff up. guns yes. hacker hub, no
<BR>

<BR>
"8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?" Laugh out loud, can you say "paranoid"? ... that's all I have to say on this topic...
<BR>

<BR>
"9. Has your son radically changed his appearance?" retard, fucking retard. people dress this way because they are disterbed and need counceling... and listen to bad music... but it certainly has nothing to do with being a hacker...
<BR>

<BR>
"10. Is your son struggling academically?"
<BR>
hackers are more ingenuitive than the average person, they should have higher grades... maybe if your child's grades are falling, it's just cuz you have a stupid kid?"
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
you are a dumb idiot... you don't deserve to have a computer... now shut up and quit spreading this kind of crap. it's all lies. you are such a moron. get a life and quit trying to ruin the life of children by making the internet a cild unfriendly place.

- William Gibson - a great writer of Science-Fiction and - if I'm right - the writer of the first cyberpunk novel.<br>
- The people who wrote the great book "Programming with Perl" - ah, and if you idiots (sorry, just couldn't hold off my anger anymore) don't know what <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a> is, you should know that it is a grea programming language that your kids (beware!!!) learn in university, and that it was created by a NASA computer engineer and it helped *your* shuttles get where they got! As a matter of fact I think that Perl powers this site too >:(<br>
- The great people at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft Corporation</a>, who weren't told that their 16bit operating system MS-DOS (Disk Operating System, as opposed to Denial of Service) - which by the way has no network, not to speak of Internet, connection built-in - can be used to 'access' 'shells' on remote computers<br>
- The living legends at <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com">id Software</a>, especially John Carmack (who, by the way, is my idol) - for assuming that the revolutionary computer game <a href="http://www.quakeworld.com">Quake</a> is a) a virtual reality program b) a hackers' only hang-out place c) a thing that trains you in using firearms d) responsible for the killings in your schools (and as someone already stated - blaming a computer software is easy, just don't blame yourself, right?)<br>
- My other idol, Linus Torwalds (who is Finnish, just for the record), for accusing him of creating a 'hacking' operating system (probably our friend has *absolutely no idea* what 'hacker' really means, but we'll get to that), and for sayng that <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> (not <a href="http://www.lunix.org">Lunix</a>, which is an operating system that works on your PDAs and Mobile Phones) is illegal.<br>
- The people at AT & T Bell Labs, for confusing the UNIX operating system with something called 'xenix', and for stating that Microsoft built it (heh, Microsoft didn't even exist back then =)<br>
- The creators of the MPEG Layer-3 (MP3 for short) audio compressing codec. MP3 is a codec, a standard, not a tool. It is used to compress music files. C'mon ppl, I tought you were a little more than monkeys in the computer age....<br>
- The whole Unix/Linux/*NIX Community, for stating that they are computer hackers... lol<br>
- The creators of the Telnet network protocol<br>
- The makers of LILO (The <b>LI</b>nux <b>LO</b>ader) which is a boot-manager (why do I bother?), apiece of software that enables your computer to hold more than one operating system and switch between the installed OS'es just by restarting your computer. He stated that LILO destroys your hard-drive... like EuroNews says, 'No Comment'... ofcourse it's totally wrong!<br>
- The whole Hip-Hop community for stating that they are 'computer hackers' - judging by appearance or music preferences is shallow, don't you think? Not to speak about discrimination.
<br><br>
I feel sorry for him, but i feel most sorry for his son, who has a parent who defenately wouldn't listen to him - I mean, if he actually wanted to use Linux, he knew what he was doing, and he could have explained his dad - if he just listened....
<br><br>
By the way, using computers for more than an hour in a row means that you probably a) started programming b) are playing a very neat computer game like Quake 1/2/3 c) listening to music d) dunno, making websites with Flash?
<br><br>
As for the term Hacker. Well most people here seem to not know what it means, so I'll just copy a <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~pmaydell/hacker.html">definition</a>:

<blockquote>
hacker /n./<br>
[originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] 
<br><br>
1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 
<br><br>
2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 
<br><br>
3. A person capable of appreciating hack value. 
<br><br>
4. A person who is good at programming quickly. 
<br><br>
5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in "a Unix hacker". 
<br><br>
(Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) 
<br><br>
6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example. 
<br><br>
7. One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations. 
<br><br>
8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence "password hacker", "network hacker". The correct term for this sense is cracker. <br><br>
</blockquote>

As you see, the term 'hacker' as <b>you</b> know it has changed drastically. Wake up, people!
<br><br>
It makes me sick to read this as a person who actually knows what our friend is talking about (as opposed to him, who - as I have already stated - has no idea). I'm a perfectly normal 16yr. old boy, I prepare for Computer the Science national contests in my country ( in fact, I got the 3rd degree last year) and for that I spend 2-3 hours a day on the computer, from which 1 hr. is on the Internet. I use Linux in my training process because, frankly, it's a darn good OS for programming. But even so, I have a girlfriend, I love going out with friend to see a movie or for a walk in the park and I practice jogging and judo. I read lots of sci-fi books, and I not challanged at school with any subject. Judging by the fact that I created a lot of tweaking software for my own (and the whole world's) use - like an ID3 tag extractor - and that I modified some of the Linux sources you can say that I am a 'hacker'. Add to that the fact that I use SSH and Telnet to connect to my highschool's webserver and read my mail, that I have Flash installed on my hard-drive (next to the infamous illegal OS called 'Linux'), that I listen to MP3s and you can say that I am a social disease, right? <b>NOT!</b>

   comet curser is just a program that gives you new arrows for your computer. Can you tell me how that has anything to do with hacking????
<BR>
   AMD procesers is a processer just like pentium and comes with all Compaq computers. And If your son asks for a new video card or hard drive there is no way it would have anything to do with hacking. If anything it has to do with video games.
<BR>
   Linux (not lunix)is not mde by some soviet guy. It is just another operating system the reqiures a whole lot of typing. Not hacking asshole!!!!!!
<BR>
   Finally, Quake is a fucking video game. It has nothing what so ever to do with hacking. What bullshit did you look up to find this crap.
<BR>
   So after reading this how the fuck can you think that your son is a hacker. If you were my dad i'd knock your teeth out for even thinking it. How can you have thought those programs had to do with hacking. Its ridiculous. That just shows how mmcuh you know about computers MORON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Okay. Let's start at the top.  Upon reading this article, I was laughing constantly, and nearly fell of my chair on several occasions.  I was finding it hard to believe that this wasn't a total joke, and I was in a dream.. or something.  
<BR>

<BR>
Error #1: Changing ISPs.  Perhaps your son wanted some more download credit so he could grab a few shareware programs? AOL Has a very Non-Lenient download policy. 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #2: All Isps monitor suspicious behaviour, and are required by law to submit any logs and information of illegalities. 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #3: 'Hacker Software'. Look mate, I don't know if you've ever seen Bonzi.com or not, but it's a cute little gorilla that lives on your desktop, and tells you jokes occasionally.  Perhaps your son just wanted a friend? As for the other programs, GET REAL! Try things like SecureCRT(most people use it for legal connections anyway..) NetBus, Backorifice, Sub7(we're talking windows boxes here) And a great number of other lame 'hacker' programs.
<BR>

<BR>
Error #4: Hardware. I Run an AMD, and I sure hope AMD sues the shit through you for that accusation.  AMD Is a legitimate country, and sells quality merchandise. Hacking bars are bullshit, there's no way to actually stop 'hacking' (apart from denying packets, which would demote any internet experience you could wish to have) 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #5: DOS has NOTHING to do with taking control, DOS(Denial Of Service) is simply taking UP all incoming bandwidth, therefore slowing down connections, and it can result in dropping them out.  However, taking down a .com, (usually hosted on a T1 or above) is A _LITTLE_ bit HARD with AOL(56k/s). T1s are 1.5mbps, y'know, 1500k/s? Do your math. 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #6: Quake. Quake2 is the game that's played, and it's a bit hard to 'chat' while you're trying to rail someone, at least in my experience. Quake is a culture, and yes, some hackers reside on the servers, but it's a harmless stress relief. Much better than hacking your hoster and defacing your website.. don't you think? 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #7: Reffer to Error #3 - your son is reaching out. Fool, take his hand. 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #8: Okay, umm.. where to start. 
<BR>
It's spelt Linux, for one, and your website is no doubt hosted via a unix or linux clone, the ones you mentioned.  Linux and unix are the preffered operating systems for all majour companies, because of the stability and flexibility.  Telnet was *NOT* developed by Linus, and he isn't a soviet. Fool. The russians didn't develop unix, it was scripted by some hackers in a university in the states somewhere, and no. Some families use user friendly unix clones for their operating system, because the adults in the house (ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING).  Unix is a versatile, stable, and customizeable environment.  No doubt your son wanted to expand his horizons, and see what he's capable of doing! It could pay your damn retirement fund.
<BR>
- Oh, by the way, the mp3 program you're reffering to is xmms, and you don't steal mp3s from it, they're stored on your hard drive. Who would want to steal mp3s when he can just download them from an underground 'hacker' network? *wink* 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #9: Appearance. See Error #3. 
<BR>

<BR>
Error #10: Otaku develops a lot of security patches, to save the asses of many vulnerable people. You should be gratefull. As for hacker networks at a local school? dream on.  
<BR>

<BR>
Error #11: Do your DAMN RESEARCH BEFORE MAKING A TOTAL FOOL OF YOURSELF! How old are you? I'm 14.

LINUX is another operative system and it's very familiar with WINDOWS. And let me ask:  HOW DO YOU GET MUSIC FROM A STEREO WITHOUT HAVING THE STEREO ATTACHED TO THE INTERNET!??!??!?

The comments on this article are probably more hilarious then the satire itself was ever thought out to be..

So it strikes me - Some of these hate-comments must be fake. I admit, I'm north-european, and don't know americans that much.. But get real.. You're not THAT stupid, are you?

No wonder you have a monkey boy for president and keep bombing your own soldiers down in Afghanistan then..

<BR>

<BR>
I am a mother of three boys and I am new to the internet.  I do not like all the profanity in this program, but the article scared me and I think my son may be a "hacker".  He does not want to use the windows operation like they use at school and he yells at me when I come into his room while he is on the computer.  Sometimes when I am using the computer the screen just goes blank and all these colors start moving around.  I know this is probably a "computer virus".
<BR>

<BR>
The other day when I logged on to my email there were nasty messages from some girls I didn't even know he was "dating".
<BR>

<BR>
Can someone please give me some information about counselors for him?  I need to do something before it's too late and he gets arrested for being a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
Thank you<BR><BR></FONT></td>

If you don't let him do what he needs to do, it'll just get worse. Leave the kid alone. You'll do more harm than good if you butt in. As for the profanity, he's gonna get exposed to it at some point in his life anyway, so don't worry about it. It's part of growing up. So stop hindering them and let your kids be themselves!

Anyway, the reason your son wants an AMD CPU is because Intel create overpriced, underpowred CPU's that arent as well suited to games and such as AMD cpu's.

If you have something to say against hackers, or the general virtues of them, fine, but don't try and make every damn kid on the face of the Earth look like a hacker just because you think everyone is "the devil". I only have two words for you, screw you! You need to wake up and realize, and have more theoretically thought up information supported by real facts. So what, I want a faster computer. Whoopty fucking do. So I want a faster video card, maybe it's to play Quake. ;-) haha. Go out and go attend some more of your kids teenage parties, and help embarrass him to the point he hates his life. Then you'll see who should be watching who.

<BR>

<BR>
In response to:
<BR>

<BR>
1):  The ISP has no effect on the ability of anyone to "hack".  All surfing of the internet is done through a browser, and hackers simply don't need to use them.  As I'm sure most of you know, you can log on to the internet without opening a browser (in Windows, simply click START&gt;SETTINGS&gt;NETWORK ABD DIAL-UP CONNECTIONS).  Once you are logged on to your ISP, you can run programs and distribute them with third-party software.  
<BR>

<BR>
2):  Checking for "hacker" software is advisable, but do some research on the actual software before judging.  Bonzai Buddy is an internet connection optimizer that purportedly makes downloads go faster.
<BR>

<BR>
3):  Hardware has nothing to do with hacking ability.  More powerful hardware simply makes the computer run faster and more efficiently.  As an aside, AMD is a highly respected CPU maker that is of a quality comparable to Pentiums.  The CPU has absolutely nothing to do with any software of any kind.  (Except perhaps to help to run faster through faster chip speeds)  btw, I bought a CompaQ with an AMD processor installed!
<BR>

<BR>
4):  Absolutely, and responsible parent should know their children's reading and entertainment habits as a matter of course.
<BR>

<BR>
5):  DOS is simply a Disk Operating System that has been around since the 80's.  In and of itself, it can damage nothing.  To hack, you would have to run a program (application) in DOS, similar to runng any program in Windows.
<BR>

<BR>
6):  Quake is simply a computer game that has absolutely nothing to do with hacking either.
<BR>

<BR>
7):  Again, absolutely.  Any change in behavior is a cause for concern.
<BR>

<BR>
8):  Spelled LINUX.  Again, a respected Operating System.  Not nearly as widely used as Windows, but then again, neither is Mac.  Linux was created as competition for Windows, and is available for download FREE from several different sources.  There are many hardware and software manufacturers that support Linux, and their number is growing, although it probably will never be anywhere near as popular as Windows.  It is constantly being improved by private citizens.  It is very good for people who are interested in programming to practice their skills in a real-world environment.
<BR>

<BR>
9):  See response to 7.
<BR>

<BR>
10):  There is no danger from radiation from a computer, you can search and find any number of studies to confirm that.  The worst danger is eyestrain and carpal tunnel.  Eyestrain is caused by looking at bright flickering images for long periods of time, and carpal tunnel is caused by repetitive hand motions.  Anyone who isn't sufficiently active will develop health problems, limiting their computer time is certainly a good idea, but not for the reasons listed in the article above.
<BR>

<BR>
Conclusion:  This article is full of misleading, inaccurate information.  I would suggest before you accept the above article, check around with respected computer professionals such as Best Buy, CompUSA, and so forth.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Linux is NOT an illegal OS that was created by a "hacker". A hacker is someone who tries to better the internet by finding holes in a system and then posting it so that the problem can be fixed. What you have in mind is a "cracker" who will break into a system and destroy the contents on the inside.  It is obvious that if you really are a parent that you must live in the middle of nowhere and have absolutely no idea how computers work, or what any programs do.  Flash is a program that allows you to see things on the web, comet cursor is a program that can be used to change how your mouse cursor works.  Also, aparantly you are also deprived of any form of news because AMD (American Micro Devices) is NOT a company based in a third world country that uses child labor.  You CANNOT use child labor in the process of making computer porcessors. You have to be inside a controlled Fab in order to make them.  Also, AMD is by far better than Intel is at this point in time.  I seriously doubt that you are a realy parent, and if you are... I can only say this: YOU ARE A FUCKING THIRD WORLD MORON OR REDNECK THAT IS FULL OF SHIT AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL HE IS TALKING ABOUT YOU CHILDEN WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE EPITEMY OF REBELLIOUS IDIOTS AND LOSERS THAT WILL BE SEVERLY LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN DO.  THEY WILL NEVER SUCCEED IN SOCIETY AND WILL TURN OUT LIKE THE FUCKING MORON THAT YOU ARE.  BTW: DON'T WRITE ARTICLES ON ANY TOPIC UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE RESEARCHED THE TOPIC YOU FUCKING IDIOT<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Many things you say are just plain wrong and it makes me (and every other enlightened person) want to throw a brick at you.  First off, Comet Cursor cannot be catagorized as "hacker software" on any level unless making your cursor vanish periodically on your own computer.  Oh no, that is surely the work of a talented hacker... or the work of a 9 year old that hates his father.

When I read that Quake was a meeting place for hackers I stopped and called up my friends to read you article.  We all had a good laugh about that one.  Quake is a game!  A game, not an evil meeting place where people talk about hacking.  You'll find that people that talk about hacking usually don't know shit about it.

<BR>

<BR>
When your daughter said your son was an hacker, maybe she didn't mean a computer pirate but a true hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
An hacker is not someone who will break into someone else's PC, that's being a computer pirate. A cracker is nothing of that as well, it's simply someone who knows how to make game cracks, or in other words: He's able to play games without the original CD. The true defenition of being a hacker is someone who is interested in computers, technology, medias or anything related to those three. Maybe your daughter meant it that way.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and a final word. AOL is -NOT- and absolutely -NOT- a good ISP. Here's a common conversation between two teens in AOL chats:
<BR>

<BR>
Teen1: hi how R U? ASL?
<BR>
Teen2: 13/G/Texas City
<BR>
Teen1: kool U wanna cybersex0r!!!?!!!1
<BR>

<BR>
So going on @home is not a bad idea, but rather saving your family from the really evil influence that AOL gives -_-
<BR>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Much of the information presented in your article is incorrect; although parents should watch for dangerous behaviour in their children most of the warning signs indicated in this article are not cause for alarm.
<BR>

<BR>
Your child may want another ISP because your ISP is not sufficient for his needs. AOL is slow and can make researching tedious at best. Research all ISP's before choosing them, but look into your child's requests. If your child is requesting MSN or AOL, however, you may wish to simply point them to the respective instant messenger, since neither of these ISP's is worth using.
<BR>

<BR>
"Comet Cursor" is a browser plug-in, but it has no hacking capabilities. It is used by some sites to allow the cursor to change to site themed cursors, instead of the default cursors. The children have no control over which sites ask to install the plug-in. It presents no danger and is even used by the official "Dilbert" site, or at least was.
<BR>

<BR>
"Flash" is a browser plug-in, that again presents little danger. It allows the browser to view vector graphics and movies in the SWF format, but again will not turn your child into a hacker - the worst they can do is use it to play an offensive movie. It's used by more legitimate sites than dangerous ones, however, so I recommend simply monitoring your child's browser history.
<BR>

<BR>
"Bonzi Buddy" is useless, but presents no threat regardless.
<BR>

<BR>
A faster video card will not assist your child in hacking, nor will a larger hard drive. The only threat a larger hard drive poses is the ability to store more information - allow them the larger hard drive if you have the budget, but monitor its contents and confront them if you find large amounts of encrypted or password protected information. Small amounts might simply be a diary and are probably no cause for concern.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD does not use child labor, and are perfectly safe. They are indeed sold in stores, ask any Best Buy, Circuit City, or other trustworthy computer store employee about them.
<BR>

<BR>
Programming with Perl is a legitimate book. It assists your child in writing safe programs that can help people. Most computer books are of the same variety. It is a valuable skill to be able to write computer programs, just watch if your child is doing test runs to ensure that there is no danger.
<BR>

<BR>
Lunix is a mispelling of Linux, the operating system created by Linus Torvalds ~1991, and is legitimate operating system. There are ways to safely remove it without returning your PC to its manufacturer, and it presents no real danger. It is an alternative to Windows, but doesn't have to replace it, and can run alongside it.
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is not a hacker playground, it is a violent online game. Still to be monitored, but not in the method specified.
<BR>

<BR>
Last, but not least, there is a signifigant terminology error in this document. The term "hacker" was used in place of "cracker". Hackers pose no threats, they are programmers that if anything are friendly and want to help people. Crackers are hackers gone bad, they use their programming skills to pursue illegal goals.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So by saying that AMD is an evil company that copies (how retarded) American technology and uses sweatshops you are also saying that the glorious computer manufacturer you use also supports such insidious practices.  
<BR>

<BR>
By the way Bonzai Buddy is a program that sends mail and chats and so forth with a cutesy little purple monkey guy as the medium for this service.  
<BR>

<BR>
Most of the time this is automatically downloaded with programs downloaded onto your computer for file sharing and other services.  It most commonly comes with the Audiogalaxy Satellite.  It's not a hacker tool it's just plain annoying.  
<BR>

<BR>
But all you need to do to not get this is to download smart and read what your downloading.  And so if your son is truly a hacker they wouldn't have let Bonzai Buddy download.  
<BR>

<BR>
It's as simple as that.
<BR>

<BR>
I pity your child who is now not allowed to enjoy the internet because you are a complete fool.
<BR>

<BR>
And you've probably opened yourself up to hacker trying to hack into your system just because your such a fool.  I'd get a firewall if I were you pronto.

Like question seven "Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?".  That's like asking if your son is a teenager, he's not a hacker, he's a teenage boy, they're supposed to hate the world.  Question four, "4. Does your child read hacking manuals?".  Nothing you listed is a hacking manual, they're all novels man.  If your kid is hacking, he's getting his manuals online, not at the local bookstore.  Question nine "Has your son radically changed his appearance?"  What you described is a raver.  Some kid all cracked out on E.  If your kid is doing that, you've got bigger problems than his computer habits, it's what the MDMA is doing to his frontal lobe.  If your kid is hacking, he knows more about the computer than you obviously do, he'll get around you no matter what.

LET THEM BE THEMSELVES or they're gonna choke ... Your children are different people than you! STOP OVERPROTECTING THEM or else ...when they're gonna see what you did for them they're gonna shoot you... anyway that's what I would do...

Second: Link to "First": the gun they're gonna use will be as easy to get for them as buying a candybar because in the CONSTITUTION of your beautiful country (I'm sarcastic if you don't notice) it's written that you have the right to have a gun ... <b>YOUR</b> country is killing, as we speak, <b>millions</b> of people in Palestine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Pakistan, South Korea, Mexico, Iran, Iraq, only to name a few!

<BR>
2) it's "linux" not lunix...and it was made by Linus Torvalds, who is NOT russian.  Linux is *NOT* illegal, it is part of something called Open Source.  You can read more about that at places like www.slashdot.org www.freshmeat.net and www.sourceforge.net
<BR>
3) Most "hacker programs" can't do much, if any, real damage...most all of them are for Windows computers.  While on this subject, "Flash" is Macromedia Flash, and allows for online multimedia content.  Most every computer has it, and SHOULD.
<BR>
4) Asking for new hardware...this is usually because it's time to upgrade and get a faster system...either for better gaming, or for better graphics, etc...this is normal, and over time is needed...replacement parts will *NOT* upgrade the system, and just make you waste your money.
<BR>
5) Quake, Unreal, Diablo, Everquest, etc...These are online GAMES...they are not hacking emporiums or anything of the sort.  If they really want to be "script kiddie" hackers, they can join various chats on AOL (which sucks as an ISP btw) about it...and is useless for gaming speed, and also probably why they're asking for something better.
<BR>
6)  Strugling in school, changing appearance, becoming argumentative.....this is called growing up and becoming a teen.  We all grow through this as we grow up and push the boundaries of what's available, especially the rules which we are bound by at home.
<BR>
7) Hacker groups are rare...if they found them, they're not real hackers...real hackers don't let people know who they are...
<BR>

<BR>
Among other things, these errors lead me to believe that either you are:
<BR>
1) joking
<BR>
2) a complete idiot
<BR>
3) incompotent
<BR>
4) just blatently unobservant
<BR>
5) want to think you know more than your kids, when with electronics, it's usually the other way around...ask them for help instead of bashing on them...

OH, and Quake it's a game, that normal people play to release their angry In the other players or monsters, and it's not a "hacker community".

<BR>

<BR>
My comments: whoever wrote this article is a very worthy candidate to work for satire zines such as &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com"&gt;www.theonion.com&lt;/a&gt;  ("America's finest newssource" - or so they claim).

If you are a concerned parent and want to see the LIES that these "hackers" are telling your kids, visit this site. 
<BR>

<BR>
Be sure to look into the Herbert Kronveld articles. Click on Archives - Herbert Kronveld. It is written by an accountant who works for the ENEMY (Shaitan). 
<BR>

<BR>
Again, I would urge all parents who are in doubt as to the truthfulness of the article above, go to that website, &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com"&gt;The Onion&lt;/a&gt; and see what lies they are feeding your kids.

Linux (not Lunix) is based on UNIX, not "xenix" and is an operating system, not a piece of hacking software. Also, it was developed by Linus Torvalds, who happens to be Finnish. AMD makes its own processor line which is <i>not</i> a spinoff of Intel's Pentium line. AMD is rather respectable, and though their Athlon Thunderbirds have ways to bypass multiplier locks, this does not assist hacking in any way. All it does is void the warranty. My apologies if you feel like crap, but you are for saying stuff like this that isn't even close to true! My gosh, a Soviet developing Linux? *snickers*

Wanting to change ISP's but should stay with AOL- haha he probably wants to change ISP's because he's a lot smarter than you and knows that AOL sucks. Be careful if your child likes reading books about programming or hacker related material - well maybe he wants to be a programmer when he's older and enjoys programming. It doesn't make him a hacker. Spending a lot of time on the computer- well maybe he spends a lot of time on the comp because his neiborhood sucks and there's nothing else to do. Last, about hackers likeing to where bright colored clothes and have pacifiers, lmao a lot of the hacking related clothing like on jonxhackwear.com or thinkgeek.com isn't bright colored it's just like regular clothes but with a twist, and where did he find this so called information about pacifiers, no one with a brain sucks on them, they are for babies only, damn. I just want to say that I think this dude is way off coarse about warning parents about their children becoming hackers, you don't need to worry about hackers it's the script kiddie's you need ot watch out for, they're the ones who don't know what they're doing, not the hackers.

<BR>

<BR>
Now about your son i'm sorry that your son is (or probably is) a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
1. Has your son asked you to change ISPs? 
<BR>

<BR>
Most American families use trusted and responsible Internet Service Providers, such as AOL.
<BR>

<BR>
   (in my opinion AOL SUCKS!!!) I've used AOL once before when i was like 8 years old it sucked. My mother got AOL and about a year after she got it it stopped working (i'm not going to explain). I tried everything to get it to work from uninstalling AOL reinstalling AOL, uninstalling her modem and reinstalling it (that's not all i did but those are a couple of them) Nothing worked. 
<BR>

<BR>
   If you're doubting my knowledge i've been using a computer going 15 years now. THEY HAVE INTERNET SECUIRITY PROGRAMS TO PREVENT ADULT CONTENT TO BE ACCESSED, but that dosen't matter, because if they really want porn all they got to do is open a P2P application and type in any Porn related words (i.e Cunt, clit or even porn).
<BR>

<BR>
"I would advise all parents to refuse this request. One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter. This filter is vital to any parent who wants his son to enjoy the internet without the endangering him through exposure to "adult" content."
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, the adult content part i agree with.
<BR>

<BR>
2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? 
<BR>

<BR>
"Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under 
<BR>
"Add/Remove not install/remove"
<BR>
"Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel.
<BR>
 
<BR>
Yes you can find them if they are in fact installed not all "Hacking programs" need to be installed. Bonzi buddy, & comet cursor are not "Hacking programs" they are programs vulnerable to hacking. "Do you open up comet cursor and type in where it says Hack another computer with comet cursor the name of the computer you want to hack ? No because it's not in there !"
<BR>

<BR>
The best option is to confront your son with the evidence, and force him to remove the offending programs. He will probably try to install the software again, but you will be able to tell that this is happening, if your machine offers to "download" one of the hacker applications. If this happens, it is time to give your son a stern talking to, and possibly consider punishing him with a grounding. 
<BR>

<BR>
There's always a way around that message popping up. Let me give you a quote "Nothing is ever secure," ~ Me
<BR>

<BR>
3. Has your child asked for new hardware? 
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers are often limited by conventional computer hardware. They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. If your son starts requesting these devices, it is possible that he has a legitimate need. You can best ensure that you are buying legal, trustworthy hardware by only buying replacement parts from your computer's manufacturer. 
<BR>

<BR>
RAM - i have a question, what do you think it's for ?
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well. 
<BR>

<BR>
Where did you hear this ?
<BR>

<BR>
4. Does your child read hacking manuals? 
<BR>

<BR>
If you pay close attention to your son's reading habits, as I do, you will be able to determine a great deal about his opinions and hobbies. Children are at their most impressionable in the teenage years. Any father who has had a seventeen year old daughter attempt to sneak out on a date wearing make up and perfume is well aware of the effect that improper influences can have on inexperienced minds. 
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, this is another point i agree with
<BR>

<BR>
"Programming with Perl" by Timothy O'Reilly ~ What's wrong with programming with perl ? or any other programming language ?
<BR>

<BR>
5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son spends more than thirty minutes each day on the computer, he may be using it to DOS other peoples sites. 
<BR>

<BR>
   That comment kinda twarks me off... what kinda ignorant comment is that ? I, still being what might be considered a child, stay online or offline playing games sometimes i'm on for like 5 hours a day (sometimes even more when i read articles like this). Do i run arround DOSing you or your site or E-mail bomb you or anything like that no... Nor do i do it to anyone else.
<BR>

<BR>
   (you know i think you're one of those paranoid people who thinks little space men are going to take you away or that the government is going to get you cause you know too much).
<BR>

<BR>
DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services. This can take up to eight hours. If your son is doing this, he is breaking the law, and you should stop him immediately. The safest policy is to limit your children's access to the computer to a maximum of forty-five minutes each day. 
<BR>

<BR>
Umn... No, DOSing is (well i don't have a great definition) sucking up resources of another machine by way of "Flooding" the bandwith that a server or computer has by sending multiple tiny packets of info(sometime modified packets) which causes the computers resources to run so low that it cannot run any longe.
<BR>
DOS ~ Denial Of Service
<BR>

<BR>
6. Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. 
<BR>

<BR>
Seriously where are you getting this info ????
<BR>

<BR>
7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour? 
<BR>

<BR>
As a child enters the electronic world of hacking, he may become disaffected with the real world. He may lose the ability to control his actions, or judge the rightness or wrongness of a course of behaviour. This will manifest itself soonest in the way he treats others. Those whom he disagrees with will be met with scorn, bitterness, and even foul language. He may utter threats of violence of a real or electronic nature. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now this may also be the effect of a Gang or some of the symptons depression, or mistreatment.
<BR>

<BR>
8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"? 
<BR>

<BR>
BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos,before the Russians lost the Cold War.
<BR>

<BR>
Hold it a second (if i am correct it isn't lunix it's linux) these aren't Illegal operating systems.
<BR>

<BR>
 It is based on a program called "xenix", which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people's computer systems to steal credit card numbers. 
<BR>

<BR>
Stealing credit card numbers ???? what a waste of an example you don't need Linux to get that.
<BR>
Another quote "Ignorance is not bliss when it comes to Computers," ~ leo ????(the screen savers).
<BR>

<BR>
They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. 
<BR>

<BR>
Listen well why do that when you can go download it from the internet with less trouble (answer that).
<BR>

<BR>
Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, 
<BR>
responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as "telnet", which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone. 
<BR>

<BR>
Which comes with Microsoft Windows (Imagine that).
<BR>

<BR>
Your son may try to install "lunix" on your hard drive. If he is careful, you may not notice its presence, however, lunix is a capricious beast, and if handled incorrectly, your son may damage your computer, and even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional. 
<BR>

<BR>
If you see the word "LILO" during your windows startup (just after you turn the machine on), your son has installed lunix. In order to get rid of it, you will have to send your computer back to the manufacturer, and have them fit a new hard drive. Lunix is extremely dangerous software, and cannot be removed without destroying part of your hard disk surface. 
<BR>

<BR>
Another question, IS IT YOUR GOAL TO TRY TO SCARE PEOPLE WITH MIS INFORMATION ???????????
<BR>

<BR>
9. Has your son radically changed his appearance? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son has undergone a sudden change in his style of dress, you may have a hacker on your hands. Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this)
<BR>

<BR>
Yeah and people who do drugs wear this kind of clothing and have a pacifier around there neck because they need something to suck on (usually people who do extacy).
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
10. Is your son struggling academically? 
<BR>

<BR>
If your son is failing courses in school, or performing poorly on sports teams, he may be involved in a hacking group, such as the infamous "Otaku" hacker association. 
<BR>

<BR>
Ok, well i know people who no jack squat about computers who fail badly. In the way of the whole computer rots brain makes math hard comment i have this to say I USE THE COMPUTER QUITE A BIT AND MY MATH SKILLS ARE STILL AT PEAK I've been placed one math class above my grade level. 
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"Hacking is an illegal and dangerous activity, that may land your child in prison."
<BR>

<BR>
Yes that is true VERY TRUE.
<BR>

<BR>
Now anyway about that poll remove it at once for it is useless and contains untrue info.
<BR>

<BR>
Some homework for you
<BR>
Give me ten differen definitions of hacking from ten different sources tell me the name of the sources. IF YOU GET THE DEFINITION FROM A BOOK TELL ME THE EXACT NAME OF THE BOOK AND THE PAGE #.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">You know, I don't really know why so many people bash violent games and such.  Aside from wanting to blame other people and things for their own mess-ups.  But beyond that, games don't really do a lot.  I mean, I play many "violent" games, such as Quake, Metal Gear Solid, Red Faction, and many, MANY fighting games.  But do I feel myself ever getting the urge to just go and kill some people?  No.  In fact, video games like the ones I listed have helped me to release my anger.  By killing virtual people, I suppress my anger towards real people.  Now, would you rather I snap a guards neck in Metal Gear Solid or snap my friends neck because he angered me?
<BR>

<BR>
Also, how do people get the idea that you can hone ones actual shooting skills by playing Quake?  Unless you have a gun that has a keyboard and mouse on it, you won't be any better after playing Quake.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, on appearences, there was something said that hackers have glow sticks and wear pacifiers.  This is not a trait of a hacker, but more of a trait of an ecsacy.  If your kid is often found with those, well, you have more of a problem on your hands than a hacker.
<BR>

<BR>
And on 'radiation from the computer screen' causing grades to drop, that's just totally untrue.  My friends and I spend a lot of time on the computers, and we all have 'A' averages, some of us with 'B' averages, but nothing lower.  So you can't say that 'radiation from the computer screen' (if there is any) causes a dumbening process.
<BR>

<BR>
On hardware for the computer, no one likes a slow computer.  Whether online service or games or just loading up simple programs like Microsoft Word.  I'm sure that you don't want to connect to the internet and wait five minutes for a site to load, much less than you'd like to wait five to ten minutes for a game to load up, or a document to save/load.  And hard drives are always nice to have.  You can put more music, more games (which don't have to be violent, and can be educational), more programs for learning and just doing school or office work.  So extra hard drive is good.  Video cards, well, they're good just for games.  They have no use in anything else.  So, well, I wouldn't worry about the kids buying some video cards.
<BR>

<BR>
Final point, just because you didn't install a program doesn't mean it's bad.
<BR>

<BR>
To end, remember that there is mostly more than one use of something.  Just because you think it is used one way, doesn't mean it's not used a different way.  What you think as a bad program might be seen as a good program to help with things, like homework.  So before you delete or limit things, research it and find out it's bonuses as well as it's problems.

You stupid peice of shit, your going to warp the minds of all other stupid naive parents out there.  "My son is listing to music played on an electric guitar, i think this is a good sign of him being a hacker". HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS REFLECT BEING A HACKER? YOU STUPID FUCKING OVERPRETECTIVE WHORE.
<BR>

<BR>
the linux kernel, yes it is called linux, was invented in Finland by a programmer by the name of Linus Torvalds.  You stupid misinformed fucker.
<BR>
Maybe if you checked out the link that you improperly made you would actually know some of this instead of making wild accusations.
<BR>

<BR>
Another thing, AMD is probably the best processor company out there.  Of course, it would be virtually impossible to create a very intricate processing device by a fucking 6 year old in pakistan.  If you did some fucking research you might just fucking realize that AMD came BEFORE Intel, makinng copying off their processor designs impossible.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe he wants a new video card because he wants a better video card to get more out of his computer, oooh....a real hacker would have no real use for a newer video card you stupid dumbfuck.  or maybe they just want to get it so that they can play a better game of quake, which 1) is not "virtual reality" 2) does not train people with firearms and 3) does not even have anything to do remotely with hacking.

You dont even understand what hacking is you stupid fucker.  "oh no! my son is fucking using comet cursor, he must be using his various choices of cursors to hack into the fbi mainframe and dos them"

My hair is spiked, I wear bright clothing, I spend a fair bit of time on the computer, and I support Linux(The author mispelled this perfectly good program's name as Lunix.) Before you dismiss me as one of the sociopaths outlined above, I should probably mention that I also have an honour roll average and a good part-time job. Out of a sense of duty and pride, I find it nessecary to dispel the pos orly researched and paranoid article posted here. For the sake of simplicity, I'll sort them by the "reasons" given:
<BR>
1. Changing ISPs will not make an incredible difference as far as hacking ability goes. Rogers and Sympatico are equally harsh on abusers of their systems. On top of that, AOL is an inferior (if cheap) ISP which is undesirable for many reasons beyond its protection systems.
<BR>
2. I have never heard of Comet Cursor or BonziBuddy, but Flash is an animation program. Many of the animated gimmicks you see on the net were created with this totally benign program.
<BR>
3. I was unaware of the AMD controversy you mention, though the processors are available in Canadian stores.
<BR>
4. Snow Crash, though it has some unorthodox religious statements, tells nothing about the art of hacking. Cryptonomicon is the fictitious story of a WWII codebreaker. Neuromancer is a science-fiction story not unlike the movie "Blade Runner."
<BR>
5. I'm not going to comment on this one, I've never heard of DOSing...
<BR>
6. Quake is a GAME! It involves firearms, but offers no major insight as to their usage. It is also waning in popularity due to the release of Halflife, believed by most to be a more fun game.
<BR>
7. This is one of the few ounces of truth here, but not all computer users become like this. In fact, I'd say that the disaffected types are the exception, not the rule.
<BR>
8. Linux is a high-quality, well-designed operating system. Computers couldn't be hacked before the cold war, so Mr. Torovoltos is probably ficticious. Stereos cannot be hacked, and mp3s are copied from CDs using commonplace, legal devices known as burners. Also, accessing the Net without a phone is nothing special. Anyone with cable or DSL access totally ignores the phone lines.
<BR>
9. Clothes don't make the person. The accusations here are roughly akin to saying that one wearing a tux is a stage magician.
<BR>
10. The Otaku are Japanese movie enthusiasts. The real threats are the Cult of the Dead Cow and DefCon.

If it is, indeed, a joke, you have my most sincere admiration - I have never seen so subtly ridiculed the attitude of some ignorant people who panic when facing something they don't understand - and the fact that they're also proud of their ignorance. If it is not, I would suggest you try and get some *facts* about hacking, computers, life, the universe and everything.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
If any of you sensible people would notice, most of these "Hacker Traits" that were stated are very vague and open-ended. Also, the traits could point towards any group of people, young or old. The guy who wrote it must have taken a long time online to type it up... Could he be a hacker as well? Hmmm? Bah. I think not. Just another hypocrate in this world here to waste our time.

I do artwork in my spare time and I've got a cute animation with nice music on my web site and I made it with Flash. Am I a hacker Gibbons? Maybe you say? Well, if I gave you the original file for the animation, can you prove that I'm a hacker? With only a nice animation? I think not. As for the other various programs, I can be sure that none of them could cause any major harm unless they are downloaded illegally from some random site(Then there is no way to know if the files were tampered with or not). 
<BR>

<BR>
Hmmm... Downloading files is bad you say? Gibbons, you silly fool. People download freeware and shareware from places like download.com every day. Downloading is always a part of being online... Doesn't a browser need to download files and pages before you can take a look at them? Of course it does! I'd like to see someone who can go online without having one file downloaded and stored on the computer at any given moment.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and one last thing: Acedemic standing has nothing to do with becoming a hacker or not. If they do bad, the cause could be from various sources... One main cause is Parental Negleance or Parental Ignorance. This is where the parents are so diluted in their own realities that they don't notice the feelings of the child/teen. The guidance from this dilusion just causes more problems, making the child/teen feel useless or unwanted. This eventually leads to lack of motivation and learning.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

   The electronic music that has some riled up about is nothing more than music. I like techno and "Music made with Electric guitars and other electrical instruments". But of course this music is deemed unacceptable by you jerkoff over protective parents. You know now in these year every type of music has some computer use in them. For those of you who thought Bob Dylan using a Electrical Guitar was bad you should be beaten down by a mob.

   Bonzi Buddy is a program that generates a parrot or Purple gorrila for you to interact with.
<BR>
The Parrot or Purple gorilla are not in cohorts to steal government secerts!

<BR>
   For those parents who teach there kids about past experiences and tried to inform them about different subjects i salute you. As for you stressed out loser moms and dads who wont find the time to talk to your kid and try to stay away from your house just so you dont have to talk or interact with the "fruits from your loom" i think you are horrible parent and should have never had kids. 
<BR>

<BR>
   Ok, on another subject, any of you people who feel like you will be disgraced if you child gets a failing grade or smokes a joint. Lighten up. There is more to worry about than your kid making a 55  on a paper or getting stoned. I suggest you let the kid learn what it is like to fail a class or get a MIP and have to suffer the legal consequences. No one like for their parents to rip the kids head off and shit down his or hers neck. I doubt none of you parents like it when your boss gets upset with you or when your mother and father did it to you. The "get back for the crap i had to put up with during my childhood" style of teaching your kids is not the way you keep your kids connected to you. The Adolesent pushing away is not because or the time in life but the fact that the kids parent had been too overbearing earlier in the kids life.
<BR>

<BR>
 Dont think your king of the world when you have children. Just lighten up and let your kids make thier own choices in life. Dont make them exact copies of you. That is the last thing this world needs

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Dear Sir,
<BR>

<BR>
When I read your message my first thought was that it was one of the best jokes I had ever read. The second was that if it is not, your children's life must be hell.
<BR>
I am not really interested in showing you that your son is or is not what you call a "hacker" (your definition is sadly incorrect, by the way), just to try and get some of your "facts" straight.
<BR>

<BR>
Let's go together through your points:
<BR>

<BR>
1)Has your son asked you to change ISPs?
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
So what? If you're using AOL, it might just mean he's started to learn something about the Internet. AOL is one of the worst ISPs around, and maybe your son has heard/read about ADSL or cable connections, which offer superior performance. And by the way, AOL's "protection" is little more than smoke in parents' eyes.
<BR>

<BR>
2) Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing?
<BR>

<BR>
I understand that. I'm a control freak myself, and I ended up assembling a new computer for my wife because I hate *every* modification made on my computer without my direct intervention
<BR>
But how, exactly, should that prove that your son is a hacker? It would seem to me that you demand to screen every single program your son runs - and given the level of knowledge you demonstrate in this post, this would be roughly equivalent to having my granny personally check the ability of the pilot of every airplane I'm going to board.
<BR>
The programs you mention, in particular, couldn't be more unrelated to hacking. Bonzi Buddy is a particularly annoying web assistant (I know - my wife uses it). While it could drive sane men to murder, it is most definitely not a "hacking tool". Comet cursor is a stupid utility to do stupid things like changing the shape of your mouse cursor. Flash is a graphics design program geared towards small animations to embed in web sites.
<BR>

<BR>
3) Has your child asked for new hardware?
<BR>

<BR>
Again, I fail to understand how that makes him a hacker. "Hacking", as you call it, has nothing to do with powerful hardware. Fast CPUs, large amounts of memory and faster video cards do not have *anything* to do with hacking. Hacking is a typical low-resource activity. They, anyway, have much to do with video gaming, so perhaps your son is simply interested in those.
<BR>
And you might find it interesting that AMD stands for *American* Micro Devices, it's one of the largest chip manufacturers in the world and most definitely does *not* use child labor - the idea is laughable. You have evidently no idea of the level of skill needed in every stage of the chip manifacturing process.
<BR>

<BR>
4) Does your child read hacking manuals?
<BR>

<BR>
Those you mention are *not* hacking manuals, even assuming these mythical beasts exist. I have never read, alas, "Snow Crash"; "Cryptonomicon" is an interesting flight of fantasy on data encryption; "Programming with Perl", for Pete's sake, is or should be a standard textbook in many computer science courses, and I'd be extremely proud if my teenage son (which I don't have, see later) was trying to master it. It is used in a myriad of environments, and if your son becomes a Perl programmer, chances are he'll never be unemployed. "The hacker crackdown" is more about the US justice system than about hackers - and not at all about hacking. Microserfs is about work and personal relations in the so-called "new economy"; again, not a word about hacking, although a very interesting read for anybody who wants to work in this field. And "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is a book about how much fun it can be writing software, and about the new software development model that came out with the so-called "Open source revolution".
<BR>

<BR>
5) How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?
<BR>

<BR>
Again, how should this have anything to do with hacking? There is very, very little you can do in thirty minutes, apart from reading your email. I won't even mention your rant about DoS, because it's evident that the friend who explained it to you either is an idiot or was terribly misunderstood. I assume your ludicrous statement about "gaining command prompt" comes from of vague remembrances of the MS-DOS command prompt, mixed up with a misunderstanding of what "DoS attack" comes from. Please, get some factual information.
<BR>
Having said this - it's not healthy for a kid to spend, say, 8 hours a day every day in front of a screen, whatever he does, so you might have a point here disregarding your worries about hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
6) Does your son use Quake?
<BR>

<BR>
Well, now, really...
<BR>
Quake is a *videogame*. Very violent, not really suited for a kid. Again, nothing to do with hacking. Oh, and the idea that they train to use firearms is laughable - the game is about as realistic as a 007 movie. And the "chat" feature it has is just to pass very brief messages to each other during multiplayer games. Its pace is so frantic that trying to convey any more information in that little chat window would lead to a quick frag (have someone explain this to you).

7) Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?
<BR>

<BR>
Yes he is. It's called "being a teenager". The fact that I still remember when I was one is the main reason why I have 3 cats and no children.
<BR>

<BR>
8) Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?
<BR>

<BR>
Here I was tempted to call you names.
<BR>
Oh well. *Linux* (lunix is just a small 8-bit BSD-like implementation for *very* old machines like the Commodore 64) is a free operating system loosely based on Unix. It was developed by a Finnish programmer named Linus Torvalds, now resident in the US and working for a chip manifacturer called TransMeta (which makes the microprocessors embedded in many palmtop-like devices). BSD *is* Unix. Neither of them is am "illegal" OS (although Microsoft would very much like to make them so). 
<BR>
A huge part of the Internet runs thanks to Linux and BSD. Xenix was a Microsoft implementation of Unix, which was not  developed for the US government, but simply as a foray into the server market (didn't really work); and Linux is based on another Unix-like OS developed mainly for didactic purposes, called "Minix". So you seem a little confused here. Mandrake, Debian, SuSE, RedHat and many others are simply Linux distributions: perfectly legal software compilations which cost a fraction of other OSs and give far better value for money.
<BR>
Again, if I had a son, and I found out that he has installed Linux on his PC without any help, and was experimenting with it, I'd be very proud of him. And again, I'd know that if he gets good with it, he'll never be unemployed.
<BR>
Linux is used for a billion things. Surely hackers use it - but hacking is really platform-independent, you don't need a specific OS. And I stress that again: Linux is an Operating System, not a program. Do yourself a favor and look up the definitions.
<BR>
Telnet is a small program, a very basic Internet utility which Windows has, too. It is used to open a remote terminal session: yes, to connect to a remote computer. Still, if you don't have a connection (i.e., a telephone or an ADSL connection) you can't reach anything. Not sure what you meant there: that it is something that magically connects you to another system by some sort of computer telepathy?
<BR>
Mp3 is not a program at all: it is a standard for music compression and archival, a file format. Sort of .doc format for Word and .xls for Excel, get it? Many people convert their music CDs into MP3 to be able to play them off their computers.
<BR>
If your son swaps copyrighted MP3 files over the Internet, he's not a hacker: he is, as somebody else pointed out, a thief, and it's got nothing to do with computers.
<BR>
Oh, and there is no way on earth you can use a computer to break into somebody else's stereo - the idea is really funny though. What about my fridge? And my microwave?
<BR>

<BR>
9) Has your son radically changed his appearance?
<BR>

<BR>
See point 7)
<BR>

<BR>
10) Is your son struggling academically?
<BR>

<BR>
Dear sir, this is complete, utter and absolute bollocks. I'm sorry to have to put it so bluntly, but it's the truth. Would you please explain to me how is it possible that if your son is involved with some "hacking group" (another mythical beast nowadays, but anyway...) the radiation is frying his brain, but countless writers, academicians, journalists and IT professionals spend hours every day in front of a computer screen and they retain their capabilities? (well, except for journalists, I know)
<BR>
Oh, and meningitis is not a psychological illness. For your own peace of mind, please, look up the words you use if you're not sure.
<BR>

<BR>
One last thing I would really, really like to point out: those the whole world nowadays calls "hackers" are not at all real hackers; so I have used the word incorrectly in my reply to make you understand. Others have pointed out links to definitions of the original meaning of the word "hacker".
<BR>
In that sense, I am a hacker, and many other perfectly respectable people are - even Bill Gates claimed to be one (not that I find him particularly respectable). The criminals you read about very seldom are real hackers. I would suggest you look up that definition as well.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
"Has your son asked you to change ISPs?"
<BR>

<BR>
I have personally asked my parents to change ISPs a number of times.  AOL is slow.  It takes a very very long time for web pages to load.  It also disconnects often, which is very annoying.  Cable/DSL is much better.
<BR>

<BR>
"Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?"
<BR>

<BR>
Dude, most normal people are like this during adolescence.  I sure am, and I'm no hacker.  I don't know the first thing about it, in fact.
<BR>

<BR>
"Has your son radically changed his appearance?"
<BR>

<BR>
Don't even fucking go there man.  The way a person dresses or arranges their hair has nothing to do with it.  Stop trying to appear intelligent.  You are only fooling those as ignorant as you.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Hopefully, due to the amount of trouble our AOL has been having, the FBI will assist you in procedding with criminal investigations agains these horrible hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
I have been informed by a fellow concerned parent of a new underground hacking tool - a highly complicated terrorist training program knowen as "Counter Strike".  In this program computer hackers meet to be "terrorists" and so called "counter-terrorists" where they also train in the use of fireams.
<BR>

<BR>
I represent a group called PAIN or "Parents Agains Inter-net Nonsense", a team of fellow concerned parents dedicated to getting rid of these hackers on our AOL.  We will assist in any way by lobbying the FBI to bring these dangerous fellons to justice.

You have no idea what the hell you are talking about.  I have been to school for many years studying computer science and never in my life have I come across an article that made me think what the hell is America coming to?  Never had I heard such nonsense.  The writer of this article makes me think that how can a magazine allow someone to write such junk that is not only bullshit but sound just like a national enquirer writer wrote it!  I think that editors should get the facts straight before they allow someone to publish such a piece of shit article like this.  First thing just because your son or daughter wants a bigger hard drive or faster processor doesn't mean that he/she is or becoming a hacker.  Second buying a better video card also does not mean anything to which the author stated in his unresearched piece of shit.  People buy better video cards so they can watch dvds on their comps, play games with better graphics, watch tv, and in most cases for video conferencing.  Next item on the agenda, what the hell does mp3s have to do with anything? Techno? Don't get me started. You either truly are the most dumbest idiot in the world or you just wrote this article to gain attention to you magazine or website, whatever u want to call it!!  Next time get your stories straight!  Another thing before I go what the hell kind of school did u go to? No one in their right mind uses AOL.  AOL was made for people who has no knowledge of anything to do with computers, people who dont want fast speeds, people who just want the internet for their families,a cheap means for internet, and no brain idiots like yourself.  Just because your son/daughter wants to learn about things let them learn.  As long as they dont go breaking into banks, making fake credit cards, fake ids , or anything of the sort, let them learn!  Learning is power and if u stop your child from trying to do something he/she likes I would call you a bad parent.   We should encourage our children to learn as much as possible. Im not saying let them learn it all, but our jobs as parents is to keep our children from doing harm or coming to it.  Why not get off your ass and stop thinking stupid shit and go with your child see what he/she is doing and explain to him/her what they can do or can not.   When they are young do you not teach them not to touch the hot stove.  The same way we teach them how to talk, walk and crawl, we should allow them to expand their knowledge and just monitor their progress and actions.   That is all I have to say.  I can write a book on this subject.  Again I just have this to say you are truly the dumbest person on the planet if what you wrote on this site you belive is true!!!!

If your article was a joke- I am sorry, but if it wasn't... You should really do more reasearch. Actually no, you probably wouldn't get it anyway. Your son is abviously a script kiddie, and also a raver. So next time, don't try to monitor his activities on the computer; instead see where he spends his time. I can almost guarantee that he goes to raves, drops e, and sucks on his pacifier. Don't take his computer away, take the glow sticks. So don't spend your time writing stupid manuals for parents.

This person's kid sounds just like me. The kid is really good with computers and sounds like he'll be making very good money in the future. <b>This parent is putting a huge dent in this kid's learning and not letting him find his full potential.</b> The author has no knowledge of computers and because of that has no right to falsely blame their kid for being a hacker. Being a hacker takes a long time to learn I've heard. I have never seen a ten year old break 128-bit encryption, If one has please tell me (nickvh@barrysworld.com). 
Also <b>All hacking is not bad!</b> Only bad hacking is ever publicised. You can hack video games to get a better score, hack a motherboard to overclock. Hacking is doing something to software/hardware that the manufacturer never intended. I hack roller coaster tycoon all the time to get more money.
I ask that if the author reads this that they let their kid on the computer again immediately until they have adequete proof of it being true(FBI agents at the door, snipers on your neighbors roof). If your kid was a hacker he would already be caught by now. It is not that hard for the gov to track down a hacker, it could take 15-20 mins tops to track him. To sum it up if you are the author and you actually care about your kid email me at nickvh@barrysworld.com and I'll tell you why he does everything you listed and why it was foolish to do what you did. And to the son, I simpithize for you and hope that your parent(s) do not ruin your life.
Thank you very much.

Last note:
I am still extremely outraged and my tumy hurts.

if somehow your some sort of concerned parent (which i doubt), you are indeed a sad person that needs to be informed, I suggest taking a course in Information Technology at your local university, with your crackpot view's you'll give the lecturers laughing for months on end.

I thouroughly enjoy playing around and tweeking my created programs to suite the needs of myself. Does that make me a hacker??? Currently I am learning a A.I language called Jack, and have been offered full scholarship by IBM.

Your childeren must be really fuckered up aren't they.  Man if you believe in god, and have the best interests for them at heart, let them be, let them persue their own ideas.  After all, how are they going to know how to get and apply everyday information from the real world, to factual ideas, and purposes, if they are used to mommy and daddy saying that "such and such is bad and evil, and they are forbiddin by god from even thinking about doing it, or exploring the possibilities of something, or else they will go to hell," and all of that type of shit talk.

Being a 15 year old male surrounded by this pop culture of hacking I couldn't agree more, BUT..Some points like "Quake" is nothing more then a GAME. Sure theres a chat program where they can share information, but 90% of the time, we use QUAKE for GAMES. Second, apperance COULD mean something, but then you would be jumping to conclusions thinking your child is a hacker becaue he dress' "skid-ish". And last of all (probably the most arguable) is the OTAKU. First and foremost I am an OTAKU, and I'm not some hacker destroying peoples computers. OTAKU's are people obsessed with mainly VIDEOGAMES,MANGA (japanese comics). That's a japanese word for many of our Japanese brothers. All and all OTAKU is not a hacker, of all things it's not even close. BUT, i still have to agree you're points like if "the child" becomes aggressive, and prone to agruments, or if they spend wayy too much time on the internet.

Most of those "signs" of hacking are either due to poor parenting or buying your child a shitty computer.  If your child is an asshole, becomes part of a subculture, stops studying, or becomes violent, it's because you're a terrible parent.  If your child wants a faster internet connection (not slow-ass AOL) or downloads shareware, or likes Linux, or wants a faster chip, it's because the computer you bought your child is slow as ass you cheap deadbeat parent.  Try being more supportive of your children, or maybe taking an interest in the things that they enjoy.  If you just crack down on them when they do anything you don't understand, and then go back to watching TV and worrying about your menial job and drinking can beer, you child may become an asshole.  It's doubtful they'll become a hacker though.  Any fucking moron raised by someone as brilliant as you has no chance of becoming a hacker.  Maybe a child pornographer, but not a hacker.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Re-read #3. Read it. If you think the person who wrote this is a moron, read it again, you moron. I had a good chuckle at the article. Then I had a laugh at the first few replies from the kids. Then I looked at how LONG the list of replies was and I realized that this was a f*cking joke. From the beginning to end, every reply must have been written by an idiot. You've been had. And that's all there is to it.
<BR>

<BR>
I was just glancing around when I read this. For god's sake, PLEASE DO NOT POST MORE REPLIES TO THIS SUBJECT. Hopefully, the next person who reads this, completely misunderstands it, and wants to reply will first read this (my) reply. What was meant to be a joke turned into a really pathetic one. Leave it alone and go do something else.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Can you explain why then  Hewlett Packard uses them in a computer? They are incorporated right into the machine at the factory. These aren't after market chips and aren't put in at the computer store. The chips work in conjuction with the programs that are specific to HP and are on the CD that Hewlett packard supplies with their computer in case you have to do a restore.
<BR>

<BR>
You say that your son is a hacker but yet you, after only a few days, gained enough computer savy to find his so-called hacker programs. If he really was indeed a hacker you wouldn't have found any of his programs, cos he would be computer literate enough to hide them so that someone that only after a few days of playing with the computer  wouldn't have enough computer savy to find them.
<BR>

<BR>
I would say that you either don't know what a true hacker is or you are very paranoid..and what is worse you expound your misinformation to others.

Comet Cursor is a program that changes your computer cursor to different images. Flash is an FXP program. Its a faster version of an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) and can send and recieve files... a more hyped up Napster. Is Napster a Hacker program? 
<BR>

<BR>
You are the kind of parent that watches over their sons and daughters so much that they get repressed, and bad things start to happen. You cant judge your son on the things you said, because any shmoe could do it. BTW its LInux not LUnix... dumbass. Did you know that their are highly paid jobs for the FBI that involve hacking? Or maybe you did not think of that. And what the fuck is girls not able to hack? Go into some chat rooms, if you are smart enough to, and see how many girls are there. Ass.

I laughed so incredably hard at this stupid shitforbrains entry, and you should look on how stupid you are acting towards your children. You are an idiot, and you should not be able to be a parent, dumbass.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It's been proven that keeping your kids away from, sex, foul language, etc.  Will make them more curious to do it without hear/seeing it.

I'm not saying let your kids watch xxx, but a normal R rated movie is fine.  Foul language isn't going to hurt anyone, they are just words.

Also books they read.  Come on, if they read let them read anything, at least they are reading.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">If I wished to be a computer hacker, I am sure that I would have the mental capabilities.  I put my intelligence to other use though.  Saying that girls are not capable of hacking is ridiculous.  Girls are equally as intelligent as their male counterparts.  I feel like I was being set back 30 years when reading portions of this article.
<BR>
The antifeministic overtones were not only insulting but also outdated.
<BR>

<BR>
When people spend 30 min on a computer, that is barely enough time to check e-mail.  Let's have a reality check here.
<BR>

<BR>
I can also explain to you why people wear glowsticks, pacifiers, brightly colored clothes, baggy pants, and listen to electronic music.  These people are not necessarily computer hackers.  They are ravers.  Yes, a raver can be a computer hacker, but it definitely does not go hand in hand.  So, you ask, pacifiers?  Why?  Ok, at raves a lot of people roll on E...take a drug called ectasy.  A common problem with being on it is that when high, people tend to bite their own tongues.  So, a pacifier is used to prevent this from happening.  And the clothes you mentioned, is rave attire.  I have been to raves before, but I do not use drugs.  So I am not saying from personal experience, but from what I have seen.  And a further note, there is nothing wrong with electronic "techno" music.  I like it as well as oher types of music, and guess what?  I am not a hacker.  If your son is dressing like this, maybe you have more to worry about than him hacking.  Then again maybe not.  Don't jump to conclusions.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
women certainly have the innate ability to become hackers, chess champions or scrabble pros. most of the time, however, they are more likely to live their lives in healthy ways combining a variety of activities. the singleminded pursuit of a questionably relevant skill is usually something seen in men.
<BR>

<BR>
women tend to live in supportive communities, no matter how socially inept they are.
<BR>

<BR>
socially inept men, however, are ostracized by their very competitive peers. they then drive themselves to be the best at some microscopic area of the world. if the ostracism is intense enough, they will pursue the skill 16 hours a day
<BR>

<BR>
that's why women are going to make inroads into professions that take many differents skills (law, medicine, politics) before making serious inroads into more geeky fields.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

by the way, don't talk about things you don't know a SH*T about. If you'r smart enough maybe you can figure out the letter that is suposed to be instead of the star. Good luck!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Some note of interest for you though:
<BR>

<BR>
A) AMD is NOT a Third-World Corporation! I know the USA is going to Hell in a handbasket, but I was as yet unaware that it has fallen ~that far~.
<BR>
(Or could it be that you hold Austin Texas for a Third-World Zone??) BTW I think Craptel SUX!!
<BR>

<BR>
B) Linus Torvalds is a Citizen of Finland.
<BR>
As a matter of fact I toss this info in as a bonus to you.  Finland WAS NEVER A PART OF THE USSR!!!
<BR>

<BR>
C) Linux is just another Operating System to someone with a Peanut Brain (Like you), watching someone input 12 lines of code to make the Clock show up, could be easily forgiven as someone with Hacker skills. As one must ~FIRST~ know a bit more about Computers then just pressing a Button to turn on the Box!
<BR>

<BR>
4) As for Comet Cursor and Bonzi buddy:
<BR>
I know of NO SELF RESPECTING HACKER THAT WOULD USE THAT CRAP. After all that what is more commonly known as "Spy Ware" and as such no one needs this Crap on there system!!
<BR>

<BR>
Flash is a common enough Program Language that is needed to view Website animation or other FLASH animations it's otherwise totally harmless!!
<BR>

<BR>
5) it's called DDoS (Direct Denial of Service) Dip$hit! DOS (on the other-hand), is the Command-line prompt of the local PC!! The One has absolutely nothing (in so far as), to with One another!!
<BR>

<BR>
6) To rebut your point 7: 7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?
<BR>

<BR>
I'd say that Fist off THANK GOD I'm NOT RELATED TO YOU! Second prehaps it's not your son that needs to change. Grow a Brain please!!
<BR>

<BR>
In closeing I just have to say what a damn shame I have to breath the same air with someone as totaly stupid as you! it's a wonder that you could come this far to post this Crap. I put it to you sir that YOU ARE A HACKER for just being here!!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
Your ignorance proves exactly how much you know about the hacking society. 
<BR>

<BR>
I first became interested in hacking approximately 4 years ago. I first started with little knowledge of what my actual aim was. My first aim was to be cool and hack stuff. At the time i had no clue to what lay ahead of me. But in due time i began to understand the true essence of a computer hacker. It is not your sterotypical view of a destrutive teenager who attacks and defaces at will. It is a person who has the will to learn, and in these days and ages, not many teenagers want to put time or effort into learning anything. 
<BR>

<BR>
In my early teen years i was a wild child, i sued to take various amounts of drugs and my life was on the borderline. One day i came home to see a new computer on my homework desk. I always wanted a computer. From then on i began to spend more time studying the computer and its operating system. It intrigued me to how fun learning could be. It got me away from the drug invested streets that i once frequented. It gave me a clear mind. It gave me a hobbie, i life and a passion to learn. 
<BR>

<BR>
I began programming and web designing. I exploited a second local system that i had constantly to learn more, installing OS after OS in order to gain information on each one. I downloaded the source for a small os and studied how it ran. I really am impressed with how my life changed. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now i secure a semi sized local area network and i make more money than i thought i ever could. All those years of hacking (which is what your son was doing) paid off. It got me away from certain areas of lifew where i didn't need to be. The fact that you have banned your son from studying this great science disgust me. You should have asked him to show you exactly what it was he was doing. I bet in 5 years time he could of being chief programming engineer for microsoft, but because of your ignorance he might just be another face in the crowd.
<BR>

<BR>
I want you to read a famous piece of written work by a person named the menthor. All the sterotypical comments against hackers he defends. And he does it all so well. If you actually took time to read this then your views may be somewhat different.

<BR>
Mentor's Last Words"
<BR>

<BR>
Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"... Damn kids. They're all alike. But did you, in your three- piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world... Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me... Damn underachiever. They're all alike. I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..." Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike. I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here... Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike. And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all... Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike... You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.
<BR>

<BR>
This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
<BR>

<BR>
Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual,but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
<BR>
==================================================
<BR>

<BR>
The art of hacking is one that is commonly misjudged. You should revise your post and think about giving your son back his computer. Adult you may be, but your actions are that of a 5 year old.

<BR>
Some of you people really need to grab a dictionary and check up words like "parody" and "satire". I know they're strange words, but you might actually learn a thing or two...
<BR>

<BR>
If you still thinks this article is for real, click on the links embedded in the text. Like the "law" link or the "seventeen year old girl". 
<BR>

<BR>
If after this you still take the article seriously you're a hopeless case, parody and satire are just too difficult for you to understand.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, heads up to the person who wrote the article, the Internet needs more intelligent humor.

2. Do I have to ask daddy to DL and Install an IM?

3. Daddy! This 486 Compaq Proliant is slow! Can we get at least a real processor like AMD and not have to pay $200 more for the same processor speed like Intel.
<BR>

<BR>
4. Broaden the child's technical ability to detect the "Nasty hackers" who knows, he may get a job at a security firm.
<BR>

<BR>
5. How do you DOS to other people's sites? Everyone needs a hobby; maybe junior can't catch a football or ride a bike too well.
<BR>

<BR>
6. During Quake I often find myself chatting on how to breakdown an MP-5 (Hard to get those rollers back into the bolt carrier when you place it into the upper receiver, what's your secret?) NOT!!!!!
<BR>

<BR>
7. What do you think is going on with junior? He is becoming a teenager, damm what did they blame that on before computers?! 
<BR>

<BR>
8. Well I've never heard of LUNIX being produced by Microsoft for the government (What is LUNIX anyway??)  Is that like LINUX based on Unix, an operating system that is far more stable than Microsoft can even imagined!!
<BR>

<BR>
9.  All hackers conform to the same dress code so that they might easily identify each other and so that law enforcement can track their every move. BBBUUULLLL!!!! This is another case of a boy becoming a teenager.

10. Maybe your some is having problems at home or has a learning defecate. A.D.D. sucks and I can speak from experience, until he receives treatment it is hell.

As a hacker and an IT consultant :), this is the dumbest pile of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  This is so stupid that I dont really want to even post a response but it made me mad.  
<BR>

<BR>
Here are some thoughts, Linux is the best operating system on this planet, with the promise of making the code your own instead of depending on Micro$oft or Macinto$h.  Linux represents freedom and should not be confused with hacking.  
<BR>

<BR>
Terms like "password recovery" should be associated with hacking, not Bonzi Buddy, nor Flash.  Snow Crash and others are phenominal fiction, not to be confused with actual hacking techniques learned from sites that I dont care to mention here, or passed on from friends.  
<BR>

<BR>
Glowing colors, and changing appearance are more of living as a teenager and if we want to make asumptions, we should go with "your fucking kid is on drugs".  Exstacy, LSD, Crystal... these things are the fun of teenagerdom and are a phase that we all work thru or die.  Survival of the fittest.  Drug use would also be associated with drug use, and not hacking... true hackers dont use drugs regularly, as it impares our ability to hop into remote networks, plant our viruses and trojans (like windows xp, which is the easiest os to hack, thanks mr. gates), so our handy work is done, sending us your credit card info while we are sitting in a lounge chair on huntington beach, spending your money.

I checked your links, and see no way for me to get in touch with these "scene whores" you referred to.  I am looking for them.  It is very important I find them, preferably by this evening.  additionally, I would like to find three or four of them in a group, so I can get them all at once.  Please post how I can do this - I am desperate.  Oh yeah - please don't insult my purple monkey any more.

Delete this crap. You don't get a shit. Quake... dangerous?!? What is this, really?
<BR>

<BR>
As I said, you don't get a shit. "Hacker" isn't a bad word! Have you heard the word "cracker"? Well, therein lies the great "evil" you're talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
Hackers build. Crackers destroy. Half of the internet wouldn't exist without hackers. You owe those people an excuse.
<BR>

<BR>
Bonzibuddy is a screenpal, a little guy that can keep track of your email and help your work, though mainly disturb you. It has NOTHING to do with hackers. Neither does Flash, a normal program for making movies that can be shown on the internet.
<BR>

<BR>
Don't write things that you don't know anything about down and scare the heck out of people. I tell you, once again, to close this silly page down. HACKER IS NOT A BAD WORD.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>
more memory, faster hard drives, graphics acceleration are inevitable as you continue with computer systems and things become more and more complex.
<BR>
Using a computer game (Quake) to further your moronic 10 steps or whatever they were is childish in itself, to say the least.
<BR>
Guys dont teenagers usually radically change their appearance on their own? We all fit in that category, be careful!
<BR>
"we tried to encourage in him, when he refused point blank to admit to his activities. His denials continued for hours" That reminds me of the salem witch trials (The Crucible)
<BR>
Your so-called evidence is insufficient, you're not a model parent, you're a home-dictator. The same way cults work. When kids want to expand their knowledge, you cut them off and tell them what they need to know. Then do a public display of this nonsense to try and get more people doing it.

You should learn more from your children<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
and as for O'reilys Programming with Perl book...ITS A FUCKING SCRIPTING LANGUAGE DUMBASS! you might as well publish a book on HTML and call it "hacking with HTML" -_- you're assuming that a language is used for hacking when it isnt normally. did you ever stop to consider that many of the webpages and graphics and programs you use have java, C, perl and other languages? are webpages hacking? no, dumbass. *smacks you*
<BR>

<BR>
you need to do some more research before you open your trap again. seriously man, im not even a huge computer person as far as knowing how to "hack" and all the languages goes, but im smart enough to tell that you're a dumbass.

you deserve a swift kick in the ass.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Hey, I feel really. Sorry. One of my friends I used to sail (in real word!!) together send me your stupid article with the subject "people are crazy..". At first I thought you are kidding. Then I thought you dont know what the words AMD, Matrox, etc. really means. Now I know, you dont know the meaning of the word "hacker"!!! You say hacker for everything you dont know or dont wanna know. For example: Matrox is one of the best VGA card makers in theis world. You said they make dual-head cards for hackers becose only they use them. You are an idiot.<b> Professional users of any profession uses dual or more monitors.</b> My whole family works at a TV station ant there are dualhead VGAs in every PC. The use it for video editing, sound editing, etc.<b> And, they use a 3rd monitor too!!!!! hackers dont use dual monitors...</b>

AMD is one of the best CPU maker on the world. You said you cannot buy it in a store. It maybe true in america, but its not tre in europe. Here you can find AMD CPUs in every single PC store... and there are no security features in intel processors.

Quake is a world-famous game, and its only a game! "..It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking.." <b>You cant even talk in it!!!!! did you ever see a player talking (chatting) in quake?? How could somebody chat about ANYTHING in a game where you have to press 6 keys simultanously?? </b>

Linux was developed by american youngsters. AND its shareware, not free! Linux was based on UNIX whixh is the well known in the server-business (servers are big computers at big companies like AOL, Microsoft, and any goverment) and they use couse its much better than MS Windows.. And you can easly delete Linux from any computer! Who told that you have to buy a new HDD (hard drive..)? maybe a HDD salesman?? :))) looser..

MP3 stands for MPEG 1 Layer 3 and its an algorithm and a file type, used by MILLIONS in this world, and it ONLY used for music, nothing else. Electical giutars were used by big people, like the Beatles, Rolling stones, abba, boney M, etc. Thats YOUR music, not mine or your son's..


I can repeat: I feel sorry for your son. You dont know what are you writing, and the big problem is that others -who are, maybe, not as idiots like you- read this and think you know something. But you are an idiot. You say things about big companys, but if they read this and want to teach you a lesson - you could pay millions of dollars for saying bad things about them.

And, at least, I can tell you, Im not a hacker. Im a normal boy with NORMAL parents, using the net for them too, searching for good things to their work, living in a NORMAL way, like everybdy else.  in a small country, Hungary in Europe. You probably dont even know were it is. But I know much more than you about computers, and I try to learn YOUR language, because I HAD TO, but you dont even know how to say out my name. And you're speaking about you want to be a good parent. <b> You are an idiot, and your son will leave as soon as possible to get far from you and your crazy ideas. </b> Asshole... <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Quake is one of the coolest GAMES ever made, and maybe their may be ACTUAL hackers playing the game and doing other things to it, it is NOT a hacking realm. Its a game. Linux wasn't made for hacking (to my knowledge, and when deleted I don't believe it ruins your harddrive.) You are a total idiot oblivious to the actual world and are too busy keeping your children safe, when really you are making it worse. And faster video cards?!? You don't need a video card for hacking! It's for GAMES! And asking for more memory, memory is a good thing! It makes your computer run fast so you can play games faster, surf faster, open programs faster, and much more! I swear.. You are one messed up person. And saying that because they listen to techno makes them a hacker? Well I fit the "profile" of your hackers, but except i listen to metal, which is way differant the techno. But you really, really, really need to figure out what you are talking about. And as someone else said, exactly what are your terms of a "hacker" you peice of crap?

<BR>
A hacker is someone who knows a system Inside and Out. That DOES NOT mean that they crack systems.
<BR>
You might want to look into something a bit more befor you 'flare' it on the net.

First off, changing ISP's from AOL, anyone who know's anyhting about computers knows that AOL is the least reliable ISP of them all.  The parental controls are nice but guess what If you werent computer illiterate you can do that without aol.  Then, of course, i loved the part about programs you didnt install.  Bonzi Buddy and flash are hacker tools! Who would have thought?  No wait, you are just the dumbest man alive.  Bonzi buddy is a little purple monkey that talks to you nonstop (probobly a product of your daughter)  and flash, well this might be over your head but, flash is a web development tool normally used for developing websites.  Utilizing flash you can make animated intros to your website.  And then theres the other great fun thing better hardware? ohh yea guess what your computer is outdated about every two weeks of course you're gonna get asked for better hardware when your box is obsolete.  Then there was the quake bit, i loved that, they train you in using firearms, because you know so many hackers use firearms.  Or not, your son probobly plays quake for fun ive never heard of hacker training there.  And then there was the other fun part "IS your son reading books about hacking?" well that might be a little obvious you dolt.  Ohh and changing your happy little OS.  Well it may not have occured to you but, despite its popularity, MS windows is horribly unreliable and in all reality should be shot in the head (if it had one).  and &lt;ul&gt; linux &lt;/ul&gt; not lunix, is an os based on windows but written as an open source OS to do server activity like UNIX the first one ever, it does not, however, steal credit card numbers.  THe funniest part is your lack of understanding of human nature, do your kids get surly? umm sir guess what that is? its called growing up he's sick of your bullshit so he's gonna start acting way different, and i dont blame him jerk.  Then the other great fun part was the dress, hackers dont dress different you idiot the dress you described would have been a "party kid" or a raver,  the pacifier would be a sign of "ecstacy".  I love it when people try to make an arguement and know absolutely nothign about the topic.  If you would really Like to figure out about hacking id suggest reading a book on it you might learn somethign, you might just learn how to protect yourself from hackers!! <BR><BR></FONT></td>

I think by the second paragraph it became abundantly clear that tongue was firmly planted in cheek on this article. Apparently the hacker community has no ability to appreciate a good joke. Or perhaps it's just satire that doesn't focus on swear words that eludes them.

1) About the child possibly wanting to switch ISPs? AOL, put simply, sucks. For example, when you want to send a file attached to an email, although you probably don't know what email is since you're so computer-illiterate, AOL freezes the browser so you can't do anything else at the time. It's also extremely slow, <i>and</i> it logs you off after ninety minutes automatically, even if you're not inactive. <BR><BR>

2) About the "faster video card", more drive space, more memory? Video cards have nothing to do with hacking; what they do is let you watch videos on your computer. Lots of people want more drive space and memory, especially if they listen to Mp3s.<BR><BR>

3) About the child's appearance? Oh, sure, hackers wear bright clothing. We should all just wear black, dull clothes and not stand out at all.<BR><BR>

4) About the illegal programs? Comet Cursor is a program that lets you change the appearance of your mouse cursor on the screen and can not in any way be used to hack. Bonzi Buddy is a stupid program that has little animated animals pop up on screen if you're having a problem with the computer. Flash is a program that lets you make animations. And Linux, not "Lunix" (you moron) is... well, I don't know what it is, exactly, except that it is not an illegal hacker program, as my school uses it.<BR><BR>

5) Too much time online? Maybe your child runs a website, and maybe it's completely unrelated to hacking. I spend 8 hours plus online every day and I am not a hacker. Where do you get off saying anyone who spends more than half an hour online is a hacker? That's nonsense! Most people can barely get anything <i>done</i> in half an hour! And the thing about radioactivity, that is so untrue. Where do you get your 411?<BR><BR>

6) Thanks for the list of books, now I'll go become a hacker.<BR><BR>

7) The thing you wrote about female hackers is so sexist it's not funny. Where do you get off saying girls don't have the computer skills necessary to become a hacker?! I have more computer skills than half the guys I know, and if I wanted I could hack into your computer right now and delete your hard drive, but I'm not going to. You know why? Some people have a thing called <i>decency</i>, Mr. Elby. Decency.<BR><BR>

8) Quake is not a hacker program. Quake is an online role-playing game.<BR><BR>

9) Lastly, did you ever think that the reason your son denied being a hacker so vehemently is because he was telling the truth and you were being a moron?<BR><BR>

Anyone from Pojo's message board reading this, which is where I got the link, this is Juunana no Onna. (And YES, Elby, that is a hacker-related s/n because I'm a scene whore!) <BR><BR>

Also Quake is a fun 1st-person shooter where you are to frag(another term of kill and bring your score up) your enemies in a battlefield, many kids play this and may say "Oh man you should have seen it I got him with a rocket launcher and he was crying." Or something like that to their friends who play the game as well, this does not mean they shot someone with a rocket.

I believe he meant: The companys intent is not to produce software for hackers but due to circumstances, it has turned out that it is most accepted by hackers.

Also, he metioned that even though people use state-of-the-art equipment, that doesn't necessarly mean they are hackers. Anyone is capable of hacking using even some of the oldest and out-dated equipment.

Sir/Ma'am, if your child hasn't played his/her accordion for weeks, it isn't a sign of them being a "hacker", it's a sign that they think it's a piece of shit either due to peer pressure or that they were smart enough to stop listening to their fucking idiotic parents and that they formed their own opinion.
<BR>

<BR>
Next, it's Linux, not Lunix. And Linux isn't a hacker program. It's another operating system. Now since you're too dumb to understand anything else, I'll spell it out for you. An operating system is what you run to access all your computer files, and everything else like that. It started what they call they "Open Source Movement", which (correct me if I'm wrong, someone who knows their computer stuff) allows you to edit the operating system freely. It's mainly used by advanced computer users. Most of the people who use it are tired of using Windows due to it's overall shittiness. Linux isn't a hacker tool, it's an operating system for anyone with half of a brain.
<BR>

<BR>
 Now, telnet wasn't meant for hacking, but it is anyways. It's put in all of the Windows machines in case you want to see your buddies hard drive to see his music/repair anything, you get his IP and fix whatever providing he's on the internet.
<BR>

<BR>
 Now, Bonzi Buddy is a shitty program that I've never used, but I believe is one of those "virtual buddies" that does stuff like piss you off by talking all the time. Flash is a programming language to make videos online. And Comet Cursor is a way to modify your cursor.(the thing where you see your mouse pointing)
<BR>

<BR>
 Now, Quake isn't a game for hackers. It's a game for anyone who likes first person shooters. I'm sure some hackers do go on it and discuss that kind of shit, but it's mainly for the people interested in actiona games. And so what if it teaches the use of firearms? So does TV? Are you going to ban your children from watching ESPN because they show hunting shows? And can't the use of fire arms be good knowledge? I mean, if someone's trying to mug you and you see a gun on the ground, shouldn't you grab it and at least make them get off of you? Or if you're at war, wouldn't it be good to know that you can shoot the shit out of some Iraqi?

<BR>
My god, there is nothing worse than a bad parent...
<BR>
I needed that laugh... I haven't laughed this hard since... I don't know, I don't think I have ever laughed this hard! I had no idea that morons like you existed! You should meet my father, and maybe he'll be like you and I'd laugh at home all the time. Being a girl, the girl hack part made me laugh my ass out... I ain't a hacker; I just seek for knowledge from Computers and Internet. Your son would probably do the same thing if you hadn't taken his PC by now. And if he was a hacker as you claim him to be he would have prospered by now and maybe made some cash over the internet (not by hacking, webdesin, or something)
<BR>
BTW I used to do all that shit that you talked about (ok, not all of it, I'm not from the US so I don't log on AOL, and those cursor and Bonzi thing... give me a break) I've had my share of games, macromedia, Linux, and all of those, and I must admit, I have been very good at avoiding becoming a hacker (whore)
<BR>
And one last question for the father? Are you on drugs??? You have to be seriously demented to post an article like that!
<BR>
BTW, I work as a sysadmin (system administrator, if you don't know what it is, try the dictionary) in a government institution, and a software developer for Linux (this is just for me, for fun)...

He probably has downloaded some cracked software - software you can find in a store (at a price of course) but that you can also download online if you know where to look (free).  A hacker attempts to get into other people's computers and either snoop around or create problems.
<BR>

<BR>
DOS in the context you're using means "denial of service".  Someone who is dossing a system/server is repeatedly pinging the system involved and making it difficult or impossible for the user to access the net. (Very basic definition but I think that's required in this case)  If he had been dossing someone's system/server you'd have heard about it because his AOL identifier would have shown up in their logs.
<BR>

<BR>
Comet Cursor is a Trojan of sorts, it's an invasive program most newbies get sucked into downloading at one time or another.
<BR>

<BR>
Macromedia Flash is a program that allows you to view "Flash" animation online.  It's free and legal.  There are even flash greeting cards available. 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is not a hackers game, it's a shootem killem game.  You can play by yourself or as part of a team.  The chat that goes on is generally about the game, not about hacking.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is a free Operating System which is very popular with people who like more of a challenge OR who want more stability than Windows offers.  
<BR>

<BR>
If the radiation from computers existed and was a danger I would think all of the folks who work on them every day might be out to lunch.
<BR>

<BR>
AOL is a dialup ISP for people who don't know much about the internet or want something simple and hassle free.  It's slow enough that anything he downloads is going to be small.
<BR>

<BR>
AMD is the only competition Intel has.  A new video card will speed up your system and allow users to play better games. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would imagine your son is looking forward to the day he can leave home and get out of the twilight zone in which he lives now.  You really are scary sir, totally misinformed and somewhat paranoid.

SECOND OF ALL, What in the bloody Hell do you mean by calling AOL a friendly, approved ISP? My God man, are you insane? Poor Peter has to put up with this? I also find it EXTREMELY funny your family are modern Brady Bunch models. I suppose the "evidence" you found was a NES ROM site. And I also suppose those are covers for worm viruses. I also suppose that I, not exactly one to be entitled a hacker(though that's a label I've recieved), will become criminally insane because my musical taste consists of classic rock and jazz, of which I noted before writing this as being called "Instruments of the devil". If you call your son a hacker, then I'd call some of my pojo buddies techno masterminds.

<BR>
I like to consider myself to be a free information revolutionist, i am 18 and by far not dumb like your pages suggests.. hackers are a brilliant group of eliete verry inteligent people 
<BR>
i gradguated from my school with a 3.84 gpa and passed my A.C.T with a 28.. you are all pointing your finger at the wrong people hackers are the ones that you see fixing the school computers, re-networking their network infustructure.
<BR>
we are the ones that the teachers trust! 
<BR>
I could leave any class without an explination ant any time and recieve no punnishment, I could also walk into class 20 minutes late without recieving the slightest glance. 
<BR>
Second of all, hackers do NOT wear bright clothes, they are the quiet ones that have their eliete clique that understands their superiority over their piers. It is for this reason that they wear dark clothes, with violent darkly hued hairstyles, and as for pascifiers, people who use acid wear them because when you take acid you have a tendancy to grind your teeth quite harshly. furthermore, hackers do not generally use acid, as far as drugs go, hackers are only the users of pot, not the abusers of pot! 
<BR>
     Finally, all of the hardware and software that you knock on is complete idiocy. any software that I utilize to gain free information in no way can by found by a non hacker. LINUX, the best opperating system in existance is widly used by hackers, but not for hacking, they use it because it is the fastest, most stable running operating system that is open source in the world. (yea i know its a runon so stfu  :D )
<BR>
Athalon processors are not hacking processors, they simply are the "best processors out their" hackers are always seeking the newest and best of everything.

<BR>
if not:
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
where did you do your "research" and what were you smoking at the time?
<BR>

<BR>
your thing is full of errors!
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;One of the reasons your son is interested in switching providers is to get away from AOL's child safety filter&lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
or maybe they want a faster, cheaper ISP than AOHell.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt; Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash". 
<BR>
&lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
BONZI BUDDY isn't a hacker program. It's a stupid little monkey that hangs out on your desktop.
<BR>
FLASH is an ANIMATION PROGRAM!!!!
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;They may request "faster" video cards, and larger hard drives, or even more memory. &lt;/CITE&gt;
<BR>
&lt;sarcasm&gt;Because all the newest hacking programs are in OPEN GL 3d accelerated graphics&lt;/sarcasm&gt; &lt;strong&gt;LIKE GAMES!!!!&lt;/strong&gt;
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;If your son has requested a new "processor" from a company called "AMD", this is genuine cause for alarm. AMD is a third-world based company who make inferior, "knock-off" copies of American processor chips. They use child labor extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as Intel, use to prevent hacking. AMD chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip! This is one request that you must refuse your son, if you are to have any hope of raising him well.&lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
I certainly hope you're joking. otherwise you are the biggest computer idiot in the world and you have never stepped foot into a Best Buy store.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;ou should also petition local booksellers to remove these titles from their shelves.&lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
or you could make a nice little bonfire.
<BR>
Also you can buy these over the internet
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt; Does your son use Quake? 
<BR>

<BR>
Quake is an online virtual reality used by hackers. It is a popular meeting place and training ground, where they discuss hacking and train in the use of various firearms. Many hackers develop anti-social tendencies due to the use of this virtual world, and it may cause erratic behaviour at home and at school. &lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yah, that's right. Quake: best selling game ever! THERE ARE MILLIONS OF H4XX0RZ in the world!
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. &lt;/cite&gt;ummm...linux was legal last time I heard. Unless in our latest crackdown on terrorism, it was banned.
<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;They may also be used to break into people's stereos to steal their music, using the "mp3" program. &lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
HAHAHAHA! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! oh wait! Using the 1337 H4XX0RiNG program NAPSTER
<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;nd even break it completely by deleting Windows, at which point you will have to have your computer repaired by a professional.&lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
or you could just reinstall windows.
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;Hackers tend to dress in bright, day-glo colors. They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes. They may take to carrying "glow-sticks" and some wear pacifiers around their necks. (I have no idea why they do this) &lt;/cite&gt;
<BR>
WAHAHAHAHA! No, those are "ravers" they are not haxx0rz. Ravers go to all night dance parties. They wear pacifiers because when they eat the drug "ecstasy" they chew their tongues if they can't chew anything else. Hackers dress like skaters and rollerblade everywhere and own multiple copies of the movie "HACKERS". ;)
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;cite&gt;Excessive time spent on the computer, communicating with his fellow hackers may cause temporary damage to the eyes and brain, from the electromagnetic radiation. This will cause his marks to slip dramatically, particularly in difficult subjects such as Math, and Chemistry. In extreme cases, over-exposure to computer radiation can cause schizophrenia, meningitis and other psychological diseases.&lt;/cite&gt;HAHAHAHA!
<BR>
electromagnetic radiation? I seriously hope you aren't a doctor.
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
I won't even go into how your children must hate you for being an uptight dickwad, going to their parties and shit. What is this? the parental gestapo or something? Have you decided to do urine tests on your children and implant lojacks in them so you know where they are at all times?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
Perhaps the more technically literate son has realized that AOL is just for people who still haven't figured out how to program a VCR.
<BR>

<BR>
"2. Are you finding programs on your computer that you don't remember installing? "
<BR>

<BR>
"Your son will probably try to install some hacker software. He may attempt to conceal the presence of the software in some way, but you can usually find any new programs by reading through the programs listed under "Install/Remove Programs" in your control panel."
<BR>

<BR>
If you were technically versed, you would realize that the programs listed in the Add/Remove Programs dialog can be removed with a simple utility called TweakUI.
<BR>

<BR>
"Popular hacker software includes "Comet Cursor", "Bonzi Buddy" and "Flash"."
<BR>

<BR>
Someone is smoking crack here.
<BR>

<BR>
"3. Has your child asked for new hardware?"
<BR>

<BR>
Computer hackers don't need the most new-fangled system that comes out on the block. They can just as easily use a 486 with Linux. As for what you say about AMD, once again, you are on crack. AMD was founded by American engineers and has products comparable to Intel offerings for a lower price. Many of Intel's processors are assembled in third world countries (e.g. Malaysia).
<BR>

<BR>
"4. Does your child read hacking manuals? "
<BR>

<BR>
Big deal. The most important part of hacking is learning to program. A good hacker/programmer can get high paying jobs. Maybe you just don't want more for your children than you had.
<BR>

<BR>
"5. How much time does your child spend using the computer each day?"
<BR>

<BR>
Last I checked, the parents should be the ones urging the kids to go out and play hide and seek.
<BR>

<BR>
"6. Does your son use Quake?"
<BR>

<BR>
Better Quake than crystal meth.
<BR>

<BR>
"7. Is your son becoming argumentative and surly in his social behaviour?"
<BR>

<BR>
These symptoms can also be exhibited if your child gets their hands on the crack that the author appears to have been smoking.
<BR>

<BR>
"8. Is your son obsessed with "Lunix"?"
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is not illegal. Linus Torvalds was a Finnish student. Getting Linux off of your hard drive is simple with the right tools (which can be downloaded from a drive manufacturer's site).
<BR>

<BR>
"9. Has your son radically changed his appearance?"
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe your child is getting into your crack. Maybe they plan on attending raves and rolling with ecstasy.
<BR>

<BR>
"10. Is your son struggling academically?"
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
First off, you information is sadly mistaken..by your actiones here, it's quite obvious that ANYTHING dealing with more computer skills than clicking AOL icons and paying insane fee's for low bandwidth is satanic. newsflash kids, Even AOL was programmed by someone, and guess what, They cant "Stop hackers" any more than anyone else..so what do they do? Hire security experts, people with skills in hacking and hacking prevention. Conclusion, all the computer industry must be a Satanic cult! Burn your Computers for the safety of all!
<BR>

<BR>
   Second, You have NO real concept of most hardware manufacturers..your vaunted Microsoft Windows is the  final culmination of Bill gates taking freeware code for old systems, and rewriting into an OS for International Business Machines (IBM). AOL, is simply Time Warner's happy little moneymaking puppet, who lets the masses get their internet fix.AMD, or Advanced Micro devices, like Intel, is simply a CPU manufacturer, a CPU is nothing more than a calculator that can run millions of cycles of (add, subtract,divide, or multiply functions )per second, it can't "prevent hacks", nor can any other standard PC hardware.
<BR>

<BR>
Third of all, Hackers recruit from all walks of life, and Girl's are just as good, if not sometimes better hackers, after all, Girls usually fare better in Mathematics than boys, and Mathematics is central to Hacking, since you need Mathematics to do any high-level programming, coding, reverse-engineering.  
<BR>

<BR>
The moral of my post? next time, you need to make an informed opinion. read material from BOTH perspectives, not just silly little "christian" books that promote ignorance and the ability to judge others without compunctions. After all, I'm sure we all know by know that the words "religious tolerance" are almost oxymorons in today's world due to your kind of people.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
AMD is Inferior?!?! LOL yeah right buddy. AMD proccesors of the same "speed" as Intel proccesors far out benchmark intels. For instance the AMD 1.2 Ghz IS faster, and cheaper then the Intel Pentium 3 1.2 Ghz.
<BR>

<BR>
And if AMD are such crooks and what not, and so inferior, why do Gateway, Dell and Packard Bell ( the 3 leading computer distributors in the world ) all offer machines with them?
<BR>

<BR>
And asking for new Hardware? WTF are you talking about? A decent hacker could do the same dmg on an ole P I computer as they could on any new one.
<BR>
MAYBE if you were talking abotu software pirates the bigger harddrive would make sense. But you weren't, you were talking about "hackers". And a VIDEO CARD?!?!?! Unlike in the movie "Hackers" hacking is full of fancy gfx. 99% of it is text, code script and crap like tho. Something a Piece of shit $10 2mg video card could display.
<BR>

<BR>
Before you post something that you actually expect parents to follow you need to do some REAL research. Not this bullshit 3 day research your supposedly did, cus its obvious you just ASSUMED everything, and thought that parents around the world should parent their children based on you dumbass assumptions.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh and catagorizing "hackers" into one catagory, is just as prejudice as saying all blacks are criminals, and all isreali ppl are terrorists or some shit like that. 
<BR>
Odds are that if it weren't for hackers, your computer wouldn't even work right now, because some BLACK HAT HACKERS would have fucked it over so much. But because of other hackers, your computer might be semi protected.
<BR>

<BR>
You obviously need to sit down with your son, and 1. apologize for all the bullshit your put him through, and 2. if he accepted your apology, ask him to start teaching you about computers, because its very obvious you dont know a thing.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Oh and amd means american miniature devices and has nothing to do with hacking, it's a computer chip, that's all folks.

Anyways burners can be used for anything, there are plenty of mp3's out there that are legal, it's hard to believe but mp3's are just as easy to download as it is to tape them off the radio. It's the radio of the ner generation, deal with it!!!

Linux or Lunix can be removed with a format. New video cards will not do anything for hacking. They will only enhance your gaming experience. Also @Home being a hacking friendly ISP... Ever read their License Agreement? Comet Cursor isnt anything to do with hacking. It changes the cursor on different web pages where Comet Cursors are enabled. Flash as in Macromedia Flash? If so, then jesus, its for making web pages better and for making intro movies for webpages etc. More memory really wont do anything for hacking. It allows you run more programs with-out slowdown, thats all. AMD is based the US of A. Some kid in a third world country wouldnt know jack shit about assembling a CPU chip. All I can really say is.... next time look into what you are talking about. You idiot! People like you should be killed. I am not a hacker, and i do not want to be one, yet I play such, as you say, hacker orientated games such as Quake II and Quake III. I was on Linux Mandrake for a while but then I formatted and got rid of it. I did not have to send my computer back to the manufacturer to get my hard drive replaced. I also got some more RAM, does that make me a hacker? HAH! I also upgraded my soundcard, now music plays more crisper and sounds sound better, does that make me a hacker? Just cause your kid wants new hardware does NOT, emphasize the not, mean he or she is a hacker! Thank you for listening, next time educate yourself better!</ol><BR><BR></FONT></td>

My laugh out loud points were when you said that "Comet Cursor" is a hacker utility. Hahaha if anyone has ever used the internet at all, they have probably come accross it, and all it does is change what your mouse pointer looks like. The funniest part was Quake though.. That made me laugh like never before. Quake is a hacker meeting and training place. Oh my god thats funny. It's a freaking 3D shooter game, and nothing more. I REALLY hope that this ignorant article was fake, otherwise i have lost all hope for mankind. I guess the sad thing, even if it is fake, is that there are conservatives with misinformed opinions like that all over the country. Poor bastards. Technology is NOT THE DEVIL!

What this amounts to is the ignorant going on a witch hunt for a witch that isn't there! Believing that a child is asking for what amounts to actually an improvement to the computer, would lead me to believe that they are learning something. Perhaps, it would be better to go back to Eygptian times, and use the abacus again. Paranoia is such a dangerous emotion, and you, Sir, are uninformed, ignorant, and paranoid. This entire thread has given me a good laugh, and is one of the funniest things I have seen online in some time.

I am a network admin for a large company. I use many different operating systems, and deal with the computer illiterate all day. Whilst I sympathize with those that don't know any better, I don't claim to be an 'expert' in the matter of which this thread has followed. However, I am also informed enough to know that the person who wrote the initial 'arcticle' would be well advised to research what they are talking about, before claiming, and giving advice on a subject of which they have no business preaching.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I am a 21 year old college student who uses <b>Linux</b>, <b>Qnx</b>, Solaris, BSD, BeOS, MacOS and, yes Windows <b>XP</b>, ME, and 98 SE.
<br>
I do web design for businesses in my commmunity. I write software applications which have been accepted by corporations across the globe. I even have had some of my software featured in computer web design books.
<br>
I do not "hack" or "crack". I like to tinker with things, but nothing illegal. I know alot about computers, hence my schooling for Computer Science and such.
<br>
Kids with <b>Linux</b> are not hackers, they are just trying to learn something. In fact, if a youngster uses Linux, I myself would praise him or her for embarking to pertain knowledge I wish I had a few years ago.
<br>
If you yourself had the mind capacity or the mathematical fueled charge to endevor into Linux, you would find a community of programmers who make an operating system which is already dominating the server market and will soon begin to take shape in the desktop niche. The sense if togetherness and  the feeling of actually helping to create something which is as much of a phenomenum as the product they are writing. This has never been possible with the general OS's such as Windows and Macintosh, since anyone can use those two. Linux requires general knowledge at best of computers. Programming and networking skills makes it even more valuable.
<br>
Linyos Torovoltos did not invent the Linux OS before the Cold War. PC's did not exist before or during the Cold War. <b>Linus Torvaldis</b> released it in 1991, when he was in college in Finland, so he wasn't even alive during the Cold War.
<br>
As far as removing it goes, it's called partitioning. (Some Linux installs even install in Windows so it's as easy to unistall as <b>AOL</b>, the <b>crappiest ISP known to man</b>. Only the stupid use it, because they rely on its child like software and color-book like setup. Real users use real software, not AOL). To remove the partitions, a partition tool will to it automatically. If you don't know how, ask you son, since he is a "hacker". If you have to send you computer back to the manufacturer, then you don't even know how to administer a child. Ask you son, he can usually remove it.
<br>
<b>Quake</b> might have gamers who are Crackers, but the Quake area in general are not hackers.
<br>
<b>AOL is the worst ISP</b>. I personnally use <b>@home</b>. Not because it is for hackers, but because my cable modem is a 4Mbps, or 8-16 times as fast as DSL. (I should know I am a DSL technician). As foar as @home goes, its users/customer are hackable. <i>Real Crackers infest @home's Windows OS users with trojan horses and control these rebot like "<b>bots</b>" to perform DDOS attacke on websites. They do it to Windows because everbody knows Windows is the OS which gets infested with viruses, and everything bad.</i>
<br>
As for <b>AMD</b>, do you have something against the superior processor? AMD always beat the equally equipped American Intel proccessors. You adults yourself should opt for the <b>econimical</b> AMD's and leave the pricey Intel in the dust (or box in the store).
<br>
It appears you have something against underdogs, since you bark at AMD, Linux, Quake, and other open source <b>free</b> alternatives. You should opt for the free, so your son will save his money so he can get an education so he grows up to be smarter than his father. (it shouldn't be too hard).
<br>
So for all you adults who think your child is a hacker, 95% of them are just having fun. You should try it yourself. Computers are very fun if you try to learn.
<br>
Your article here shows all too clear you don't know a thing about computers. Your sources must have been your even less informed friends. Every key you listed has nothing to do with a hacker. Just because some hackers use these products, it doesn't mean <b>all</b> do. If it does, then I violated 8 of these, so I must be a hacker. And you are an AOL user who thinks AOL's software provides any sort of safegaurd against the Internet.

I hope you learn something from all those who posted unavoidably negative comments about your <b>McCarthyism</b> towards many aspects of the PC world. And that was during the Cold War, not Lunix, or however you think it is spelled.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

"DOSing involves gaining access to the "command prompt" on other people's machines, and using it to tie up vital internet services."

Before you start explaining what it does, maybe you should look up what it stands for.. DOS (Disk Operating System) and DOS (Denial Of Service).. two completely different things.

"...which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone"

Er, no.. I believe you're thinking of 'Satellite' Internet.

"He will probably claim that there is no problem, and that you are imagining things...... do not allow yourself to be deceived."
<BR>
Well Mr. Hacker expert, what if they really ARE telling the truth?
<BR>

<BR>
"If your child is becoming a hacker, one of his first steps will be to request a change to a more hacker friendly provider"
<BR>
Actually, chances are they want to switch from AOL because of pornography reasons, not hacking.

And if they really DID know anything about the subject, it would be easy for them to change the parental settings.

"They may wear baggy pants, bright colored shirts and spiky hair dyed in bright colors to match their clothes."
<BR>
Correction: Thats how most kids dress these days. How could anyone that has even part of a brain think that 'hacking' could make a kid dress like this?
<BR>

<BR>
I'm done :) Like I said, for that guys sake, I hope this was just a joke! Because if not, he needs some help badly, lol.

I mean, you've got all that stuff about AMD and Linux and comments such as, "Girls in the hacking scene are commonly known as "scene whores."  How did this person come up with it?  I could read it and laugh for hours.  This quality of amusement is rare.  I'm gonna have to share this with all my friends.  So incredibly funny.  I want more!<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Since when did free speech and freedom fo the press and everything else lose 'merrit in odays soceity'?
