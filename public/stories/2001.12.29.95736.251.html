		Richard M. Stallman, ubiquitously known as "RMS", is the Patron Saint of the "open source" movement. "Open Source" is a method of software distribution which implements a means of copy protection by not distributing the final program codes.  Instead, the user must assemble this final "executive" code by hand, thus  eliminating the need for the proprietary
data which must be included in a company-distributed copy.

<p>This is all fine and good, in theory, and the Open Source movement has garnered a vast following from across the untamed corners of the internet.  In this essay, I will explore how Mr. Stallman came to embrace this movement.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>RMS was born in Modesto, California and attended <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">Berkeley University</a>.  This shouldn't surprise anyone, since Berkeley is the <a href="http://www.russia.ru">Liberal Hive</a> of America and RMS is an <a href="http://www.stallman.org/#notes">admitted</a> <a href="http://www.jkl.fi/festivaalit/kesa/press/stallman.jpg">communist</a>.  RMS began his bizarre lifestyle while attending Berkeley, where he occupied the attic of a clock tower.  This eccentricity continues today and RMS will not travel without a <a href="http://www.warmann.org/temp/rms-clock.jpg">grandfather clock and a spitoon</a>.

<p>RMS' penchant for thievery was evident from the very beginning.  His attic "apartment" was filled with equipment stolen from the Berkeley computer labs.  This was quite an achievement in the early '70s, when any computer equipment was the size of a refrigerator.

<p>RMS and his hacker friends cut class regularly, opting to spend their time and parent's money constructing illegal electronics devices designed to covertly access phone lines.  The group of pirates would hack into the phone company, and charge enormous phone bills to unsuspecting Republican professors.

<p>It was during this period that Stallman met Steve Jobs. RMS' technical savvy was far exceeded by that of Jobs and, never one to like being second-best, this caused him to pursue software hacking.  RMS' hacking ability was innate and he and Jobs formed an alliance which would later result in the birth of Apple Computer.

<p>Jobs' technical accumen was matched only by his ability to sell.  He designed the internal electronics and outer package design of the first Apple, which was financed by Nolan Bushnell.  He set RMS on to the task of developing the computer's "operating system" - a sequence of low-level MS-DOS commands which tell the computer how to decode program codes.

<p>Though a gifted "coder", Stallman was quite lazy and didn't fare so well with the new operating system.  His sloppy design and bloated codes were barely useable on the first microcomputer.  Jobs dumped Stallman and hired John Wozniack to rewrite the internal operating system codes for the Apple I.

<p>This situation didn't sit too well with RMS.  Though he effectively dropped out of college, through non-attendance, he remained in the clock tower, unbeknownst to the faculty and administration of Berekely.  His bizarre reclusiveness and tendency to "hack" only in the night kept him invisible to everyone, though rumors did circulate around campus about the "haunted clock-tower" and the deformed ghost that would occasionally appear, transluscent white, on top of the tower <a href="http://www.stallman.org/rms.jpg">playing a magical flute</a>.

<p>Stallman grew sullen and withdrew into his own world in the clock tower. He watched as the joint Apple/Microsoft empire grew to <i>become</i> the computer industry and he vowed to topple it by undermining the livelyhood of his arch-rival Steve Jobs (and, by extension, Bill Gates) with his illegal offerings.

<p>Stallman conspired with Linux Torvaledse, another Berkeley student, to create a hacker operating system which could be used to leverage the internet and wreak havoc on corporations everywhere.  RMS even went so far as to use Microsoft's innovative GUI (Graphical User Implementation) which he had stolen from Microsoft's mainframe computer and given the hacker alias "X-Windows".  Unfortunately, RMS was not able to acquire the <i>latest</i> Microsoft GUI codes and was thus forced to settle for an inferior version.

<p>RMS' continued interest in communism provided him some insight as to how to spread his hacker tool across the internet.  By stressing the free nature of the software, he would appeal to the welfare nature of the public.

<p>This marketing scheme worked spectacularly.  RMS' hacker tool is now installed on countless computers, hidden away in the dark bedrooms of <a href="http://www.etext.org/Zines/VelvetDonk/issue6/hackers.jpg">LSD-using hacker teens</a>.

<p>But Stallman didn't foresee the desire of the consuming public for <i>Quality</i> software, as opposed to his lean, second-rate offerings.  Not even a price of 0.00 could turn the general public to installing this unwieldy hacker tool known as "Red Hat Linux".

<p>Today, RMS and his following, consisting mostly of unpopular teens who gravitate toward the cult-like group of pirate hackers, continue to sing the praises of their "operating system".  Neglecting to mention that it violates current DMCA legislation.  This "operating system" is primarily used to trade illegal hacker "warez" and music videos.


<p>Popular music stars like Metallica have called RMS and his hacker tool, "the single greatest threat to artistic expression in the history of man."  And Bill Gates has noted, "They are all thieves.  They spend their time stealing instead of innovating."

<p>My hope is that this short essay has opened your eyes to the illegal Open Source movement and will give you pause when you may be enticed into downloading it, virus-like, into your unsuspecting computer.      <br><br></div>

Keep up the good work.  While writing fiction is easy, making it entertaining isn't.
<BR>

<BR>
Stallman graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a BA in physics. During his college years, he also worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. In January 1984 he resigned from MIT to start the GNU Project.
<BR>

<BR>
Stallman received the Grace Hopper Award for 1991 from the Association for Computing Machinery, for his development of the first Emacs editor. In 1990 he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, and in 1996 an honorary doctorate from the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. In 1998 he received the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer award along with Linus Torvalds. In 1999 he received the Yuri Rubinski Award. In 2001 he received a second honorary doctorate, from the University of Glasgow.

<BR><BR>This only barely makes sense, but I think I get what you're trying to say.  As was pointed out in the essay, Wozniak was hired by Jobs after RMS failed to produce a worthwhile operating system for the Apple.

<blockquote>Born on October 28, 1955, Gates and his two sisters grew up in Seattle. Their father, William H. Gates II, is a Seattle attorney. Their late mother, Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and chairwoman of United Way International</blockquote>

Oh and here's that "Linus propaganda" that osm was referring to--

<blockquote>In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University as a freshman, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer, now Microsoft's chief executive officer. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer - the MITS Altair.

<BR><BR>In his junior year, Gates left Harvard to devote his energies to Microsoft, a company he had begun in 1975 with his childhood friend Paul Allen.</blockquote>

<BR><BR>Not exactly.  If you are referring to someone with the same name in direct succession the "the second" would not be correct.  In other words if your father is William John Grace, and yours is too he would use Senior and you would use Junior.  However, there are times when this <i>IS</i> correct.  Here's some examples:

<BR><BR>Pope John Paul I >> Pope John Paul II<br>
Not father and son

<BR><BR>William John Grace >> Pillip John Grace >> William John Grace<br>
So it would look like this:<br>
William John Grace I >> Phillip John Grace >>William John Grace II

<BR><BR>Also many countries do not observe Senior and Junior.  Look at the English nobility.

<BR><BR>It is prefectly acceptable to use I and II as opposed to Senior and Junior.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

<BR><BR><a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/hurd/history.html">The GNU project was well under way before Linus began writing Linux</a> (which is a kernel not an OS).  The GNU system was already there and they were developing their own kernel called <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</a> (`Hurd' stands for `Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons'. And, then, `Hird' stands for `Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth').  While its development was taking place they learned of a kernel called Linux.

<BR><BR>You can learn why they chose to use linux and not hurd by going <a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/hurd/hurd-and-linux.html">here</a>.  Since many stupid people think the linux kernel should be called GNU/Linux (which really means GNU system/using the Linux kernel), the GNU project set out to finish Hurd.

<blockquote>RMS even went so far as to use Microsoft's innovative GUI (Graphical User Implementation) which he had stolen from Microsoft's mainframe computer and given the hacker alias "X-Windows". Unfortunately, RMS was not able to acquire the latest Microsoft GUI codes and was thus forced to settle for an inferior version.</blockquote>

This is funny.  Ok, you seem to forget that the MS Windows GUI was not all that impressive until Win95.  This GUI was later used in Windows NT.  Let's not forget that X Windows is a windowing system.  It is not a GUI (windows manager).  Wonder who realy stole what from who.  I won't get into that because that will lead to the whole MS stealing from Apple history, and I don't wanna type that much.

<blockquote>RMS' continued interest in communism provided him some insight as to how to spread his hacker tool across the internet.</blockquote>

That's funny.  This image at the top of his website read: "America Means Civil Liberties, Patriotism Is Protecting Them"

<blockquote>Not even a price of 0.00 could turn the general public to installing this unwieldy hacker tool known as "Red Hat Linux".</blockquote>

Red Hat Linux isn't the only linux distro.  You forget Mandrake, SuSE, OpenLinux, BeeHive Linux and many more.

<blockquote>Today, RMS and his following, consisting mostly of unpopular teens who gravitate toward the cult-like group of pirate hackers, continue to sing the praises of their "operating system". Neglecting to mention that it violates current DMCA legislation. This "operating system" is primarily used to trade illegal hacker "warez" and music videos.</blockquote>

You mean corporate IT rooms like those at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/Search?v=11&lang=en&cc=us&q=Linux&Search.x=0&Search.y=0">IBM</a> are run by teens?  Also it has already been found that Linux itself does NOT violate the DMCA.  Also not every country has adopted DMCA-like legislation.  In other words it's not global.  

<blockquote>Popular music stars like Metallica have called RMS and his hacker tool, "the single greatest threat to artistic expression in the history of man.</blockquote>

I though we were discussing Linux not Napster or Morpheus.

<blockquote>And Bill Gates has noted, "They are all thieves. They spend their time stealing instead of innovating."</blockquote>

Link please

<blockquote>My hope is that this short essay has opened your eyes to the illegal Open Source movement and will give you pause when you may be enticed into downloading it, virus-like, into your unsuspecting computer.</blockquote>

So OSS=Linux and linux only?  What about *BSD?  You forget that open source has been around much longer than <i>popular</i> software like that from Microsoft.  If OSS is so bad I guess you should say something to elby.

it seems like i would have to be some kind of expert to tell if the source code is good or not. i'm good with computers, but there's no way i could read through and understand source code. on top of that, even if i somehow knew the source code was ok, i'd probably have to buy software to make the compile process. all this would definitely impact my productivity in a negative sense.
<br><br>
i just don't understand the point for all this confusion and dicking around - no matter how you slice it with open source it seems like a loss. either i  get an executable that i don't trust or i get source code that i can't understand that i have to then make compile to an executable i don't trust. WTF?! 
<br><br>
now if you compare that mess with a shrink-wrapped cd with a serial key and a security hologram that contains an unaltered executable straight from the company that made the product and stands behind it then i think you will see my point here.

To believe these sorts is to believe that somehow humans write a program in an "higher order language" that is then "compiled" by a software program called a "compiler" (open source zealots are at least consistent if not imaginative in their terminology) which is then run on a US government certified Microsoft Windows compatible computer.

Clearly this is not the case, since the high order language --> compiled source step is underpants gnome business plan-like in it's vagueness.

No, clearly, computer programs are written using <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/me2/jro/aawring.html#top">ASCII art</a>-like techniques wherein the "programmer" uses "graphical user interfaces" to create "windows" and "dialog boxes" which in turn generate directly the 1's and 0's needed by the highest-quality personal computers in use today.

<BR>

<BR>
A developer is able to take part of the open source code written by someone else and put it in their own program. 
<BR>
Maybe they the original progam had a cool menu system and it would look good in the new program.
<BR>
The developer can then look at the source code and see how they did it for ideas or can completely copy the menu code into their program. 
<BR>

<BR>
It allows programmers to work faster and the best way to learn is to read open source program code.
<BR>

<BR>
You're argument about not knowing if an exe is safe actually proves why open source is safer.
<BR>

<BR>
If this malicious word.exe wasnt open source then you're right, there is no way you could ever know if it was safe. But if it was open source then people would see the maliciousness in the source code and would report it, blacklisting the author.
<BR>

<BR>
To a certain extent there are many parts of windows that work similar to open source. Microsoft doesnt give programmers the source code of the Windows API functions (unfortunately) but tells programmers how to use them in order to create their programs faster. 
<BR>

<BR>
Pretend you are making a save file window for your program. Whats the point in making it from scratch if the code is already available for it? saves time doesnt it? Imagine if every programmer had to write the code from scratch. 
<BR>
Using the same public code would also mean less bugs as with 1000's of people looking at the code any bugs would be seen and fixed.

i think you're deliberately missing my point here. my point is that if i by a CD from a professional software company i am <i>assured</i> by a <i>sacred contract</i> that the software will not harm me or my computer. if it does, then heads are going to roll and people are going to lose their jobs and no one wants that do they. see it's in the company's best interest to release the best program they can so they do.
<br><br>
and not only that, but many companys then voluntarily patch their programs after the fact to make them better. it's just professionalism.
and when you compare that to a bunch of hobbyists who's biggest motivator is getting 'blacklisted' by the other hobbyists, then i just don't see how there's any comparison.

The idea of open source isnt anything to do with stealing peoples software.
<BR>
Its not an announcement saying "I believe in open source so I can take apart any program I want".
<BR>

<BR>
The author has to announce their software open source and this is announcing an agreement to give the software and code away free and allow people to use it how they want.
<BR>
Basically the authors make the progam and then give it away for free.
<BR>
The reason why people do this is because it does help contribute to software development and shared resources online. Obviously it doesnt make any money and is why companies hate the idea. But noone forces anyone to make their programs open source.
<BR>

<BR>
Linux has been modified and built upon by countless thousands of individuals not a single company.
<BR>
Someone builds video drivers, someone else builds a GUI for it, someone else builds support for various disk drives, someone else builds system commands. Usually as a small personal project asside from their real jobs. 
<BR>
Everything is open source in linux so that other programmers can build upon existing features making them better - so if new hardware comes out, someone can make drivers to support them and then all linux users can download them. 
<BR>
The reason why its not as good as Windows is because there isnt billions of $'s behind it and hardly any full time programmers on it. But the argument is, that while it doesnt appear as good as windows, a programmer is able to change and add whatever they want in the system and customise it exactly how they want, which in windows is impossible. Also for these people it is possible to fix the bugs and security problems with linux themselves wheras in windows they'd have to wait for a microsoft update.
<BR>
So to some people linux is a better operating system - for them.
<BR>
Neither is linux a hacker OS - i mean they have two Linux labs at my university. And I know of at least 2 professors who are into developing linux.

<br><br>
Stolen source was created because RMS was:
<br><br>
1) Too lazy to take a shower<br>
2) Upset that all the real computer scientists left his criminal organization to go work for a living while he was left alone to work on criminal hacking tools.<br>
3) Upset that said REAL computer scientists would not let him "borrow" or "steal" their hard earned future work.
<br><br>
If you don't believe me simply go to the many fine RMS web sites.
<br><br>
As for your silly argument that everyone who contributes to Lunix does it because they uphold the RMS <a href="http://www.shelfhelpguide.com/attitude/shelfhome.htm">"shelfhelp" guide philosophy</a>, Pah! That is quite obviously wrong. Sneaky great companies let their employees to contribute to Lunix because:
<br><br>
1) They like to make fun of the little hackers.<br> 
2) They want to secretly see if their competitors will use the buggy code and suffer financial ruin.<br>
3) They contribute "binary" only - thereby virally infecting the bad linux virus with their own good virus.<br>
4) They have mentally unstable Lunix hacker employees and they need a method by which to identify them<br>
5) and many more!

<BR>
ONE:
<BR>
  Does it not seem to fall under your logic the fact that Microsoft DID NOT design their own operating systems, but rather stole them from Apple, XEROX, Sun, and Sony?  This kinda thing comes from 'criminal rationalizations.'  Then you could always realize that they got their standards such as IBM's AT and PS/2 standards through backstabbing.  Their optical mice were stolen from the same 3rd party organization that makes Logitech's.  Microsoft Office was a virtual replica of Wordperfect only MS Office was initially free.  Microsoft bought out a lot of computer manufacturers who wouldn't adhere to their standards.  Microsoft's .NET system is a direct attack against most similar systems.  Microsoft removed compatability with most SQL'ish database types to promote that one.  Microsoft's Visual Studio is a rip-off of borland's.  and other thins like that.
<BR>

<BR>
TWO:
<BR>
  Open source is NOT  stealing, though you might want to think it is.  Open Source is why things like CD-RW's work in Linux, and why OS's like Linux, parts of OSX, Solaris, OpenBSD, etc.. are beyond the capacity of Microsoft's and other non-open source OS's.
<BR>

<BR>
Prime Example:
<BR>
Microsoft Windows XP Professional is limited to two processors, 7 GB of RAM, NTFS file system, and has a limit on the max hard drive space ( though I cannot remember what this limit is at the moment. )
<BR>

<BR>
Linux is limited to 8 processors, no limit on RAM, just about any file system, and unlimited hard drive space.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

you think a corporation ever does something nice because it wants to do something nice? not on your life shorty, a corporation ONLY ever does something nice to better its image, avoid litigation, increase profits, increase branding, placate its employees, or better it's customer relations. and anyone whose head has not been replaced with a horse's ass understands that.

Publicity is NOT always the #1 reason to do things.  But besides, for a corporation to done anonymously to anyone would result in HUGE litigation problems ( assuming they DID donate as a corporation ).  A person could donate ok, but truely a corporation is just not able to.
<BR>

<BR>
Example:
<BR>
A corporation is ran by a board of directors who vote on certain issues.  If they found, let's say, 30,000 dollars missing they wouldn't know what to do.  It would be reported stolen, and depending on the corporation and the situation at the time they may/may not pursue it.  But if it happens enough times, they WILL and someone WILL get fired for it.  A corporation usually has to report EVER PENNY to the government so that they may claim as many tax deductions as possible.  Missing money = missing deductions = high taxes ( note that a corporation's money is usually taxed TWICE instead of just ONCE so every deduction REALLY means something ).  This means there's no realistic way for them to donate anonymously.
<BR>

<BR>
Of course, that's just one side.  Did you know that non-profit organizations must report all of their money to the government as well.  Anonymous donations don't always go over well.
<BR>
"The greatest harm comes from the best intentions."
<BR>

<BR>
So maybe it is you who should take a critical thinking class.  Obviously you don't quite understand the way the corporations must operate in order to continue to do so properly.  Like I said, you should probably read a few books on ECONOMICS and CORPORATE RULES in order to understand this properly.  Maybe they ARE donating with their name on it, but how often do you hear them bragging about it?  When was the last time you heard about a hospital bragging in an interview because it supports medcare/medicade patients?  When was the last time you heard a corporation ( other than Microsoft and other KNOWN corrput corpers ) saying about how they donated to this or that or something else?  Really?  
<BR>

<BR>
Besides, learn to criticize properly.  You don't have to be childish to get your point accross, sir or ma'am.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

is that a bad thing? nope. what the hell <i>else</i> would motivate a company?
<br><br>
i brought up anonymous acts to illustate this point since that's the only situation i could think of where a good act would not have self-interest as its base motivation. capish?
<br><br>
now normally i don't spend this much time trying to educate myopic hippies, but i'll give it one more shot: you know how some tuna companies will use dolphin-safe nets? yes, they do that to try and kill less dolphins and yes they do that to be responsible with the environment and all that other happy horseshit, but under all that lurks a single motivation: SELF-INTEREST. see, if nobody cared about dolphins, the tuna company wouldn't either. same goes for your crazy 'they would hire robots example'. they don't keep from hiring robots because they know it would be bad for <i>people</i>, they keep from hiring robots because it would be bad for <i>business</i>.
<br><br>
and this was the point i was making. corporations act out of self-interest alone.

now go beat off or find a cool sticker for your bong or do whatever the hell else you dirty hippies do while us realists are <i>working</i>.

The only dearth of software is software that runs on Lunix. There is an embarrassing variety and quantity of quality Windows software whose creation continues to flow unabated. In fact, the flow accelerates year after year after year. This is true for music, for books, for anything under copyright. We are literally drowning in Art and Science thanks to copyright. And yet, you've obviously ignored the opportunity to learn any of it.

That's because Lunix software is GPLed. Under the GPL, the "fair use"  doctrine does NOT apply as it does under copyrighted works. If you so much as copy one line of GPL code from function foo(), your entire program must be GPLed as well. If you quote that line of foo() in  a computer article written for a trade publication, a school textbook meant to educate children, or something for popular dissemination in bus and metro stations, <i>the entire publication</i>  must be put under a copyleft license!
<BR><BR>
It's unamerican and little wonder why Lunix users have no software except an EMACS editor to write no software on.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Renick on your comment about GPL:
<BR>

<BR>
You obviously don't understand the GPL.  The GPL does NOT EVER require you to release your copyright on particular material inside a source code or a binary/object code.  Any parts that are your's still remain your intellectual property and are subject to all laws pertaining to such as long as the GNU does not VOID such laws.
<BR>

<BR>
You ONLY have to distribute and allocate your program as GNU if you were derive, in part or whole, your program from a GNU program.  This means that NO, copying one line from function foo() does NOT put your program under GNU's GPL.  Rather, copying the entirety of function foo(), or the threads that would be similar enough to prove in a court of law the derivition of function foo() in a given program would require you to put it under GNU's GPL.  There ARE allowances and the License is not a kill-all.
<BR>

<BR>
Never do you renick your ownership of Patent, copyright, or ANY intellectual property when you accept a GPL of ANY kind.  In fact, it's ILLEGAL to do so for any Patent or anything other than a copyright, which requires a signature and express permission in a signed and notorized form ( which you can attain from an intellectual property or property lawyer ).
<BR>

<BR>
If you have any other questions regarding GNU's General Public License please consult this site:

Ok, let me explain something to you. When person A makes a patentable discovery which person B reverse engineers, person B hasnt made a discovery. Get it? 
Person A added to human knowledge, not person B. 
Reverse engineering is not useful "research."
<BR><BR>
If patents were unavailable, person A would not have been motivated to make the  patentable discovery which person B (the open source leech) was too stupid to discover in the first place. Therefore, intellectual property laws such as the DMCA protect and encourage discovery. IP laws have done more to further the lot of humanity than any smelly hippy and his army of thieving sycophants ever will. Free men (men in control of their economic destiny) cannot make progress without IP laws.
<BR><BR>
The reason you dislike the DMCA has nothing objective to do with discovery. You dislike the DMCA because the DMCA was expressly written to deal with thieving hackers and their earnest application of RMS's self-publicized aversion to paying for honest art and invention. (In fact, RMS pays for <i>nothing</i>. RMS is an unemployed bum who sponges room and board off a legion of fawning, brainwashed terrorist sympathizers.)
<BR><BR>
In otherwords, potatohacker, you are a common thief. You are too busy stealing American innovation to have any time left for learning the English language or furthering the lot of humanity through your own PATENTABLE inventions. <BR><BR></FONT></td>

Surely this cannot be the case - a <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">hacker</a> such as yourself, posting a referance to a patent?  How can you, a person who thinks patents are invalid, use one as a referance?  Since you think patents are invalid, surely you must deny the existance of anything that they refer to, no?

Just because we have the tech doesn't mean we do it.  We've been able to travel to Mars for about 10 years, but we haven't done that.  We've created lasers powerful enough to power guns, but we don't have those.  We have computers strong enough to BE AI's, but we choose them not to be.  We have electric cars that would run fine in our society, but we don't use them.  Just because such technology exists, doesn't mean we use that technology.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Various subsystems within the set emit signals that can be easily picked up by a sensitive receiver.  This is why someone in a van parked on the street in front of your house, with the proper equipment, which amounts to nothing newer than RF gear from the 60's, can determine what channel a Television or radio in your house is tuned to.
<BR>

<BR>
Further, the lower frequency emissions of the deflection circuitry within a television display can easily contain additional information.  The V chip, for all we know, could be radiating information about what channels you regularly watch, what times your set is on, etc. to an outside monitoring instrument.
<BR>

Any receiver except for the most simple passive crystal sets emit an RF signal.  That's just the way it goes.

<BR>
Your article shows clearly that you have _no_ clue about computer science (as have some people posting in reply to this article, especially those with a PhD). (examples:
<BR>
&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
"operating system" - a sequence of low-level MS-DOS commands which tell the computer how to decode program codes. 
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
This is nonsense. OS's are usually written in C or assembler (read a book about OS development from your favorite book store) MS-DOS _is_ a OS (though not in fashion anymore!) Unix is an OS (and has been around before MS-DOS was!) Linux is just a variant of Unix and not some "hacking tool" (By the way, you also confuse the term "hacker" (somebody who writes software for fun) with "cracker" (sombody who illegally gains access to computer))
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
"Open Source" is a method of software distribution which implements a means of copy protection by not distributing the final program codes. Instead, the user must assemble this final "executive" code by hand, thus eliminating the need for the proprietary data which must be included in a company-distributed copy. 
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
This is the weirdest definition I ever read about open-source. Open source software does _not_ implement _any_ kind of copy protection! Instead it gives away the "proprietary data" (the source code) that a company like Mircosoft is not willing to share with its customers. 
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
Linux Torvaledse, another Berkeley student
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
Linus Torvalds is from Finland where he also got his computer science degree. What is this preoccupation of yours with UC Berkeley about?
<BR>

<BR>
&lt;quote&gt;
<BR>
hacker alias "X-Windows"
<BR>
&lt;/quote&gt;
<BR>
The GUI "X" (which is for graphical user "interface" _not_ "implementation" as you wrote)
<BR>
has been developed at MIT around 1985 and was intended to run on professional work stations that always run UNIX (i.e. long before anybody thought about developing Linux!) Nobody stole it from Microsoft. It is simply a completely different thing! Visit www.x.org or since you appear to be afraid to visit "alien" web-sites, go to a bookstore and read a book about UNIX where you will undoubtedly also find something about X, too.) By the way, chances are much higher to be infected by a virus or a trojan if one runs Microsoft software than UNIX variants! The code red virus, for example, _only_ infected windows machines that run a special piece of badly written Microsoft software (IIS servers, check out http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-19.html). Machines running UNIX (for example Linux) just logged a bad HTTP request during an attack and that was it!
<BR>

<BR>
The problem here is that you wrote an article about things you simply do not have a deeper knowledge about. So, go read some books, write some software yourself, and come back in a year or so, and try it again! Nobody with at least some knowledge of computer science will take you seriously.
