      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q"><p>I couldn't abide actually getting involved with any of them, though, for by 
  now I was well aware that they are too much mental pain, that they insist on 
  damaging honest men with emotional cruise missiles that rip through the keyhole 
  of the heart. A few one night stands followed, but always they tried to see 
  me again, or slung me out of their pad at 4AM, or (shockingly) threatened to 
  accuse me of rape. How to get a woman not interested in emotion, love or money? 
  A woman not given to such tripe is very rare, and I almost gave up.</p>
<p>Discussing this one day with my friend James, he suggested I visit <a href="http://www.realdoll.com">Realdoll.com</a>. 
  I think he was joking, but I am grateful to him, for he initiated a series of 
  incredible adventures with Realdolls&#153;.</p>
<p>Now, in case you aren't familiar with Realdolls&#153;, let me make clear what 
  they are. They are sophisticated silicone based dolls with articulated skeletons, 
  lifelike skins, gelatine-based breasts and are in every respect very similar 
  to the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Palace/6314/intro.html">real thing</a>. They move like women, feel like women, taste like women and 
  smell like women. In fact, they do all of these things better than actual women 
  could ever hope to - your Realdoll&#153; never has a period, or farts, or shits, 
  or smells of BO in the morning. They are in a constant state of been-tarting-myself-up-for-three-hours 
  getting ready for a Saturday night on the town <a href="http://www.sladesworld.com/cutindex.html">readiness</a>. </p>

<p>When I investigated the <a href="http://www.realdoll.com">Realdoll&#153;</a> site I have to say I was sceptical at 
  first, but I decided to give it a shot and send off for <a href="http://www.realdoll.com/cool/dolls/sample2.html">Stacy</a>, 
  a Realdoll&#153; with looks astonishingly similar to those of Julia Roberts. 
  And I have to say, when she arrived I was more than satisfied - Stacy was everything 
  a man could dream of, and more. Flexible, lithe, more than lifelike, and a sensuous 
  lover the likes of which I had never known.</p>
<p>I was soon obsessed with my new silicone friend. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/gordongriggs/DSC00061.jpg">We had such wonderful times</a>, 
  and I always bought her treats, such as new clothes (some lovely lingerie among 
  them), lipsticks, make-up, jewellery - nothing was too good for my darling, 
  and she was very grateful to me when I bought her presents - we had a real honeymoon.</p>
<p>When she was six months old, though, I began to hunger for more. It wasn't 
  long before I was looking through the website again, looking for a friend for 
  my darling Stacy. After talking to her about it a while, we settled on <a href="http://www.realdoll.com/cool/dolls/sample5.html">Nika</a> 
  , a sultry Caribbean beauty. 
  I think Stacy may have been jealous at first, for when Nika arrived I lavished 
  a lot of attention on her, and poor Stacy must have been upset. Nika was much 
  more challenging company, for she had a college degree in physiotherapy and 
  had studied the liberal arts, she didn't just <a href="http://www.geocities.com/mike_kelly_98/realdoll_convention_2_report.html">look intelligent</a>, she could hold her own in any conversation. 
  However, Stacy has always been the more engaging and nice of the two, and it 
  wasn't long before we all bonded together and became a very happy <a href="http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/realdollswingersandswappers">m&eacute;nage 
  &aacute; trios</a> indeed.</p>
<p>As you have probably guessed, this happy state did not last forever. I wanted 
  more and more, but I couldn't afford the $6000 required for a third Realdoll&#153;. 
  It was around this time that Abyss Creations, makers of the Realdoll&#153;, 
  announced that they had decided to make the <a href="http://www.realdoll.com/ads.html">Male Realdoll&#153;</a> - and a plan 
  formed in my mind.</p>
<p>The Male Realdoll&#153; is one of the most realistic dolls created by Abyss 
  creations to this day. It has no seams, and looks and behaves just like a real 
  man. My plan was simple, too. I knew from my previous purchases that the Realdolls&#153; 
  are shipped seated on padded chairs in crates (5' by 2' by 2') that are sealed 
  with a combination lock. I decided to visit the factory at Abyss Creations and 
  scout out the land.</p>
<table width="200" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" align="left">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="../../images/RealDoll.jpg"><BR>
      <font size="1"><I>Nika, who could break anyone's heart with looks alone, is also very intelligent</I></font>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>It wasn't long before I found the factory floor, and I decided to take an incredible 
  risk - that night, I broke in. I quickly located the male Realdolls&#153; section 
  and the packed crates, sitting on pallets ready to go. I spent almost 4 hours 
  cracking the combination lock on one of the crates (9999 possible combinations 
  to go through manually), and my joy was unrestrained when I succeeded. Working 
  quickly, I took out the Male Realdoll&#153; within and threw it in a rubbish 
  bin in the warehouse. I then put myself in the crate, sealed the door and awaited 
  a wonderful future!</p>
<p>For days I suffered as the crate made it's noisy delivery to my unknown destination. 
  I had some food and drink though, just enough to keep me going, and a small 
  pocket light and copy of <i>The Village Voice</i>. I really couldn't wait for my new 
  <a href="http://www.chrisrenee.com/">lifestyle</a>, it was so exciting.</p>
<p>Soon the rumblings of my container stopped and I felt my crate being manhandled 
  into somewhere. After some muffled voices, I waited in the dark for some unknown 
  time, until eventually a blinding light shot into my crate and I heard delighted 
  female cooing. My new mistress!</p>
<p>I have been blissfully happy since then, I am treated as a good doll by my 
  Mistress and I even convinced her to purchase Stacy and Nika, so I am reunited 
  with my loves, but now we are equal. I have to say I am very, very happy, and 
  now no longer have to deal with the falsities of real people, I am treated as 
  a real person and an investment.</p>
<p>And the <a href="http://www.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/02/26/sexdolls/">future is bright</a> too - Abyss Creations are constantly researching the 
  field, and I look forward to the new animatronic Realdolls&#153; that are in 
  development. They will be able to move and make love of their own accord, and 
  so will be a much more immersive experience. They will utilise powerful processors, 
  and I can only wonder how long it is before the 'Linux' operating system is 
  ported to a Realdoll&#153; and then lovers of this OS can actually make physical 
  love to their creation!</p>
<p>Also, I plan to have children and can only hope that Abyss Creations will make 
  the Child Realdoll&#153; so that I can achieve my dream. Other advantages would 
  be the disappearance of paedophilia and such disgusting traits, in favour of 
  just buying a Child Realdoll&#153;, but I think the mainstream would be the 
  chance to have a nice family that is more realistic and loving than the real 
  thing could ever be.</p>
<p>I encourage all my readers to investigate the <a href="http://www.realdolls.com">Realdolls&#153; site</a>, it is the 
  best move I have ever made, as it has revolutionised my life. Why bother with 
  the sore, dirty reality, when <a href="http://www.realdollcam.com/webcam.html">perfection</a> can be bought? <br>

<li>The woman blabs on and on and on to you about some trivial bullshit, but you're a doll so you can't tell her to shut up.

<li>If she runs up the credit card buying shoes, you can't yank it out of her purse and lecture her about finances.
<li>When she gets in a minor car accident you can't tell her she's a lousy driver and blame her for raising your insurance premium.
<li>You can not stop her from redecorating the house with tacky floral motif curtains and upholstery.
<li>If she wants to be on top during sex you must acquiesce (like most men, I find this painful).

Furthermore, inclusion of this functionality has a noticable effect on the weight and balance of the RealDoll.  You could have checked the invoice to ensure that you did not substitute yourself for a homosexual RealDoll, and confirmed the fact by the lighter nether regions of the heterosexual Doll.
<BR><BR>
Yeah, I know some gays don't "go there" but  would such a prude ever give himself permission to go ahead and buy himself a RealDoll?  Nah, those non-anal homos are the ones hanging around Baptist churches hoping to get "cured" and sucking off the ushers in the mean time.  And in any case, your odds would be changed dramatically.
<BR><BR>
Hopefully anyone else who follows in your footsteps should feel around the lower parts of the Doll he dopplegangers himself with, just to be sure.  And what if while feeling around in the Doll Region he discovers he sort of, you know, likes it?  Well so much the better!  Search no more!

I am worried about one issue, however -  what are the moral implications of RealDoll relationships? As a committed <a href="http://www.chick.com">Christian</a>, it seems to me that intercourse with one of these objects would be tantamount to onanism. If the doll is realistic enough, it might even be seen as committing the sin of fornication. I have consulted the <a href="http://www.bible.com">Bible</a> on this matter, but I have not been able to find any verses that refer to the practise of having relations with dolls. Nor could I find any reference to Christian morals in the <a href="http://www.realdoll.com/lite/faq_frame.html">RealDoll FAQ</a>.<BR><BR>
I usually ask my pastor for advice on spiritual matters, but as I am a respected member of my <a href="http://www.landoverbaptist.org">community</a>, I would prefer to keep this matter to myself. Perhaps Adam Rightmann could offer me some spiritual advice in this matter?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As for fornication, well a Realdoll&#153; is not born of a woman, therefore it is not a woman. Fornication is only committed with women who have led a chap astray. It is not born of a beast, so you are safe from bestiality too.<BR><BR>

You are saying that where the object/picture is a representation of a real woman, it is sinful? So, for example, pornography is sinful because the pictures are representations of real woman, if not actual women in themselves?<BR><BR>
If this is indeed Sinful according to the bible (and I have my doubts), I still don't think it applies to Realdolls&#153;. Realdolls&#153; aren't representations of women - they are platonic ideals of what women could be, and are not based on the brute fact of women even remotely.<BR><BR>
More to the point, I think that watching pornography is not 'lusting after a woman'. There is no woman being lusted after, just celluloid dreams, extensively airbrushed and cut, with many special effects, make up and other tricks of the trade applied. The watcher of pornography is lusting after an idea that does not exist, a Platonic ideal.<BR><BR>
However, this is not to say Pornography is not sinful - real woman, forgotten beneath all the dreams, suffer and are humiliated. Every watcher of pornography is contributing to their humiliation and degradation. For this reason, it should be outlawed.<BR><BR>
However, if computer graphics could achieve realistic pornographic films, I would not have a problem with such a thing. Then what is being lusted after does not depend on the exploitation of real women for its production, as before, but a simulacrum with no relation to the real article, the ultimate perfect ideal that can never exist in nature.Exactly the same as before, but now real women are not being exploited and destroyed as their essence is ripped from them, distilled, purified and displayed, all the rough, reality giving edges excised.<BR><BR>
Realdolls&#153; fall into this category - they are Platonic ideals, not representations of real women. Nobody is lusting after anything with any relation to real women whatsoever.<BR><BR><BR>&hearts;, bc.<BR></FONT></td>

Now, I'm very, very skeptical that this large group of people (biblical literalists such as the SBC) contains not a single person who has ever lusted for woman. I am also exremely skeptical that a single one of these people have ever removed their own sexual organs. I am more than happy to receive links showing me one way or the other.

Ye Gods, can you imagine going to one of these whacko baptist schools and getting called to the board to solve a problem when you've got a boner over little Mary Rottencrotch's budding breasts? Not only embarising, but it's peepee whacking time!

If no links documenting the lack of lust amongst these people or the removal of schlongs is forthcoming I must assume these people are either a: Complete and total hypocrites talking complete and total shit, or b: Morons. I think it's a bit from column A and a bit from column B myself.

But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
<BR><BR>

And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.

I've got no problem with those who do not follow this edict, <b>if</b> they do not claim biblical innerency. Hell, Mathew contains this little nugget of ineffable wisdom (5:44): <i>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you</i>. Yet how many Christians, especialy Southern Baptist literalists, are making a big fuss out of the fact that, according to Jesus, we shouldn't be bombing Afghanistan but rather aidng the poor nation?
<BR><BR>
As usual most believers are obviously hypocritical ones. That does make me, even as an atheist, truly admire those that do follow the actual teachings of Jesus. And no that does not mean actually lopping off your eye, hand, or penis as a literalist is not necessarily following Jesus' teachings rather than a translator's error.

But I say unto you, <b>That ye resist not evil</b>: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. -Mathew 5:39 
<BR><BR>
Amazing that Jesus can mention swords TWICE, once in an obviously allegorical sense and once with no reference to violence whatsoever, and Christians use those two passages to counter hundreds of passages where he specifically condemns any violence whatsoever from his followers.
<BR><BR>
<i>Christianity teaches us not to live by the sword. Fine - we should abstain from personal violence. But that's not the same thing as abstaining from all violence, because that makes you the slave of everyone willing to use force.</i>
<BR><BR>
So? Is your reward not in heaven? You would risk your immortal soul for comfort on earth?
<BR><BR>
<i>And while no Christian should be ashamed to be a slave, we are commanded to increase the kingdom, and in order to do that we must have power.</i>
<BR><BR>
Are you sure you are not a devotee of Islam? Islam commands it's followers to expand Islam by the sword, Christianity commands it's followers to increase the kingdom by the word of the gospel. Is your God so petty he will except adherants brought to him by fear rather than love?
<BR><BR>
<i>The only conceivable non-Christian justification for the bombing of Afghanistan seems to be cynical, Satanic power politics. Let us have none of that here.</i>
<BR><BR>
Too late, you called for power politics at the end of the previous paragraph.
<BR><BR>
You can't duck the responsibility of living up to your morals by unloading it on a state. If, as Christians so often claim, this is a Christian nation then it <b>MUST</b> live up to Christian ideals otherwise it is a state founded upon hypocricy. The US is, thank whatever, a secular nation so I can't condemn it for hypocricy like I can the Christians who make up a fair majority of it's populace.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

No you are not wrong. Of course, a decent Christian who has a decent amount of self control would never have to take such drastic measures to avoid sin. If one sins and asks forgiveness then there is really no reason to jab out an eye or anything like that. If a person repeatedly commits the same sin then yes, it would be better to lose an eye than to spend enternity in hell.<BR><BR>
As for your quote of Matthew 5:44, there is nothing there that prevents the bombing of Afghanastan. I pray for those people every day. I pray that before the Daisy Cutter bombs wipe them from the face of the earth they will see the error of their ways and accept Jesus into their lives so they will not populate the vastness of hell with their shattered corpses.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

That's a choice, not a requirement, and it doesn't guarantee salvation.  Christianity presupposes sin on the part of all men; sin causes separation from God; therefore we are all lost, and only through Christ's death can our sins be redeemed.<BR><BR>Some people believe that Christ's death saved all humanity for all time.  This is called 'universalism' and is generally considered incorrect.  (Mind you, it's kind of the 'carrot without the stick,' as far as arguments go - we should live Christian lives because it's reight, instead of because we'll be punished if we don't.  This makes it politically unuseful, and this has been a strike against it.)  Most Christians believe that we are even now in the grip of sin, and only through accepting Jesus as saviour can we (individually)be redeemed.<BR><BR>Catholics believe that baptism is the crucial first step in accepting Christ.  Then one lives a life within the Church, and is saved.  Catholic thought is wrestling with the question of whether it is possible to be saved outside the church.  Popular thought seems to be on the side of yes, whereas the church hierarchy appears to be quietly on the side of no.<BR><BR>Fundamentalists generally believe that one is saved through personal conversion (ie, the crucial thing is asking, inside, for Jesus to save you and take command of your life.)  This is in line with the universal priesthood of all believers, and the individual's personal right to an unmediated relationship with God, which are cornerstones of Protestant thought.<BR><BR>The Orthodox are another question and I don't know much about them.  Perhaps Tkatchev will help me out with that one.  Other Christian types - Jansenists, Mormons, Monophysites, and other minor or heretical branches - get stranger and stranger as you go, so do your own reading.<BR><BR>The point is that Christianity does not teach, and has never taught, that man must (or even can) lead a sinless life.  You try to minimize your sins because that's what God wants, but you can't escape them, or the condition of sinfulness, except through committment to Christ, however your church interprets that.<BR><BR>Nathan<BR>--<br><b>Li'l Sis:</b> Yo, that's a real grey area.

Although, this really needs to be differentiated from the legalistic approach Catholics take; Catholics belive that baptism is some sort of magic "ticket to heaven". The Orthodox believe that baptism is a real requirement, needed to prove that you are indeed serious about Christianity. Indeed, if you are reluctant to go through the initiation rite of baptism, you aren't really a Christian. Accepting baptism is really a minor sacrifice when eternal salvation is at stake.

Most Orthodox believe that the Orthodox Church is the one true Christian Church here on earth; this is a purely rational, pragmatic belief, though, not religious dogma. The belief is based on historical evidence and the teachings of the Church founders. (Seeing as the Orthodox Church is the only church that can be directly traced to the original Apostolic Church.) 

<BR><BR>

Also, the Orthodox belief is that salvation is always a personal matter between God and man; there is nothing that says that, for example, rural Hindu peoples will not attain salvation. Most people doubt it, but then again, we can never know. This is a personal matter concerning strictly God and man only.

Jesus Christ had said that is a sin to even think about doing something immoral[1]. In the words of Christ himself, you are committing adultery even if you think about having sex out of wedlock. That means that if you fantasise while masturbating -- you are definitely committing adultery. This "RealDoll" definitely falls under this category.

If you are indeed not trolling, I heartily advise you to join the <a href="http://tribal-paganism.org">Judaic faith</a> instead. Ignorant people like you just give Christianity a bad name, since they profess Christianity while never having read the New Testament nor ever having been to Church.
<BR><BR>
[1] Not to fear, though: God loves his creations so much that even the most awful sinners will attain salvation. All you need is to repent (key word here!) and accept God's love.

Thank you for your reply - you have definitely given me alot to think about! One or two further questions though (sorry to bother you again with my ignorance!):<BR><BR>
Does the RealDoll actually come under the heading of masturbation, since its users are not stimulating themselves manually, nor are they spilling their seed on the ground (as Onan did in Genesis 38:9)? (By the way, I am unmarried - as such, I can fornicate, but not commit adultery. Does this make a difference?).<BR><BR>
<code>"But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart." </code><BR><BR>
Since a RealDoll is not a real woman, is it permissible to lust after it? And if the possession of a RealDoll prevents men with weak resolves (like me, regrettably) from lusting after real women, could a RealDoll not be a means of saving thousands of souls from damnation?<BR><BR>
The author of the original article, although he does not appear to be of the Christian faith, tells us how his RealDolls led him away from a life of fornication and lust after women. Even though his story takes a disturbing twist towards the end, when he appears to take up a most unchristian lifestyle of submission to a woman, (Ephesians 5:23 - "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.") there are some positive aspects to his story.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

So, if you use a RealDoll as a substitute for sex, then you are committing a sin. (Fornication, or adultery, there isn't any difference in the long run.) If you are using a RealDoll just because you're a weird sort of dumbass who stimulates his genitalia without any particular reason, not even for pleasure, then I guess that would be OK.

God should be involved with, and a part of, everything you do.  A sin is a separation from Godliness.  It is something you do on your own, without God.  You can make a willful choice to exclude God from your action, or you can do an action that displeases God, and he can exclude Himself.<BR>

You should remember the meaning of original sin, though -- original sin is the choice of Adam to separate himself from God and "strike out on his own". Basically, since Adam chose to willfully separate from God, we are stuck in a sinful state ever since. You can't really live here on earth and not sin, because our ancestors have specifically chosen for it to be this way. 
<BR><BR>
Your second statement, the one about "displeasing God" is blatantly false, though. God is love, and God is never "displeased". Pagan gods (demiurges) can be displeased, but a omnipotent, omniscient creator of the universe can't be "displeased", especially because of some sort of minor injunction.
<BR><BR>
Any separation of man and God always stems from man turning away from God; this is called "free will", and if it were any other way than we'd be nothing more than automatons, puppets in the hands of God.

What a nice guy that god is.  Freedom.  Whoop, sure sounds great, that freedom does.  Too bad your god also screws us over completely and totally unless we do what your god tells us to do.<BR>

I say your god should take back this pointless "freedom" and make us the mindless slaves (or perhaps just mercifully kill us) so we can all be perfect christians.  I have better things to do then sin (which apparently you can't avoid under this "freedom" idea) and then pray for forgiveness just so I can save myself from hell.  Why would your god set us up like this?  Is that funny to him or he is not the joking type?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Hell does not sound to appealing, especially in the long term, so why would anyone choose to go to hell when the obviously better option is be a drone for our short lives and end up in that heaven place.  But for whatever reason, some people apparently do end up in hell.  Seeing how apparently we can't be a drone, why would anyone choose to go to hell?  Why not just be a good christian as god intended?  I doubt anyone would intentionally do anything that could assure them a full position in hell.  What you say?  Well when some one murders someone, it isn't free will, but rather a pre-programmed (by who?  god of course!) reaction to a certain situation (since this god guy is apparently omnipotent, and all those other omni* words, wouldn't he already know you would kill your wife because she was leaving you for the midget down the street on the same day you lost your job?)  Perhaps it isn't free will at all that we are experiencing, but rather a destiny we (or perhaps rather, you) have been programmed to think we (you) can control.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

However, with all the latent and subconcious

To accept God requires that you bridle your pride, that you accept the fact that you are not the center of the universe. Letting go of egocentrism can be surprisingly difficult for some people.

My point, if you chose to open your mind was, your christian god is all-knowning and all-powerful.  One would think he would know how people would react in ever situation, since well, apparently he is god.  Don't you think he would know that by creating someone and having them born into say, *gasp* a non-religious home, taught to not trust religious fundementalists (they kill people that get in their way!), growing up watching christian wars on TV, learning about all the hate done in the name of the lord, being beat up by the local pastor's son, that perhaps he or she would reject the christian god (and jesus, of course!).  Of course he would know that.  He knows everything.  He created this person, knowning full well they would never be able to accept him into their life.  <BR>
<BR>
Are you telling me you seriously doubt god is smart enough to do this relatively minor extrapolation?<BR>
<BR>
Call it a concious rejection of god if that makes you feel better, but anything humans (or animals) do is a situational response that is reproducable and predictible when knowing enough information (which one could only hope your omnipotent god has access to).<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">Gourdian knot with my theological perspicacity.  I think bc's claims that the Real Doll is not, <i>de facto</i>, a woman hold true.  It's plastic, rubber and metal deviously molded into the form of a woman.  It was certainly not <i>born of a woman</i>.  However I'm somewhat troubled by his claim that this tantamount to a freepass to commit whatever perverse acts with this doll that the devil may put in your head.  We all know that this Real Doll is supposed to take over the role that one's wife would play in the matrimonial bed, or if your a sicko, one's girlfriend.  In fact, bc boasts in several different places in his piece that this Real Doll is as good as a real woman- that it is so lifelike, that you'll scarcly notice any difference.  Taking this into account, it is undeniable that this doll is indeed taking the place of a woman, and is implicitly <i>as good as</i> or even <i>better</i> that a woman of God's creation.  Thus, while not technically a woman, the Real Doll is attributed many of the virtues of a woman, and is to take the place of a woman.  Therefore fornication with the doll <i>is indeed</i> sinful.  And I would suggest that you reconsider your purchase.  Bc's advice may follow the <i>letter</i> of God's Law, but it most definitly violates the <i>spirit</i> of His Law.  Though a court of man's making may see a difference, believe me, God does not.  
<br><br>
Of course there are other theological concerns.  A Catholic may find displeasure in the fact that seed will be spilt in the bodily cavities of this doll, and is therefore not unsimilar to masturbation or intercourse with birth control in that said seed would not be used to create life.  I however, would not be concerned with that.  Another thing to consider is that one's relationship with the Real Doll may constitute idol worship.  If you assign the desirable virtues of womanhood to this object it then becomes the physical avatar of these virtues- an idol of sorts.  An idol one worships through the act of copulation, and one praises by forsaking his soul in the commitance of such acts.  
<br><br>
Safe to say, you should stay away from the Real Doll.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

As I understand your post, the sinfullness of relations with one of these dolls lies not in the acts themselves, but in committing these acts to the exclusion of normal, healthy matrimional relations.

Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate." - Proverbs 8:13)<BR><BR>
