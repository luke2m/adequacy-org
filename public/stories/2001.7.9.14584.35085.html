		In late April, Senators Kohl and Lieberman <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~kohl/ftcbill.html">introduced</a> legislation that would empower the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">FTC</a> to punish companies that market adult-rated video games to children.  The <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/~lieberman/press/01/04/2001426632.html">Media Marketing Accountability Act</a> has met much resistance in Congress and in the realm of public opinion, but its swift adoption is the greatest hope going forward for anyone who recognizes the problems video games pose in an age of exponentially increasing violence and realism.        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Some would say video games have nothing to do with real-world violence.  We are somehow supposed to believe that the images children are constantly subjected to have absolutely no effect on children who view them, that they pass through children's consciousnesses like sand through the hourglass of our lives.  Every week it seems, a new study comes out confirming the link between fictional violence and real-world violence, but these opponents never budge.<p>

How many more studies can they possibly need?  And don't be fooled into thinking the problems end with violence alone.  Video games do more than just inspire violence; they <a href="http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/990318011.html">cause rickets</a>!   It's no wonder that even seasoned gamers are starting to come around, <a href="http://www.theroc.org/roc-mag/textarch/roc-15/roc15-08.htm">recognizing</a> the violence that has <em>always</em> been present in video games.  It's clear that regulation of such violence is <em>advisable and necessary</em>; what remains is to determine whether such regulation is <em>permissible</em> under our Constitutional scheme of government. <p>

Some argue that the First Amendment prevents the Federal government from regulating the violent content of video-game products.  Even if (for the sake of argument) we accept the idea that such regulation is a form of censorship, it doesn't necessarily implicate the first amendment.  The purpose of this legislation is to encourage the video-game industry to abide by tougher <em>voluntary</em> standards of decency.  <em>Self-censorship is no censorship, because no speech is <strong>created</strong> and <strong>censored</strong></em>.  <p>

Moreover, limits on the First Amendment, rooted in common-law traditions, have been recognized since its ratification in 1791.  Libel and slander, along with obscenity, are not protected because they inhibit the free flow of information and productive dialogue by corrupting the channels of discourse with misinformation and filth.  Likewise, restrictions on the dissemination of copyrighted speech are empowered under Article I, because copyright restrictions <em>encourage</em> free speech; in a world without copyright, no one would have an incentive to speak at all.  <p>

The same is true of video-game violence.  Such violence imperils our cherished freedoms of speech by removing our children's capacity for rational thought.  Though intellectually stimulating games (such as software implementations of chess and parchesi) do exist, their numbers are <em>dwarfed</em> by the heaps of games whose gameplay consists of nothing more than pure violence, games that bypass the higher-order rational-processing regions of the brain and tap into the raw evolutionarily primitive regions.  Studies have shown that <a href="http://www.newswise.com/articles/2000/7/VIOLENC2.UWI.html">violence correlates with misfunction of the pre-frontal cortex</a>.  As if rickets and other deleterious health effects weren't enough, <em>video games may be causing actual brain damage</em>.  <p>

So if video games are such a menace, then why stop with the Media Marketing Accountability Act?  Why not eliminate violent video games from adults' consumption as well as children's?  Well, the answer is twofold:

<ol><li>Adults have more-developed emotional and neurological functions than children do and so aren't affected as much by the influences of video-game violence.  Just as alcoholism is sharply curtailed by limiting the possession and consumption of alcohol to mature adults, the far-reaching effects of video-game violence can be curtailed by limiting its consumption to adults who, by definition, possess the maturity necessary for healthy information processing.  The growing incidence of violence at high schools underscores the simple fact that young people, by virtue of their being young, lack the cognitive functions necessary to interpret the dangers of their world and so <em>need adults</em> to process their world for them.

<li>Outright prohibition, alas, never works; it merely creates a vibrant black market for the prohibited item.  To return to the alcohol analogy, Prohibition during the 1920s demonstrated that it was impossible to remove alcohol outright from the daily life of adult Americans.  The imposition of a legal-drinking age, in contrast, has generally been a resounding success.  Alcohol producers have a legal adult market for their liquors, and simple enforcement prevents young people from illicitly acquiring booze.  With the video-game industry, we need only demonstrate that adults comprise a sufficient market for the industry's wares, a task that shoudln't be so hard in light of the fact that adults are the only members of our population who actually earn an income to purchase video games with.
</ol>

In short, by restricting video-games sales to adults and prohibiting the video-game industry from marketing their violence directly to children, we can go a long ways towards eliminating the violence that plagues our society.  Though future evaluation will decide whether we have gone far enough, it is clear that we must <em>at least</em> go this far.  To do otherwise would be to abdicate our responsibilities as mothers and fathers of our most precious and vulnerable commodity: our children.      <br><br></div>

So?  Why not mix and match?<BR><BR>

I remember in the mid-to-late 1980s, a magazine called COMPUTE! (which I'm sure many other folks remember) published a game called "Laser Chess."  The game was conceptually very similar to chess; you had different pieces laid out on a chessboard and took turns moving them.  Where it differed was that one of your pieces was actually a laser and the rest of them were mirrors .. you could set up complex bounce shots to take out your opponent's king.  (Some of your pieces had "exposed sides", and would be destroyed if they weren't hit on a reflective side.)  This was an awesome game, and an excellent way to combine old strategy with new technology.<BR><BR>

Exposure to real "thinking" games is critical to our children.  Without it, they will grow up mind-numbingly, slobberingly stupid.  You can't raise kids on television and Tomb Raider and expect them to be able to think for themselves when they get thrust out into the Real World.  Technology is great, but let's not let it turn into an evolutionary dead end.

Maybe it's because I read to my nephews and nieces, or because my brother and I play chess so often that my oldest nephew (at three) enjoys watching us, even though he doesn't know how to play.  He certainly doesn't have any trouble sitting down to watch any of his favorite movies, even the ones he's seen umpteen million times.<BR><BR>
Of course if chess were taught properly, any child would quickly realize how violent it is.  It is too often taught as just a game, with pieces that move so and so.  But who cares about the rules, without the story?  Two armies arrayed across a level field, and each 'piece' taken represents hundreds or thousands of dead souls.<BR><BR>
I've always suspected that the violent video games are attractive to young children simply because of the adrenaline rushes, and the feeling of tiredness after playing them for a while.  Children have far more energy than adults, especially with all the sugar water and caffeine we feed them.  They need to expend that energy somehow, and if kept inside, and forbidden to run around and punch holes in the walls, they gravitate to whatever provides them with the most release.<BR><BR>

Pride is certainly a great fault of mine, and I should be more careful.  Perhaps I should have gone into further detail, explaining my background with children in various different teaching capacities, volunteer activities, and such.  I also tried to make clear that I voiced simply my own opinions about the matter, and used personal experiences for the same reason.  But again, you are correct, and I should be aware to preview my posts more carefully in the future.
<blockquote>I have no major social problems<br>

</blockquote>
Heh heh.  Rather, in blatant parody of the Marines, I would say:
<blockquote>
These are my problems.<br>
The World has many problems<br>
But these problems are Mine.</blockquote>

My problems include the fact that I love my family, and when I see people who seem to be insulting them, even slantly, I become angry.  So when someone says that children have short attention spans, and prefer not to play certain games, I enjoy posting counter-examples.  I try to avoid pride and smugness, but they are very insidious sins.<BR><BR><BR>-fsh<BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I think you might be slightly misreading the article.  The suggestion is not to keep children from playing video games, but rather to prevent children from purchasing them, and to prevent game companies from marketing to them; there is a very big difference.  I fully agree that most children have absolutely no problems with violent video games, but there are also children who become fascinated with them.  This sort of legilastion keeps the game companies from marketing to children, who do not generally have all the sophistication necessary to ignore the blatant demands of marketing peer pressure.  This legislation also allows parents who think their children might have problems handling such software (either due to maturity or psychological reasons) to control access to these games, to be able to be responsible for their children's upbringing.<BR><BR>
Just as everyone was saying after Columbine, it's the parents' fault for not paying attention to what their children were doing.  This way, the parents could at least be sure that their children didn't sneak in to Electronics Boutique while they were trying on clothes to purchase the latest version of Unreal Tournament.  This places the purchasing responsibility on the parents, and encourages them to take an active role in their children's entertainment lives, at least to the point of knowing the names of the games their children play.<BR><BR>
That being said, I fully disagree with the law.  I am an <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/faq/">anarchist</a>, and do not believe that law is an effective replacement for morality.  But I think that in the larger scale of things, this is not a bad law, since it seems to be encouraging parental responsibility.  Of course, how it will be enforced is a completely different matter, and it is in the enforcement and interpretation that most laws are found wanting.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>-fsh<BR></FONT></td>

A key point that alot of people seem to be missing here is that <i>anything</i> can trigger a killer to kill; not just video games. It could be a warped sense of morality and a feeling of responsibility to enforce said morality, ala Jack the Ripper. Or, it could be a freaking <b>dog</b>. Would you propose any kind of limitation or restriction on our freedom to buy dogs because our neighbors might think that our dogs are telling them to kill people?

If they haven't yet, then they should, but for another reason: racism.  Double Dragon, like so many Japanese imports in the 1980s, has done more to sully American/Japanese relations than any other media depiction.  Japanese are presented as uniformly engaged in martial arts, when in reality, 70% couldn't pick a nunchaku out of a lineup of kitchen utensils if their life depended on it.  Moreover, Americans, by assuming the role of the Japanese character within the game, are given the false impression that they <em>know</em> firsthand what it is like to be Japanese.<BR><BR>

Combine this with the cross-cultural monstrosity of the Mario Brothers' Italian stereotype, and you'll see that video-game violence occurs not only within the loins of its victims but also within their minds.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>That said, I did not play sports as a child, I played video games. And thanks to good parenting, I grew up to be a very level-headed and non-violent person. Video games can influence violent behaviors, but those influences can easily be negated.

<BR><BR>Video games proved to be a very constructive hobby for me. I gained many new friendships and strengthened existing ones through playing games. They helped to establish my existing interest in technology, and set me on the path of my future. They have been very good to me.

<BR><BR>The biggest problem in video games is not the violent content (though it can get excessive) as much as much as the adversarial nature of them. Games should promote a cooperative experience between two people, not an adversarial one. This is a problem that I see getting worse.

<BR><BR>As for racism in video games, your particular example was created in Japan, which I think pretty much negates your argument. Stereotypes exist for a reason. They are a distinct trait that does exist throughout a particular group of people. In any work of fiction, they can help the audience to form a relationship with a character that otherwise wouldn't exist. Stereotypes can also be positive, negative, or neutral. And while giving Mario a funny accent and making him a plumber isn't exactly a positive trait, it's not like they made him a mob boss...<BR><BR></FONT></td>

This legislation is merely an attempt to keep corporations from marketing straight to children.  A corporation is cold-blooded, amoral, and thinks only of profits, so they can use any tactics that they want.  Indeed, they particularly favor peer-pressure (Pokemon: Gotta Have 'Em All), and employ psychologists who advise them on how best to create desire in the hearts of children.  The parents of the child can still purchase this game, and the children can still play the game, all that is being made illegal is the marketing of the game to children.  I am heartily against any legislation that impinges on the rights of fully aware adults, but as long as the child is living with the parent (and the parent is legally liable for the actions of the child) the final responsibility should lie in the hands of the parents, not the cold marketing offices of an amoral corporation.<BR><BR>
I disagree that any child is somehow destined to be a serial killer, if that is what you are suggesting.  If a problem is detected early enough, physiological problems can be cured.  But this is the whole nature vs. nurture argument....<BR><BR>
That being said, I look forward to the day when I can play Quake VIII with my nephew (3yo).  But I would prefer to play such a visceral game with him when I think he's ready, and would prefer to venture online with him myself at first to see how he responds to such an experience.<BR><BR><BR>-fsh<BR></FONT></td>

IMHO, any parent who would take the time to review a game and not just rubber-stamp it for use by their child is already doing so. Corporations don't physically abduct children and make them buy games; parents can and should monitor their children's activity on their own and not bitch about how the evil, cold, heartless corporations are stealing their children from them. Any parent worth a damn already pays attention to what their kids are doing, the ones who want this law passed are the same ones who don't watch their kids when they're playing these games, who aren't with their kids when they're buying these games. The solution isn't tougher legislation that makes it harder for non-psychotics to enjoy games; the solution is simply better parenting. Because if you aren't doing any parenting, its not fair for you to ask the government to do it for you.<BR><BR>

The most obvious is the claim that video-game violence "causes" brain damage. The referenced article said nothing of the kind: it said that certian kinds of brain damage can lead to violent behavior. It briefly discusses the possibility that these brain-damaged people might be more influenced by media violence, but it certianly does not claim that the media violence CAUSES brain damage. That is like claiming that slurred speech causes people to drink too much alchohol. I have been saturated with media violence since I was a small child, and my brain is still functioning well enough to recognise a fallacy when I see one, thank you very much.

Another claim that this article makes is that the bill only encourages "voluntary" participation in a rating system, but there is nothing voluntary about it: if this law is passed and someone violates it, they will have to pay a fine. They will not have the "option" to pay the fine, they will be FORCED to pay it whether they want to or not. Make no mistake, this proposed law would abridge our freedom of speech.
