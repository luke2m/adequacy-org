<p>"We have been through this. We negotiated. We went as far as we can go. That's the deal."

<p>Anyone reading <i>[a biased selection of]</i> the reports covering the hearing know this isn't the first time Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and the attorneys for the states have dealt with <i>[refusal to comply with questionable demands of dubious legal validity]</i>.  All through the hearing <i>[detikon believes]</i> there has been a sort of "just shut up and sign off on the deal vibe from Microsoft attoneys <i>[even though he hasn't been there, and has nothing of substance to offer in support of this opinion]</i>.  Microsoft at one time <i>[quite reasonably]</i> offered to pay the states' legal fees if they would just shut up and sign off.  Sorry, MicroSoft, but you were found guilty and <i>[may be]</i> required to pay them <i>[once the appeals process is over]</i> anyway.

<p>Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly and the states didn't put up with it the first 10 or 15 times <i>[nor have MicroSoft's attorneys agreed to the blunt demands and sham of compromise offered by the states]</i> and are not about to this time.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I actually read this story before it was editted.  I was over a The Register and had something to do so I couldn't come back and respond until now.  Give that he did provide the notice at the bottom (which seems to have vanished) I believe The Register would feel that it was ok as it did provide some notice as to the link provided in the story.  However, it's relly up to The Register as to whether or not they see it as such.
<BR>

<BR>
I have seen numerous articles on this site which make no mention of The Register or other new sources.  Usually it's from linking obscure words.  I can do a search if you doubt me.
<BR>

<BR>
Now to the legal matter.  The judge order the states and Microsoft to hold negotitations in case both settlements were seen as too extreme.  Rather than starting the process completely over she ordered both sides to discuss POSSIBLE compromises.  If you think she can't inforce it maybe you'd like to discuss antitrust laws with her.  Either that or you should look into two little things called the Tunney Act and the Sherman Act.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the order being vague, if you read the article (from The Register) and the transcipts from the hearing (which you obviously didn't) the order was quite clear.  Microsoft doesn't have to comply but it's rather stupid as the judge has the ability to throw out the MS-DoJ deal and accept the states or come up with something herself (she is not limited to either).  It's like shooting yourself in the foot.  I suggest you do a little research into the case before shooting your mouth off and the read up on the Sherman Act and the Tunney Act while you're at it.
<BR>

<BR>
Now let's talk about repayment of legal fees.  You wrote that Microsoft MAY BE required to pay legal fees.  Although federal law mandates that corporations found accountable for violations of antitrust laws must reimburse the costs those states incurred for prosecution, they are not obligated to pay for litigation costs incurred by the federal government.  Shows how much you know about "the law".  
<BR>

<BR>
Another item you touch on is the appeals process.  There is no appeal.  Microsoft has been found guilty.  The trial is regarding the Microsoft violation of the Tunney Act as well as it's undocumented meeting with various parties involved on going antitrust trial.  In other words holding secret back room meetings is a violation of the Tunney Act.  All in all (to make it so clear a 3 year old could understand it) it's to determine if the punishment fits the crime.  Once again, do a little research, ok?
<BR>

<BR>
As this is a phase in the trial to determine punishment Microsoft cannot appeal.  they have tried appealing at every turn.  Finally they were denied as there were no grounds for appeal.  This lead to the MS-DoJ settlement which the remining states (of those suing MS not all 50 dumbass) did not sign off on.  This once again shows you know very little about the legal system.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

Once you're in therapy, detikon, you will at some point find that you have transferred all of your fixation to a new father-surrogate, the one who is trying hardest to help you:  your analyst.  This is a perfectly natural, and often encouraging development, but you will never get that far if you don't get help!
<BR><BR>
Your screeching homophobia is just part of your psychosis, detikon.  This much is obvious to everyone but yourself, as you continue to labor under a self-imposed cloud of imagined father-persecution.  I'm sure it's very confusing in there, and I think I speak for all of us when I say I'd love it that fog began to clear.

The brighter users of <a href="/">Adequacy</a> are lauging their asses off at your attempt to insult me (of all people!) with accusations of mere anal and oral sex.  Guess what, detikon?  I consider that sort of stuff very tame, as you'd know if you'd been paying the least bit of attention to anything other than your imagined father-totem.  I suppose I've been a bit slack of late; this sort of misunderstanding would be much less likely if I'd made the time to finish <i>The Anal Sex HOWTO</i>.
<BR><BR>
Please do contact your lawyer immediately-- I'm sure that once he hears that an <a href="/">Adequacy</a> <a href="../../special/who.html">editor</a> has put a poll up at <a href="/">adequacy.org</a>, and that you would like to start a legal action over this, he will make every effort to help you get the treatment you so desperately need.<BR><BR><BR>

Now to the gay bullshit.  So let me guess.  Anyone who makes a refgerence to cock sucking or anal sex is gay?  What are you retarded?

The simple fact that both you and elenchos just LOVE to jump on the surrogate father bullshit constaly and discuss homosexuality at SUCH GREAT LENGTH shows that you may have issues of your own.  Perhaps the only way you can deal with your own issues is to "make believe" it's someone else with a problem.  This is not healthy and I suggest you seek help.  Go see a shrink talk about your probelms, cry like a baby, and maybe then you can think about rejoining society.

I'm not the one who brought up cock sucking and ass fucking, detikon.  That was you.  And you did so in a manner that suggests you fear your own emotional reaction to these things.

You know your emotional problems have reached a dangerous level, and you know you need help.  Why else would you keep coming back again and again to the people who are trying to help you?  We're happy to serve as an outlet for your uncontrollable anger, detikon, but you need to realize that this will only provide temporary relief, and that relief will, after a while, no longer be enough to keep your psychosis from doing great harm to you and those around you, unless the root causes are addressed.

Your characterization of teenagers makes it sound as if your own teen-aged experience was (or is) that of a social outcast, a condition most likely brought on by a false sense of entitlement and superiority, perhaps generated by an overindulgent mother and a weak father (that last is naturally vague and speculative, of course).

How about when they presented the same video that in the previous trial had been proven to have been falsified.  The states wanted to present evidence showing it DID work.  What did MS do?

Sorry but you can thank a few companies like Tandy and Apple for kicking that off.  IBM would later tap into the market with the PC-AT.  It wasn't until the PC-XT that IBM sold a computer with MS-DOS.

All pre-PC systems were little more than pocket calculators with big keyboards and monitors attached. Modern pocket calculators easily outperform those old machines.

Interoperability is crucial anti-monopoly measure. When the players are small, compatibility with the other companies is crucial for survival.

Forcing Microsoft to play fair will require a lot of effort; they don't have much more to offer than their market share and they know it. Without their grip on the customers, their market share will fall faster than a F16 after too close encounter with a surface-to-air missile. But they will still be able to do business in energetics; their marketing and PR departments can produce enough hot air to run a power plant.

<BR>

<BR>
As for lock-in schemes IBM was found guilty on 2 out of 3 occassions for the same thing (second antitrust case).  So was AT&T.
<BR>

<BR>
The MS-DoJ deal is a good idea in theory.  It allows for a party to monitor Microsoft's actions and decide whether or not they are playing fair.  However, through numerous loopholes, it not only allows MS to choose that pary but to choose itself and monitor itself.  Doesn't make a whole lot of sense now does it?
<BR>

<BR>
Imagine if IBM and AT&T got the same deal.  You wouldn't own your computer you'd lease it.  You wouldn't be able to buy anything for that computer unless you bought it from IBM.  Hell you wouldn't even own a computer because the only ones able to afford it would be coporations.
<BR>

<BR>
What if AT&T were the only telephone provider in your area?  You wouldn't own your phone you would lease it while remaining a customer of AT&T and pay outrageous fees.  If you bought a phone from someone else AT&T could cancel your service and take your phone.  Even the one you bought elsewhere.
<BR>

<BR>
People that remember know I'm not doing a "WHAT IF" here.  Ask your parents or grandparents about how they (AT&T customers) didn't actually own their phone.  You might even hear stories about when modems in the home became popular.  Reps went around telling people they could use them because they would damage their lines and equipment.  Some would tell people they needed to pay for an expensive service to use it.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><b>Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell script.</b><BR></FONT></td>

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">I actually read only parts of the proposals. It's dragging like OJ trial, wasting resources and producing paperwork instead of results. (Because of brilliant delay-as-you-can strategy of the main culprit.)

Regarding phone services, it was very similar here (and still quite is). However, a family of electrotechnicians with friends everywhere usually doesn't have to eat everything they're served; we had the access to the phone lines' and switchboards' specs (agents insiders (parents' classmates) between the telco techs), we knew how the Telco does line checking. So if the line parameters (ring current, DC and AC characteristics) are within tolerances, nobody can figure out anything from the outside. So we had two phones instead of one allowed, having a mini-party line, and couple more mods. So I later got an "unlicenced" modem - I was supposed to tell the telco, but as long as the signal is within the switchboards' specs, why they should know. Two years later when there were unrelated problems (on their own lines - on our segment we diagnosed and repaired anything within half hour) and they asked if I told them about the modem, I said I think someone done it and that it works flawlessly for years already - they believed as their paperwork is messy. 

Shame Microsoft's specs can't be accessed this way. Then there would be much less of problems - if they wouldn't give out the formats themselves, they'd be available anyway. I don't think I could be sued for using a format-shifting mail filter.

How do you get that offering to pay legal fees they already had to pay was quite reasonable?

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2">The problem that Microsoft is facing, is that the market for closed-source software is slowly dying.  Fewer and fewer companies are prepared to risk their data to closed formats that, next week, when Microsoft issue a patch to fix the latest Outlook exploit, they somehow cannot read any more.<BR><BR>
There is nothing new in the process by which free and open source software is gradually pushing closed source software out of favour.  Consider the "big iron" of the 1960's.  If you bought a computer then, it came with a special operating system, and a set of programs, designed and written by the manufacturer.  It was considered impractical for the customer to write programs for these behemoths, and in many cases, the hardware was specially customised for specific clients.<BR><BR>
Move on, now, to the late 1960's and the DEC minicomputers.  Here were machines where everyone could have a time-sharing terminal, and write programs themselves (in Fortran, COBOL or many other languages, some still with us, some, like RATFOR, long gone).  You still bought the OS and software from the manufacturer, but you could pay someone to write code for you, or write it yourself.  This situation remained more-or-less unchanged for nearly 25 years.<BR><BR>
The really big change took place in the mid-1990's, when public interest in the Internet really took off.  Since nearly all of the Internet servers ran some sort of Unix-y operating system (Windows could barely do TCP/IP at this point, but that doesn't really matter), Unix conventions became the standard for the Internet. Ever wondered why it's not backslashes for directory trees in URLs?  Linux was just an interesting student project, back then...  Now nearly all the servers that make up the Internet as we know it run some variant of Unix, be it *BSD, Linux, Solaris, or any of the other really wierd and unusual ones.  Windows is being pushed aside.<BR><BR>
The situation is akin to the farrier of the last century.  Imagine that you have a nice living shoeing horses for farms.  Gradually, more and more people are turning to tractors and machinery, instead of horses and hand-steered ploughs.  You have a choice.  You can shoe the horses that are left until your children starve, or you can learn to fix tractors.<BR><BR>
Times change.  It's a shame that Microsoft cannot manage to adapt.  Why should they be allowed to change and break laws to prop up their ailing business model?<BR><BR></FONT></td>

The biggest problem with microsoft is they think they should be the only company making OS software. or at least from the way they seem to like to bash other big names. 
<BR><BR>
but anyway, over all it seems like no one wants to move forward.. the internet makes companys less sellers of cds/software and more servicing firms ie: like Redhat, or other linuxy shops, which for companys that base themselves on how many cds are bought, it hurts them the most.. But I could be wrong
