      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">1.  Kill an Arab - In Arizona, Francisco Roque shot and killed Balbir Sodhi, while he was landscaping outside his business.  Do not trust "innocent" immigrants!  Sure, Sodhi, being from India, was neither Arab nor Muslim, but who cares?  He certainly wasn't a REAL American, like our man Francisco.<br><br>
2.  Sing "God Bless America" - Whether you're a corporate-sponsored legislator or a Wall Street hoarder, nothing proves your dedication to your nation like singing a song.  True, it was the abuses of these two groups that prompted the terrorist attacks in the first place, but so what?  They must be innocent.  They sang!
<br><br>
3.  Watch video replays of the inferno on CNN - Surprisingly, the variety of angles from which you have repeatedly seen two airliners plow into the ex-towers of the World Trade Center do not increase your knowledge one iota.  This is not information, but entertainment.  Similarly, photos of people leaping to their death are useful only as unit-shifters.  So grab some popcorn, set the VCR on extended play, press record and enjoy!
<br><br>
4.  Ruin someone's life - In these scandal-soaked times, it's good to see that CNN has not forgotten the power of libel.  CNN reported that Adnan Bukhari and his brother Ameer were two of the pilots who crashed into the former World Trade Center.  While their investigative techniques were above reproach, the truth of these accusations is doubtful.  Adnan is still living in Florida, and his brother died last year in an unrelated plane crash.  Kudos Ted Turner!
<br><br>
5.  Purchase a piece of official World Trade Center Shrapnel<sup>TM</sup> - Sorry to say, eBay has already pulled the plug on auctions of pieces of the WTC.  Don't worry, though, you're in luck!  Simply send me $3,000 and I'll mail you a piece of concrete that could very well have come from a building much like the WTC.(1)
<br><br>
6.  Fly the American flag - The House of Representatives recently passed a bill urging all Americans to fly the stars and stripes at home.  You can even download a free flag screensaver!  Fun fact: in recent years, the phrase "flag-waving" has become a synonym for pointless actions masquerading as legitimate ones.  I wonder why...
<br><br>
7.  Label all who oppose you - Look, it's simple:  If you believe in killing American civilians, you are a radical terrorist.  If you believe in killing Middle Eastern civilians, you are defending freedom.  Similarly, if you sacrifice yourself in a battle against a much larger foe, you are a coward, while if you hunt out pockets of lightly-armed militias with the world's most heavily-funded military, you are a brave leader.  Understand?
<br><br>
8.  Give an interview - National leaders, eyewitnesses, experts and incidentals have been furiously speaking to cameras throughout the rescue effort.  While some might say this accomplishes nothing, others would agree.  Of course, this will provide a wealth of footage for campaign commercials in years to come.  Joy!
<br><br>
9.  Join the Army - Unfortunately for the newly-shorn, a campaign against the military might of Afghanistan is likely to be short lived.  Your humiliation, hazing, and reconstruction (read: boot camp) will take far longer than the few weeks of carpet-bombing we have planned.  Do not despair!  We will no doubt be targeting another defenseless country of non-white people in the near future.  Hurrah!
<br><br>
10.  Make some money - Take a mediocre song.  Re-release it, but this time sample some timely news clips and run them during the bridge.  Don't worry that the song was originally a love ballad, and that the sampled clips are obviously tacked on.  Label the single "A Heroic Salute: &lt;song name&gt; WTC Remix 2001" and watch the cash roll in!
<br><br>
11.  Participate in a post-attack poll - Surprisingly, 97% of Americans polled had participated in a poll following the terrorist attack in NYC.(2)  39% reacted angrily towards the poll, 28% were sad, and 19% asked me to repeat the question.  An additional 14% were unsure, while a further 5% were extraneous.
<br><br>
12.  Kill an Afghan - While this may seem the same as killing an Arab (see #1) it's not.  An Arab is a member of any Arabic-speaking people, include countries such as Jordan, Syria and Malta.  An Afghan, on the other hand, is a citizen of Afghanistan.  Perhaps they don't speak Arabic at all!  For bonus points, try wrapping an Afghan in an afghan and beating him to death with the frozen corpse of an Afghan hound.(3)
<br><br>
There you are!  Now is the time to step up, be counted, and get behind America's effort to rid the world of terrorism (or at the very least, afghans).  After purging the world's terrorism, George W. has sworn to eliminate crime, traffic, and night worries.  Have no fear, Georgie, no one would dare call you a wimp after this!  We're behind you 100%!(4)

<br><br>
For example, make a statement that for every 1000 americans that die on american soil, an area the size of texas will be nuked, centered on the first group that thinks its not such a bad idea after all to kill 1000 people. And make it 1000, we want to make it hard for the kooks. For every building that falls down, 10 random American extremists will be shot, along with 1000 extermist middle easterners - I guess the're not that many moderates there. Also make it punishable by death to report on terrorism. See, all these things actually do something. God forbid we try a solution that actually works.<br><br>

The "Liberalist Regime" has never been in power in the United States of Amerikkka long enough to make a difference, but if we were, we'd pass a law making War and Violence illegal.
<BR><BR>
As an oppressed class, terrorists need to be treated with respect and dignity.  This is the policy of the "U.S. Liberal Regime" -- not violence.  We realize that USia is seen as an "evil empire" as you succinctly put it, and to counter this negative image we have encouraged many programs like <a href="http://www.affirmativeaction.org/">Affirmative Action</a> and <a href="http://www.projectmeal.org/">Meals On Wheels</a>.
<BR><BR>
Yes, George W. Bush and his cronies may have a stranglehold on our country now, but please don't think that all Americans share his views.  Myself and other members of the Liberalist Regime, Inc. are working hard to have him kicked out of office.  We are even hiring interns to seduce him (so far we've not been successful).
<BR><BR>
Of course there are a few minor exceptions to our policy of non-violence:  I for one encourage the killing of Americans, so long as they are white males.  Also, Palestinians.  Palestinians should be all killed.  Why?  Simply because the best way to end oppression is to kill the oppressors!

Muslims might not yet speak the language of freedom and democracy, but they understand the language of force. For example, when Syrian President Hafez al-Assad literally leveled the rebellious city of Hama in 1982, he successfully quelled the Islamic radical dissent; Syria has been free of internal strife ever since, a tremendous long-term gift to its citizens. Shouldn't we consider a similar approach?

Are you out of your mind?  You obviously have very little clue as to how the political machinery of the U.S. works.  The liberals in the U.S. have always been the ones preaching equality ("we all share the same world, we all breathe the same air, and we are all mortal.")  The conservative and fundamentalist types are the ones who believe that one American life is worth the same as 100 Arab lives.  This is because they (apparently) believe that we are the "chosen people" of various gods, jesuses, etc. and that we are superior to everybody else on the planet in virtually every way.  They are the ones taking notes on who isn't flying flags and singing "god bless America" and accusing anybody who questions U.S. policy of "treason."  If you had an ounce of sense in that god damned cranium of yours you would realize that your "liberalists" are actually your allies.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

It is the duty of any President (or any national leader, for that matter) to put the welfare of his fellow citizens against that of the rest of the world, but I don't recall Clinton ever demonstrating the level of amorality that you seem to assign to him.

This is insane stereotyping.  Thousands of innocent people die in one day in New York City and somehow we Americans, as a group, are collectively guilty?  This is just insane.  If you are going to make accusations against a people freshly wounded at least have the brains and the balls to explain yourself.
<br><br>
For the record, I think the U.S. government is making the only responsible and possible choice in trying to destroy the terrorists who did this, but that's just me. (Personally I think that there is a moral difference between intentionally targeting civilians and unintentionally killing people.)  My country is a plurality of opinions and it's baseless to say all citizens are guilty of wartime actions.

I'm not familiar with the other incident (bombing of the maternity home), but as you emphatically assert that it was no more a mistake than the Nazi's actions, I invite you to summarize the logical reasons why the perpetrators would have taken this deliberate action, including why it was the appropriate method, what goal it would achieve, and why this goal would outweigh the forseeable negative consequences, as well as providing some reasonable amount of concrete evidence supporting the existence of such a goal and the veracity of the deliberateness of the subsequent actions.

That is because he knew that by dying on the cross he would become a martyr. Martyrdom is a very powerful thing (obviously not as powerful as God but...). His death led countless millions down the path of enlightenment, guided by the religion that the his death helped create.<BR><BR>

No you jingoistic twit, If an <b>american</b> feels otherwise then he has an unwavering duty to make his voice heard in protest and to do something about it. <b>That</b> is what freedom is about, not some exclusionary, crypto-fascist, 'love-it-or-leave-it', redneck line of shit.

<i>That is because he knew that by dying on the cross he would become a martyr. Martyrdom is a very powerful thing (obviously not as powerful as God but...). His death led countless millions down the path of enlightenment, guided by the religion that the his death helped create.

<BR><BR>
What you know about Jesus couldn't fill a sticky note. He didn't do it for so quaint an ideal as simple martyrdom, he did it in order to take upon himself the sins of mankind. You disparage the religion and the man by overly simplifieng his sacrifice (and I say this as an atheist).
<BR><BR>
<i>It isn't hypocrisy, we can't all be martyrs. Some of us have to be soldiers.</i>
<BR><BR>
Oh? And where, exactly, did Jesus say that? Ah yes the fine Christian tradition of not knowing a damn fool thing about your own religion. His message was pretty damn simple and it takes some serious disingenouity to mistake it: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. See, it's easy and soldiering doesn't fit the bill. People like you make people like me atheists.

<i>Oh? And where, exactly, did Jesus say that?</i><br>
When God gave the law to the people of Israel through Moses in about 1500 BC, one of the laws was to do no work on the Sabbath. The Sabbath lasts from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday. When a man was found picking up sticks on the Sabbath in Numbers 15:32-36, God commanded the people of Israel to put him to death by stoning. Oddly, I agree with your assertion that God wants us to 'do unto others as you would have done to you' and He proves that in the passage above. Do you think that He would feel differently because we as a society have supposedly moved to some new, more enlightened, state of consciousness? No. Do you think He would command the death of a man working on the Sabbath but not one who takes the lives of innocent children? No, He is a vengeful God and He expects everyone to live according to His rules. If you choose to sidestep that responsibility, far be it from me to try endless attempts at reform.<BR><BR><BR>-------------------------<br>

Are there any educated protestants any more? Fundamentalism has really destroyed the movement as it was originated by Luther. Perhaps in Europe they remain true to their creed, but here in the States people calling themselves Baptists have turned the reformation on it's head with their Biblical inerrency. What happened to the priesthood of the believer? I think they really need something like the catechisms that Catholics use to learn of their principles.

That's what I like about Catholicism, it's got a plan, an angle, a system that's been refined for going on two millenia now.

That hardly qualifies as a destruction, leaning on such precarious ground as the interpretations of the catholic popes. The bible, like the Constitution, is written in fairly simple language and is meant to be 'interpreted' quite directly. Far too many people read far too much into the passages and thus lose their way.

<i>Far too many people read far too much into the passages and thus lose their way.</i>
<BR><BR>
As opposed to what way? You are obviously a protestant, personal interpretation of the bible is the very core, base, fundamental tenet of your sect. If you want someone to interpret it for you there's a Pope and a gaggle of Cardinals, Bishops, and Priests perfectly willing to do so. If you want to simply follow the Old Testement I believe the Jews are accepting converts too.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I think your usage of the word "sect" here is technically correct.  But it strikes me as odd.  Isn't "sect" usually applied to smaller groups?  After all any christian who is not a catholic is a protestant, right?  That's a gigantic group to be called a sect.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I'm going to cut and paste from my New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.  I wish I could afford the actual OED, but I cannot --> See my diary entry on shareware.
<br><br><i>
<blockquote>Protestant /"prQtIst(&lt;schwa&gt;)nt, in senses A.3, B.2 freq. pr&lt;schwa&gt;"tEst(&lt;schwa&gt;)nt/ n. & a. In senses A.4, B.2 also p-.</blockquote></i><br>
<i><blockquote>3 spec.a <b>Orig., a member of the Anglican Church as opp. to a Nonconformist. Later, a member of the Anglican Church holding Low Church views (opp. Anglo- Catholic).</b> E17.</blockquote></i>
<br>
I'm not exactly sure what they're getting at here, but apparently there are/were protestant anglicans too.
<br><br>
In fact, the dictionary gives a broader definition:<br>
<i><blockquote>2 A member or follower of any of the Christian Churches or sects repudiating the Roman obedience at the Reformation or of any of the Churches or sects standing in historic continuity with them; a member or follower of any of the western Christian Churches that are separate from the Roman Catholic Church in accordance with the principles of the Reformation. (Freq. opp. Roman Catholic.) M16.</blockquote></i><br>
Of course this leaves room for argument, but there always is.<br><br>
As for the monophysites, whose definition<br><i><blockquote>"A n. A person who holds that there is only one inseparable nature in the person of Jesus, contrary to a declaration of the council of Chalcedon (AD 451). L17."</blockquote></i><br>reminds me of the arian sect...  I would concur that you can't precisely call them "protestant."<br><br>Nevertheless, all this leaves my original point intact.  There are an awful lot of Protestants to call them a "sect."  Also, they may be a little to nebulous to be called a sect.

Bending it to fit a particular view that you already hold and interpreting its passages in an attempt to determine how you should live your life are two completely different things. As an example: I read Mark 16:17-18 and interpret it to mean that if my faith remains strong I will be able to handle venemous serpents without fear of harm. If I were already some sort of snake farmer, and I sought out that passage to justify my occupation, then I would be bending the bible to fit my lifestyle.<BR><BR>

And I haven't? If you have read the bible (or the Constitution) and you didn't understand them your mind must be terribly cluttered. Even a small child can understand them. Your writing seems to be coherent enough, I cannot imagine why you would have difficulty with either document. They are both very direct and meant to be understood according to their literal meaning. Both were written some time ago and may require a little vocabulary research but the basic meaning of the language hasn't changed all that much.<BR><BR>

I don't need anyone to interpret the bible for me, I have stated several times that is a simple read. The catholic pope has no more spiritual authority than any other man of the cloth.

The Founding Fathers, in their great (but finite) wisdom knew that this sort of argument would come up.  That's why our rights are <b>guaranteed</b> by the Constitution at all times ('cept when Lincoln says so).  There's practically nothing  in the Constitution that says that Americans are guaranteed their rights only when it is convenient.  To the contrary, it is when it is <b>most</b> inconvenient that we must be guaranteed our rights.  If life were wonderful and idyllic again (relatively), we would not need to have a sacred document reminding us of the basic principles of our nation; few people would feel the need to stifle others (ok, so I'm being optimistic here, but it would certainly be a more accepting climate than we have now).  That document is there to remind us of what we stand for when we are most likely to forget, namely a situation like this where it is convenient to ignore personal liberties.  I feel the most patriotic thing to do right now is to burn a flag to assert that you can.  Self-censorship isn't any better than imposed censorship (there's a quote from some court decision that says it better).  What was done to Bill Maher was terrible*.  Now is the most important time for you to assert your rights.  Nothing would be more American now than to reaffirm that our rights are not a matter of convenience, nor contingent on government and popular approval.  Being American isn't about blindly supporting the government; it's the exact opposite.

<BR><BR>

* not that I agree with him; look <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/int/2001/10/11/miller/index.html">here</a> for an interview that convinced me that Bill Maher was wrong.  But, for the most part, nobody ever constructively criticized what he said; instead they were appalled and outraged that he dared say something so contradictory to what everyone else thought.  Ari Fleischer (White House spokesman said:
<blockquote>
It's a terrible thing to say, and it's unfortunate," Fleischer said."There are reminders to all Americans that they need to watch what they say, watch what they do, and this is not a time for remarks like that; there never is." 
</blockquote>
<br>
That is very disturbing to me, the fact that a high-ranking governmental official (the voice of the President, in fact) would state publicly that Americans should censor themselves.  The furthest he should have gone would have been to say that the White House strongly disliked and disagreed with Maher's statement.  But they should have stopped short of advocating Bill Maher's restraint.  You don't eliminate ideas by banishing them; you let them out into the light and construct an argument stating why it was wrong.  The fact that Maher was forced to retract his statements destroyed an opportunity for dialogue on our merits vs. the terrorists' that would have (hopefully) resulted in the United States doing a better job of taking the high road henceforth in order to more clearly demonstrate the deep difference between terrorists and ourselves.  Unless you're afraid there is no difference, in which case our problems are way bigger than some late night talk show host running his mouth off.

2.  <b>Irony is my sword!</b>  When I say things with <i>irony</i>, they are unquestionably so!  You can tell when I'm using <i>irony</i> because I use an <i>exclamation point</i>!  Think of the <i>exclamation point</i> as your Guidepost to Irony!<br><br>


3.  <b>Attack positions no one espouses</b>:  "It is wrong to indiscriminately kill American Arabs/Moslems/Sikhs, even though the U.S. Government endorses exactly that!"  I am so brave for taking on the powerful pro-indiscrimiate-killing lobby!  Sure, sure, I know Bush bends over backwards to say the opposite, but I am so much more courageous if I pretend he didn't!<br><br>


4.  <b>Project my own beliefs on the actions of others, no matter what they say.</b>  Sure, many people of various political views <i>say</i> they fly the flag or sing "God Bless America" to express their feeling of communal pain or resolve, but I will project the most sinister of motives because it makes me look even more brave for opposing them!<br><br>


5.  <b>Tie everything back to my own agenda.</b>  Never mind the terrorists' <i>stated</i> agenda (U.S. bases in Saudi Arabia, humanitarian aid in Somalia, containment of Iraq) -- certainly it must be the same as mine, because that gives me the chance to say "I told you so" -- see how clever that makes me?  So, I say it is the excesses of Wall Street that caused this attack, and I say it's about time!<br><br>


6.  <b>Accuse everyone of a profit motive.</b>  I don't care whether they're donating all of the "profit" to charity.  Pointing out the Tacky makes me look petty, so instead let's pretend it's Greed.<br><br>


7.  <b>Blame the media.</b>  All those polls and interviews are so annoying -- they must be part of the problem <i>somehow</i>.<br><br>


8.  <b>Level the moral playing field.</b>  The terrorists (actually, I prefer the term "activists") were <i>right</i> to target evil, capitalist civilians; but the U.S. is The Evil Empire� for accidentally killing civilians when targeting the military.  This leads nicely into...<br><br>


9.  <b>There are no accidents!</b>  Each Afgan civilian killed and each suspect detained who is cleared were targeted <i>deliberately</i>.  Don't let anyone tell you differently -- that would make me less courageous & rebellious for standing up to this Evil Conspiracy!<br><br>


10.  <b>Berate the majority for labeling the opposition, while callously lumping them together in return.</b>  Don't tell me that most people were appalled at the sale of WTC rubble -- I need to lay that one at the feet of the majority!  All who support the war on terrorism also traffic in WTC rubble!  Say it loud, say it proud!<br><br>


11.  <b>Always lay the blame on the U.S.</b>  There's no glory in holding <i>foreign</i> murderers accountable for their actions!  It demonstrates great intelligence (and did I mention courage?) to deduct that such attacks are a "natural consequence" of <b>[insert fashionable pseudo-German term here]</b> imperialist, colonialist, capitalist, globalist, expansionist, un-hipist, attitudes of the West.  You see, you can't hold these people responsible -- they're like children or animals who only respond to what we adults do.  Oops!  Did I say that out loud?  That's supposed to be an <i>unstated</i> assumption...  I'm gonna blow my liberal credentials if I'm not careful...<br><br>


12.  <b>Use snappy numbered lists!</b>  Hey, I got this idea from <i>Cosmo</i> & <i>Men's Health</i>, and it works great!  Bite-sized quips, easily digested, with no careful analysis that might expose the folly of my arguments or -- God forbid -- diminish my obvious wit!

I'm not saying that some of their points lack merit, but not because they invested that merit themselves.

<td bgcolor="#EBEBEB"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" SIZE="2"><b>terrorism</b>: The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. <i>The American Heritage� Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</i><BR><BR>
"Any nation that supports, terrorism will share the fate of terrorists." - George Bush<BR><BR>
When the United States says it will bomb or attack a nation, because said nation is known to support terrorism then the United States' threat is a terrorist action.  The United States is a terrorist nation, no strong argument can be made against this.  For the United States to stop terrorism, as our politicians claim they want to in their rhetoric, they would have to refrain from bombing nations such as Kosovo, Iraq, Libya, etc., and avoid even threatening nations for political reasons.  They could do so, but it would be extremely difficult for them.<BR><BR>
When so many people use the word terrorism incorrectly(as is happening in lieu of the bombings), it is easy to not know the real meaning of the word. In context the mass media is using it people with little power who use or threaten violence are terrorists.  An entity with power such as the United States the way they are using the word is not considered a terrorist, yet none of the media caught this. Might does not make right, though.<BR><BR>
Many modern nations were founded by men who once considered terrorists.  George Washington when he used force to try to expunge British rule from America as general, was called by the British a terrorist.  They were correct in calling him a terrorist, I might add.  The word terrorist was borrowed from French.  The bourgeoisie revolutionaires in France who carried out the Reign of Terror against the aristocracy of France, were dubbed ' terroriste", by the aristocracy.  Those once terrorists in France are now celebrated as heroes, like George Washington now is in the United States, now that they can claim the legitamcy of a government.  Most of humanity does not have a problem with the use of violence, they have a problem when violence is used by a non status quo power.  When  Osma bin Laden uses violence/terrorism most of the Western world can recognize it is wrong, when the United States uses violence/terrorism they can not see it is wrong.  Only when we can recognize both forms of  terrorism can terrorism be reduced.<BR><BR>
