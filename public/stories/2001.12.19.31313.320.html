		I really do wonder if all the (and at this point the S**t hits the fan) Hackers/Hackerz/Crackers/Crackerz out there, who felt so strongly about Mr G's wonderful story, ever took the time out to think (this is where you use your brain and not your voice, using which ever spoken language your subconscious wants to use) about the following questions before getting all worked up:<ol></ol>

1. Just who is this guy?<ol></ol>
2. Is it really a guy?<ol></ol>
3. Perhaps this is just another freak story, created by somebody incredible funny and witty, just to see the response that it causes?<ol></ol>
4. != is not quite as annoying as people who insist on using �'s to make faces in their email.
<ol></ol>
On a personal point, even though I have little experience with computers compared to the historical escapades of the Hacker/Cracker who perhaps once hacked/cracked NASA just to turn a single letter around (is this a real story or just another urban myth?), I have managed (well I hope I have managed) to include line breaks, paragraphs or what ever you want to call them. And yes it did take 10 or so minutes to work it out, and yes it had loads of errors at the bottom when I was submitting, but I hope it works out OK, or it's just more crap I'll no doubt get later. 
<ol></ol>
Anyway, I look foward to Mr. Gibbons reply to this, as I look foward to all the abuse I'm no doubt going to get o�o

You say the article is untrue, yet fail to give even a single example, along with evidence to prove that said example is false.  Linux may be 'sweet' as you say, and you're entitled to that opinion.  In my opinion Linux is completely useless; all it allows you to do is run pseudo-unix on a system not designed for it.  If you want Unix, which is a good system for professional programmers, buy a computer designed for Unix and install a real version on it.  <br><br>
You claim that linux is used on over half the webservers in the world, but again fail to provide any support other than 'because I said so.'  Even funnier is your claim that linux is hard to hack.  I honestly cracked up on that one.  Linux is the easiest os to crack into, the only reason it isn't done more often is because it's not used very much.  Nobody cares enough about it to make it a target for hacking.  <br><br>
8 out of 10 computers, eh?  Is that supposed to be impressive?  Well, I don't actually refer to <i>my</i> toaster as a computer,  but that's your choice.  However many you really do have, though, it's seems like such a wast to use linux.  After all, there's absolutely nothing you can do with a linux system that you can't do on a windows system.  <br><br>
It looks to me like you're the one who needs to learn more about computers, rather than spouting off lies and unsupported accusations.  I get so sick of people who rabidly defend linux and yet to this day have not provided one convincing argument for using it as opposed to windows or macOS.   The part that really gets on my nerves is the fact that they portray microsoft as an immensly evil organization, when it's no different than any other sucessful company.  I don't see any linux freaks boycotting gasoline or not using a telephone.  <br><br><BR>As a child I wanted to know everything.  Now I miss my ignorance.<BR></FONT></td>

I just find it amusing that you rant on about "lack of facts" whilst making the counter-allegation that Linux is not useful - also with a lack of facts.
<br><br>

The facts are that determining Linux's usefulness (or lack thereof) requires a context; a person to whom Linux either is, or isn't, useful. Linux is useful to little Johnny, as it makes it easy to r00t b0x3n on the Internet from the comfort of Daddy's PC.

<BR>

<BR>
One comment was made saying "Linux is more stable". I don't personally use Linux for anything more than a learning/playing type of an OS. It runs on my secondary computer (not my seventh *innocent whistle*), and I just play with it every now and then. As for stability, it may very well be more stable. Windows is a quite complicated system of programs, which takes a -LOT- of programming, which most can't claim to be able to do. It's often overlooked as a "buggy" system, which is a shame. Any good coder will tell you that mistakes do happen. There's just no way to be sure that something is going to work 100% of the time for 100% of the population. Linux on the other hand doesn't require such a complicated code as Windows (keeping in mind it's a GUI [Graphical User Interface] vs. a "console" [DOS-type] OS), so it may be more stable, but it doesn't have the exact same features that Windows has, nor visa-versa. What Linux lacks in GUI, it makes up for in brute control. Linux, or any flavor of Unix for that matter, is an OS which gives INCREDIBLE control over the computer, and is also a true multitasking OS (well, I'm not so sure about Linux, but I know Unix is). Windows devotes a small portion of processing power to each task in a uniform manner so as each task gets a "turn" until it's completed, whereas Unix completes all tasks at the same time. 
<BR>

<BR>
So, just like choosing a car, it all comes down to how one wants to use the OS, the features the user feels comfortable with, and the basic tastes of the user.
<BR>

<BR>
So to claim one OS is better than another is a bit of an ignorant statement, as to one user Linux may rule supreme, and to another Windows is a must-have.
<BR>

<BR>
There's some facts, and a bit of a perspective change. Neat, isn't it?

Quite a bit of my time at home is spent on one or the other of these machines. Usually when I'm on one one of the kids will be on another.

I heard that Linus doesn't have the windows like Windows has, I heard that you have to get some other software to do the windows. To me, that would make you need more computers becuase if you wanted to write a letter and maybe play Solitaire at the same time you wouldn't be able to, becuase you would have only one window. That seems like a serious flaw to me and I can't imagine how anyone could say that Linix is as good as Windows when you can only run one program at a time.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

My son has 7 (3/Red Hat Linux, 1/Redmond Linux, 1/MacOSX Server, 2/WindowsXP).  He's a Network Engineer and she's a Systems Analyst.  The have four kids.  The computers are used for file and web servers, desktops for the kids and teaching tools for the older kids.  My son also teaches some neighborhood HS kids about networking (most HS tech instructors are uncertified dumbasses that have never seen a trackball).  He think it's a good idea to teach them about multi platform networks.<BR><BR>

<b> I heard that Linus doesn't have the windows like Windows has, I heard that you have to get some other software to do the windows.</b>

I think you mean Linux not Linus.  Linux is a <i>kernel</i>.  So yes it needs additional software.  Hell so do <i>kernel32, NTkernel,</i> and <i>NTOSkrnl</i>.  Can you guess what OSes those are for?  I'll give you a hint Win----. 

Linux distros that have a GUI (there are some that are task specific like corporate firewalls that fit on a floppy (do that with MS Windows)) have a very nice windowing system called Xfree86 or X11.  Most distros already include this.  They also include your choice of windows managers like KDE, GNOME/Ximian, etc.<BR><BR>

I believe that you are thinking of WinE which allows you to run Windows programs under Linux This is not to be confused with WinTel or VirtualPc which let you run Windows programs on a Mac. vmware also let's you run multiple instances of a OS on the same machine at the same time.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><i>Hey, if you consider the fifth grade your senior year, what else can you be besides a pompous jackass?</i>

Thridly: the reson why i have so machines is that i bought them cheap from my fathers work as they were upgradin there servers and these computers were simply to small for the load they were getting and were crashing frequewntly so , i took the chance of buying them to do something with them, aslo one off them runs our cable internet connection to the net and has bin up for 320 days now althought it doesnt do much werk the machine is good for stability and that is exactly what i like about linux, and sometimes my machine does get switched over to win2k for playing games as that is what windows is good for, so that is my reply.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
  Next, I would like to say point out the difference between White Hat and Black Hat hackers.  Black Hats are the vandals, also known as "crackers" who break into sites to destroy things, create viruses, and insist on poor grammar and spelling.  White Hats are the ones who have brought computer technology to where it is today.  Jobs could include programming, network administration, security consultant, antivirus researcher, engineer, etc.  To deny anyone's curiosity to learn about computing could hamper their abilities for a future career.  Like anything, there is a right and a wrong way to use it - only in this case the media has made EVERY individual who knows about computers into a black hat.
<BR>

<BR>
  I'll make a simple, not well thought-out analogy.  Law enforcement has many "tricks of the trade" and the laws themselves are so intricate that law school takes a while to get through.  A person who was so interested might be able to take their knowledge of the system and the abilities of the detective team in order to get away with a crime with relative ease.  To tell your child they are not permitted to read any detective articles in newspapers, magazines, or watch them on television would be silly - and for the same reason.
<BR>

<BR>
  It mostly comes down to morals.  I feel fairly confident I could break into several computers because I am a security expert.  However I don't because I actually learned some morals - if I ever did break into a computer I would do so for the purpose of notifying the owner.  Am I a criminal because I have knowledge?  No.  Knowledge is not a crime, neither is curiosity.  Crimes are crimes - and being a hacker is not one.
<BR>

<BR>
  You say computer hacking communities are the same as drug-dealer communities.  I must disagree for the same reason that hacking is not always illegal.  Drug-dealers on the street are generally illegal, but what about pharmacists?  Like nearly anything, there is a legitimate reason for most things.  Hackers have a legitimate purpose - they know more about computers than the average person... and that is probably why you fear them.  Either that or you are annoyed by the kids who prefer typing AnN0Y1nly and poorly ("U SUKC AND YU KNOW NOTHING ABUOT COMPUTARS!!").  They are everywhere and to be disliked by all; they are also not hackers.
<BR>

<BR>
  In closing, I would like to think I made a semi-decent argument for people to continue learning about computers ("hackers").  If you have an actual reason why the desire to know more about them is a bad thing, I would like to hear it.  If you are simply saying that the "script kiddies" and "crackers" should be avoided, then yes, I do agree.  They are the ones who help spawn the whole anti-hacker opinions in the first place.

Yes, some foolhardy companies, or outright criminal front operations, hire hackers and give them fancy titles.  But do we need to list all the times when they get burned?  From Dmitry Skylab to Kevin Mitnik, it's always the same story.

So go on believeing hacker propaganda if you want to, but that Gate Keeper crap isn't going to fly outside of your D&D game.<BR><BR><BR><i>I do, I do, I do<br>--Bikini Kill</i><BR></FONT></td>
