		Welcome, ladies and germs, to the first edition of my Hump-Day News Wrap-Up.<br><br>
As USian readers may know, <a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=hump%20day&lastnode_id=640592">Hump Day</a> is the day in the week at which everything either goes entirely to shit orcomes into focus for the rest of the week; on Hump Day, we begin to tentatively make our evening plans, to dream of the brief freedom of the coming weekend.<br><br>
For me, Hump Day is a great time to spew forth the news-based bile that has accumulated so far this week. This week's topic - Where is Chandra Levy?        </div>

      <!-- SIDE BAR END -->      <div class="q">Where <i>is</i> Chandra Levy, anyway?<br><br>
Probably dead. It's awful; as we keep being reminded though, it's only one of the disappearances that happen on a regular basis each year in Washington and around the country.<br><br>
As I am an avowed conspiracy theorist, my Chandra-watching thought process has been tinged with all the peripheral questions that do not get brought up by lawyers, police officers, Greta Van Susteren and other pundits, etc.<br><br>
For example: Why has <i>this</i> Washington romance, one of hundreds going on at any given time in the city, come to such a horrific end? There are many politicians who consider themselves dashing ladies men, many women who lust after them and their power, and many estranged wives that establish a tense, feigned ignorance.Rudolph Giuliani, for all his mishandling of the media dynamics concerning his breakup with his wife, has not allowed it to erupt into such a media circus. His career, while dented, is nowhere near as destroyed as Condit's.<br><br>
There must be something <i>different</i> about this particular Washington romance. So, let's ask some questions that haven't been asked.<br><br>
Someone may have waited for just the right time to kill or abduct one of Condit's paramours. Does Condit truly have a history of affairs, and is it a regular, easily monitored history? Would his enemies be able to choose a time to strike?<br><br>
Who would have the biggest interest in unseating Condit at this time?<br><br>
Who are Condit's contributors, and are they happy with his record?<br><br>
Who are Condit's allies and enemies inside and outside his party?<br><br>
Those are the <i>little</i> questions. Now here comes the big ones.<br><br>
Condit serves on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in the U.S. House of Representatives. He's also a founding member of the Blue Dog Democrats, a conservative grouping of Democrats in Congress. He's got the most conservative voting record in Congress of any Democrat, according to his own website.<br><br>
So, he's influential in the eyes of politicians and/or spooks. Was Chandra a political missile directed at Condit for dark reasons?<br><br>
It's an old intelligence tactic to use a woman to gain information from and pressure, through publicity threats, someone such as Condit.<br><br>
To explore this question, one should look at the history and origins of Chandra and her family.<br><br>
What were the politics and political connections of her family? Were these connections, or any other private or public connections, used to help Chandra get her Bureau of Prisons internship?<br><br>
Let's look for the "Linda Tripp" character, to parallel the Lewinsky affair for a moment. Who would Chandra have known at the internship that could have gotten her to talk about her relationship with Condit, raising the profile of the affair to the point that she would have been put at risk from Condit or his wife?<br><br>
Has Chandra any foreign connections in her family or among friends? Has anyone looked for her in a foreign country?<br><br>
And finally, why hasn't the mainstream media asked many of these questions?!<br><br>
I will be looking at these questions and others during the next week. I'd love your help, too!<br><br>
And now to introduce my soon-to-be famous sign-off saying:<br><br>
With the adequate story, this is perdida!<br><br>      <br><br></div>

They noticed that he was a Democrat (albeit a conservative one.) They thought it would be a good way to portray Democrats in a bad light. So they killed her (or had somebody else kill her) and then leaked the story about the affair to the media. BOOM! Instantly, the focus is on him, and everybody is talking about how he might have killed her. And Rush Limbaugh and Mike Reagan have new material for their shows. They can devote hours to talking about how "evil" those Democrats are, sleeping with interns and then murdering them.  After all, with Clinton gone they don't have a target anymore, and they've said everything that they can think of about homosexuals and blacks.<BR><BR>

IMO this is a new low, even for the right. This type of sleazy politics is bad enough, but when you start killing people the time has come to be locked up in a rubber room for good.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

DC is very much a boys club where the <i>IN</i> crowd rules the roost, and unless Condit was part of that crowd I can't imagine anyone killing his little chippy fucktoy to send him a message. I also doubt that she was using her vagina to try to get information from him to pass along to the dark side. She seems to be a power struck kid in DC who has a large enough bust line to get the attention of a politian who is ruled by his winky.<br><br>Levy is a better weapon alive than she is dead if you really want to damage him or control Condit. It would simply be a matter of getting plenty of film of the two of them together, maybe plant a camera in his apartment and get some XXX film, then you have some something to hold over his head. <br><br>As you speculate there are tons of politicians in DC who are doing the same thing Condit was doing and many of them are bigger fish he is. It would be pretty easy for the mob to find out who is fucking who and then go into attack mode if they wanted to, why start with Condit? <br><br>So what happened to her? We may never find out but I agree with you, she is very likely dead. Did Condit have something to do with the death? Maybe, he sure hasn't helped his cause be coming forward with information that might help find her. He seems more concerned with his PR than with her safety right now. But to be fair to him all we know is what we get from the media which is known for trying to sell advertising first and getting to the truth second. It's sad too, but the truth is if she was some plain looking girl next door and he was a gas station owner nobody would even care and we would have never heard about it.<BR><br><br>Best wishes,<br>--S.Q.

For her sake, I hope not, but the media is not asking any of the questions you pose, at least publicly so far, for obvious reasons.  If another politician or personality in the political arena wanted to get Condit, I agree with the earlier post that Levy would be more valuable alive and highly visible.
<BR><BR>If they produced her alive right now, that would be something, wouldn't it?
<BR><BR>Unfortunately, she was probably the victim of a street crime.  As Chief Ramsey was quoted in <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/597482.asp">Newsweek</a>, "The odds of her taking her own life diminish as time goes on, because you can't kill yourself and then bury yourself."  Although it is possible that Condit was involved in whatever happened to her, and he certainly is doing his best to make it seem that way, I think it is still unlikely.  So, to me, it seems that an all to common crime in D.C. is the reason for her disappearance.
<BR><BR>But, I guess it wouldn't be a consipiracy theory if it suggested a probable theory, would it?
<BR><BR>Hopefully we'll find out what happened soon so we can stop seeing the media lapping up, for the sake of ratings, something that will probably end with a very tragic result.  Maybe they should give some portion of the time they are using on Levy to stories about all the women who aren't rich enough or white enough to get plastered on tv after disappearing under mysterious circumstances.  I hope I don't sound too disrepectful or like I am making light of her circumstances, whatever they may be, but that's the way it is.<BR><BR><BR><i>It's all right to cry,<br>

<BR><BR><b>Ten Commandments' Sponsor Finds Demons Chasing Him
<br>By Robert Scheer

<BR><BR>How quickly the judges become the judged. Not so long ago, Rep. Gary Condit, D-Calif., was hectoring Bill Clinton on the need to come clean about an alleged extramarital affair. Now it is the congressman's turn to be evasive. But the implications, given the suspicious disappearance of Chandra Ann Levy, are far greater.

<BR><BR>The distance between adultery and the implication of murder is enormous.  Condit's spokespersons are right that the media feeding frenzy is fueling expectations of the worst kind.  But his alleged simultaneous liaisons with a  25-year-old intern and a flight attendant would suggest that we have yet another dreary example that the most self-righteous of our politicians might have the most to hide.

<BR><BR>Clearly Condit was declaiming against his own demons when he co-sponsored legislation calling for displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings.  How easy it is to forget the admonishment against adultery when it is not prominently posted at every turn in the Capitol.

<BR><BR>The argument typically advanced in support of the government's dabbling in religion is that the constitutional mandate of a separation of church and state erodes the power of religious truths and leads inevitably to a liberal, secular and amoral society.

<BR><BR>How then is one to explain Condit, who has been an evangelical Christian all his life?  There's nothing liberal or secular about him.  He's a strong pro-life, family values, Bible-quoting son of a Baptist minister who is rated highly by the Christian Coalition and flunks out with the ACLU.

<BR><BR>Don't blame his moral lapses on the influence of decadent Hollywood movies or the '60s counterculture.  Condit spent the first 19 years of his life in Oklahoma, attending tent revival meetings with his minister father and singing in a quartet on a Christian radio show.  When he moved to California in 1967, it wasn't to join a hippie commune in San Francisco but rather to accompany his father, who became the pastor of the Village Chapel Free Will Baptist Church in Ceres, a town in the conservative San Joaquin Valley.

<BR><BR>Condit was only 23 when first elected to the Ceres City Council and went on to become one of the most consistently conservative members of the California Democratic congressional delegation.  His is a pro-gun and pro-God combo that plays so well in the agriculture belly of California that four years ago no Republican candidate even bothered to oppose him.

<BR><BR>Condit's public commitment to conservative family values was underscored by his father's declaration three years ago that "I'm a very strong Bible-believing minister, and I believe with all my heart that God has had his hand on Gary because every time he was ready for a step up, a door opened."

<BR><BR>An equally strong endorsement was offered by the Rev. A. Dwight Burchett, California representative of the National Association of Evangelicals, who in 1995 hailed Condit as a stellar example of a revival of Christian presence in national politics. "America has been in desperate need of Christians in government leadership.  Real Christians.  Those who have been in leadership by and large have taken the American cultural experience down an 'anti-Bible' path."  He then offered Condit and Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri as two leading examples of evangelical Christians stepping up in Washington to turn things around.

<BR><BR>Condit's congressional performance did not disappoint. Not only was his voting record on social issues solidly conservative, he condemned Clinton's dalliances and he fortified his own morality by rigorous participation in a weekly Bible-study group.

<BR><BR>One of his Bible study classmates was then-Rep. Rick Lazio, who last year lost a Senate bid to Hillary Clinton.  When asked about Condit's troubles, Lazio said: "Gary Condit would be one of the last people I would imagine that I would find in the middle of a story like this."

<BR><BR>That could have been said of Newt Gingrich, Robert Livingston, Henry Hyde and Helen Chenoweth, just to mention the congressional Republicans whose denunciations of Clinton's moral lapse in the Lewinsky affair were followed by reluctant admissions of their own sexual transgressions.

<BR><BR>The revelation that sin is widespread in the ranks of judgmental politicians prompted the Rev. Barry Lynn of the Americans United for Separation of Church and State to caution that "Congress should probably spend more time obeying the Ten Commandments and less time trying to exploit them for crass political purposes."

<BR><BR>Politicians should also learn to deal honestly with the consequences of their temptations. Obviously Condit was so preoccupied with his appearance as a man of virtue that he did not act with virtuous haste and honesty in telling the police in a timely fashion exactly what he knew.
