		<p>Today, I was in a heated debate on <a href="http://chat.msn.com">MSN Chat</a> about the connection between atheism and crime. Simply by observing <a href="http://www.chsmemories.org/">atheists in action</a>, one can easily see that atheists tend to be violent sociopaths, but if I hated atheists simply on that fact, I would have been criticized as being "prejudice" and "bigoted." I would have to prove to them that atheism is accountable for all crimes on Earth. I have finally found the connection between atheism and crime.</p>        </div>

Anyway, I can see where that might be true. I think that, in my view, I'm just not sure either way what is going on. When you look at even the tiniest insect or animal, you have to appreciate that millions of things went <b>right</b> for it to turn out the way it did (as far as DNA and whatnot). But I don't think that there is someone watching our every move. Besides, shouldn't we be able to make good decisions on right/wrong without God? If the answer is no, then we could be susceptible to moral relativism there, if what the Bible says is in conflict with the moral Absolute. This is where religion fails for me: how do you know that <b>your</b> version is correct, when (mostly) every culture has had religion of some sort?
<BR><BR>
I think that we should have a good base of ethics/morality without religion. I don't see why it isn't possible. You have to see it from my point of view: I sometimes get the feeling from deeply religious people that they would have no moral barometer if it weren't for the Bible telling them what God thinks is right/wrong.

Regardless, Fred Durst changing the lyrics to "Wish You Were Here" is blashpemy and should be punished with death. And I hate Pink Floyd.

The question of whether you have the "right" God is pointless -- we're talking about an omnipotent, omniscient creator of the universe here, not some sort of demiurge playing with a universe simulator.

I don't think it's a fair thing to say that atheists ignore their consciences. Like I said before, I'm undecided as to what is the Truth about the whole thing, but I've known plenty of atheists who lead moral lives. Of course, this is another flaw of religion--if you follow all of the ethics, but do it without the belief in God, then you are still amoral. How does that work?

Now, if you were talking about some sort of social and political (rather than a personal) concept of "ethics" -- then it's a whole other issue. In the words of Christ: "Render onto Ceasar what is Ceasar's". It means that personal and religious issues should not be confused with social and political ones. The vast majority of the time, they are unrelated. (Communists, in particular, always trip on this mistake. They think that an arrangement that ensures an ethical political system necessarily means that people will be ethical. Which is not true; quite the opposite most of the time, actually.)<BR><em><BR><BR>--<br>Peace and much love...</em><BR><BR><BR></FONT></td>

Not just that it's a true violation of anyone's human rights, but how are you supposed to keep tabs on them? How would the US (I assume you mean the United States, because the world would make even less sense) ban atheism? Of course, the government keeps track of religion, but what makes you think they wouldn't start lying after this bizarre prohobition took place? What should they do, force all non-Christians to convert and attend church, and make sure nobody has a non-Christian upbringing? That is FASCISM. And it still won't work. 
<BR>

<BR>
Now, about your proposal of banning non-Christian religions as well as Atheism. The two are completely different things. Sure, Atheism is a Non-Christian religion, but Atheism means no god, no afterlife, no higher being, no reincarnation, et cetera, whereas religions like Judaism or Buddhism do believe in an afterlife. 
<BR>

<BR>
Criminals' religious views are anyone's guess. What most people seem to agree leads up to something like a mass murdering is a person's extreme religious views and/or mental illness. The fact is we don't know what was going on in the minds of these people when they did what they did. If "Atheism" is the best excuse we've come up with for this kind of behavior this far, we need to research this further.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR>

<BR>
The fact is, most governments who begin to thrive under this rule FAIL because a group who does NOT believe everything they are fed and questions will make everyone else do so as well.  As the quote I cannot realate properly to the person who said it states: "People are always aware they are subset by tyrrany, most, however, are afraid to question what they do not understand enough to disbelieve."  Basically I'm saying that in any tyrranical government, you will always find a human or group of humans that will overthrow you.  Corruption is always destroyed by anti-corruption who is thus destroyed.  The balance of nature ALWAYS prevails.

This doesn't give sense. Either you mistakenly used "we" instead of "you", or you talk for other side than I think; in both cases, the actual mechanism of how it could be done remains mystery, and probably a snake oil.

This wish comes just from the frustration.
<BR><BR>
When Open Source will acquire its well-deserved victory, and there will be no subject that would contrinue in polluting standards and file formats, there will be no reason remaining to kill Bill; the right moment was missed by over a decade anyway.
<BR><BR>
After all, by then he will be a broken old man, whose dreams of ruling the world will be shattered forever.
<BR><BR>
Quick death is too good for him - he will die anyway. What he deserves is having to watch his imperium crumbling in his hands.

According to what I seen, atheism is "belief that there is no deity".
<BR><BR>
The arguments used by atheists are effectively proving that existence of any god(s) can't be confirmed. This is correct. The incorrect part is that it proves that god(s) don't exist.
<BR><BR>
As far, I was unable to find arguments for both confirming and denying the existence of deities. So I consider atheism a religion of its own, a belief there is no god.

I thought it is quite narrowly defined, as the belief that it is not possible to know if there is or is not a God.
<BR><BR>
<i>Personally, though, I think it is a bit of a cop out. Saying "I won't choose" sounds weak of character.</i>

Not necessarily, when the choice is irrelevant.

<BR><BR>
Then the choice is irrelevant.
<BR><BR>
Tangent: Saying no choice is cop-out is in various form addressed to people that don't vote. What if it isn't? What if the choices resemble the choices in the poll of the <a href="./2001.12.28.55410.553.html">Internet licences</a> story and don't offer any acceptable choice for you? Why there is not an institution of "protest vote" that would say "I cast my vote and I hereby declare I don't like any of the proposed choices"? This could quite shatter the voter turnout statistics, especially if high number of these votes would have more than just informative meaning...

<BR>
(Derived from Marriam-Webster's Dictionary and findings of my own)
<BR>
From www.dictionary.com:
<BR>
a�the�ism (th-zm)
<BR>
n. 
<BR>

<BR>
Disbelief in or denial of the existence of God or gods. 
<BR>
The doctrine that there is no God or gods. 
<BR>
Godlessness; immorality
<BR>

<BR>
a�the�ist (th-st)
<BR>
n. 
<BR>
One who disbelieves or denies the existence of God or gods
<BR>

<BR>
( the A of these pronounceation keys have been left off for some odd reason )
<BR>

<BR>
Word breakdown:
<BR>
Atheism is broken down as:
<BR>
a- prefix meaning without
<BR>
theos greek for gods ( or adapted to fit also god)
<BR>
-ism suffix meaning having or containing
<BR>
thus atheism means:
<BR>
being without god(s).
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Agnostic:
<BR>
Someone who denies the ability of one to know whether the existance of any God or Gods is even POSSIBLE, let alone make any reasonable or knowledgeable presumption along with these findings.
<BR>
( Devired from Marriam-Webster's Dictionary and my own findings, being an Agnostic )
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Also, from www.dictionary.com:
<BR>
ag�nos�tic (g-nstk)
<BR>
n. 
<BR>

<BR>
One who believes that it is impossible to know whether there is a God. 
<BR>
One who is skeptical about the existence of God but does not profess true atheism. 
<BR>
One who is doubtful or noncommittal about something. 
<BR>

<BR>
adj. 
<BR>
Relating to or being an agnostic. 
<BR>
Doubtful or noncommittal: "Though I am agnostic on what terms to use, I have no doubt that human infants come with an enormous `acquisitiveness' for discovering patterns" (William H. Calvin). 
<BR>

<BR>
Just for some worthless background:
<BR>
The word agnostic comes from the work Gnostic, which means Knowledge or knowing of supernatural beings, the a- prefix means without, such as the word agnostic is supposed to mean 'without spiritual knowledge.'  He also coined the phrase: " a man without a rag of a label to cover himself with"
<BR>

<BR>
That should clear up any confusion that either I or others might have had during any of these discussions.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

I do <i>not</i> "believe that there are no gods".  A small quibble, but one that most atheists, including myself, feel is important to clarify.

<BR><BR>One can also go a step further and demonstrate that there are two forms of atheism-- weak (implicit) and strong (explicit).  Weak atheism simply means "not theist", and some may argue that this definition also includes agnostics.  Strong atheism (closer to my personal understanding) explicitly denies the existence of any gods--a position that will usually require support at some time.

<BR><BR>Agnosticism means, simply, "without knowledge" (it is not a "wishy-washy" standpoint on theism or atheism, mind you, and many agnostics are offended by the Pascal's Wager-type view many people have with regard to agnosticism).  Likewise, agnosticism can be categorized as weak (without knowledge of any gods, but not excluding the possibility of the existence of any gods) and strong (the claim that it is impossible to know whether any gods exist).  I will argue that agnostics <i>have</i> chosen-- they have chose to not say definitively either way that any gods do or don't exist.

<BR><BR>Mad Scientist's miswording is what leads to the oft used, and fallacious, argument "isn't atheism also a religion?", meaning that atheism is a belief system based on the assumption that there aren't any gods.  Rather than give you a lengthy answer here, <a href="http://atheism.about.com/library/weekly/aa030499.htm">this</a> article clears things up quite nicely.  I'm still willing to answer any resulting questions, however.

<BR><BR>Note that atheism is not a religion, but neither are agnosticism or theism for that matter.  The confusion of "religion" with any concept has to do with the possible existence of god is common mistake, but a mistake nonetheless .

<BR><BR><i>If there is a Christian-esque God, Agnostics and Atheists will have both refused to accept Him, and can really be lumped together, and if there is no God, they are both dead in the end and it doesn't matter.</i>

<BR><BR><ol><li>The denomination of the god in question is irrelevant: Atheists have no belief in <i>any</i> god, be it the Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu, Aboriginal, et al, god or gods.  Agnostics have no knowledge of the existence of any gods, and again, <i>which</i> god, be it the Christian god, etc., is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Atheists and agnostics have not "refused to accept" any gods.  Atheists have no belief in any gods.  Agnostics have no knowledge of any gods.  I hope this is becoming clearer.</li>
<li>Everyone dies in the end, regardless of whether any gods exist, and regardless of our individual atheism, agnosticism or theism.  Belief or non-belief in any gods has nothing to do with the biological state known as "death" to which all living organisms are subject. Whether or not one spends time believing in any gods while <i>alive</i> is the topic.  And it would seem to matter very much if, a: A god or gods exist, and all humans who die are subject to said god'(s) post-death... itinerary, or b: No god or gods exist, and after death all humans simply cease to live.  There is no "after life", and humans are not subject to said god'(s) judgment as to where one will spend "eternity".</li></ol>

The first is that atheists and agnostics tend to be more intelligent and affluent than theists in general, which in turn reduces their need to rely on violent crime in order to support themselves.  The second is that some believers have a mindset wherein they have a cosmic "get out of jail free" card, and if they misbehave, all they have to do is ask forgiveness and all will be well.  In a small number of these people, this may delude them into thinking that they can get away with crime.<BR><BR>

Now there are exceptions to every rule, of course.  Lots of theists are intelligent and affluent, and there are some atheists that are complete morons.  As a general rule, however, the statistics are not with you.  You would have to explain why the areas of the country that are the most religious (places in the Deep South like Mississippi and Alabama) also have among the highest per-capita murder rates, the highest incidence of domestic abuse, substance abuse, petty theft, illiteracy, teen pregnancy, etc.  I'm not saying that it's because of religion, but I do think it's obvious that religiosity isn't helping things all that much, either.<BR><BR></FONT></td>

<BR><BR>Would you mind showing us where the "vast majority of the scientific community" presented these "studies"?   Were these studies featured on the `700 Club', by any chance?  And how did they get this information from babies and small children who are physically unable to verbally say, "Hey, scientist dude.  I'm having an innate sense of the supernatural.  Make sure to mark this down for your 'study'"?  Were finger paints involved?

<BR><BR>And how does that account for <i>all</i> of the crime taking place in the world, even as we speak, since children know these things at such an early age?  Did they forget about it as they got older?  Are all criminals atheists?  Should we ask all of them and make sure?  If all children have a "sense of god" at an early age, how does that account for the existence of atheists, who do not have this... um... sense ?

<BR><BR>Inquiring minds want to know.  After all, if all children have an "indication of what is right and what is wrong", as you say, why then do parents put so much time into correcting, shaping and disciplining their children's behavior while teaching them "right from wrong"?  Were my parents misinformed?  Was there a big parental memo that they didn't read?  <b>"Your children know right from wrong!  They already believe in god!  Stop your parenting and go take a much needed vacation <i>now</i>!"</b>  Which is a shame, 'cause they could have used a break from parenting three children, poor folks.

<BR><BR>Oh, and P.S. -- I am an atheist and I have never broken a law in my life.  Not even a traffic violation.  No atheist I personally know has ever broken any laws either, now that I think about it.  Not to say that there aren't atheists capable of breaking laws-- by gum, after all they <i>are</i> as human as theists, despite their non-belief, and are capable of making mistakes.  So does this make us the exception to the rule?  Are we freaks of nature or just closet Christians, as Christians are apparently incapable of breaking laws?

This statement flies in the face of logic.  If you are an atheist, you believe that you have 80-odd years on this Earth, and that's it.  Jail is the worst possible way to spend 5%, 10%, or more of this precious time.  A truly repentant theist might hope for a new chance in the afterlife, but an atheist has no such recourse.

"As everybody knows, people are born not believing in God"

Also, in disagreeing with this statement, are you not dismembering the whole previous author's argument? It seemed to me that the statement was the basis of the whole connection that the author drew.

While he later renounced his Christianity and openly ridiculed Christians, he never denounced the existence of any gods-- which is what it takes to be an atheist, sorry to inform you.  In fact, Hitler stated:

<BR><BR><i>"We were convinced that the people need and require this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out."</i> (Norman H. Baynes, ed. <i>The Speeches of Adolf Hitler</i>, April 1922-August 1939, Vol. 1 of 2, Oxford University Press, 1942)

<BR><BR>I find it hard to believe that a self-congratulatory person such as Hitler could be an atheist and not shout his atheism from hill to yonder, as he did with so many of his "ideals".  Had he been atheist, don't you think he would have forced atheism upon those who followed him?  In fact, Hitler often claimed that his "racial cleansing" was fulfilling god's "will", a manifest destiny of sorts, that paved the way for the "pure" Aryan race to take over the Earth.

<BR><BR>Crazy, definitely.  Evil, perhaps.  Atheist?  Unless you can show me more compelling evidence than "He had no morals, therefore he was an atheist", I will have to disagree with you.  The thought of a Hitler who believed in a god must be quite outlandish to you, Messiah, but I assure you that bad people come in all shapes and sizes... and belief systems.

You've, in doubtedly, proven that you don't believe in God.  Why?

Tell me, do you TRUELY understand your god?  Do you understand his ways and his existance?  can you explain his whereabouts exactly and not give some worthless relation like "heaven."  No one can EVER understand a being that is ominipotent.  How could you?  He's ominipotent, nothing he does could EVER make sense because of that fact.  He lives unbiasly, you have biases.

<BR><BR>Although you insist on children being atheist, which at the most would make them "weak" atheists (not believing in any Gods, or a person who does not happen to be a theist), wouldn't <i>agnostic</i> be the better term?  "Without knowledge of God" seems to make what you are trying to say <i>jibe</i> with the conclusion you are trying to make, more so than "not believing in any Gods".  The latter implies that the child would have to have some knowledge of God in order to not believe in one, and assumes that babies and young children have the reasoning skills to differentiate between "believing" and "not believing".  When, I believe <i>most</i> scientific studies have shown, most young children are incapable of this type of abstract thinking and symbolic construction until the ages 12 and up-- the Formal Operations stage (Erickson and Piaget might have more valuable insight on this).  So would that have made <i>all</i> of us atheists, then, if we are incapable of abstractly reasoning the concept of atheism until this stage (one would have to believe in God in order for another to <i>not</i> believe in God).  How would that account for most children patterning their belief systems on that of their parent's (when they are capable of concrete reasoning-"what is, <i>is</i>"- at ages 7-12)?  Your input would be nice.

<BR><BR>Oh, and sir?  Atheists are capable or reading and discerning things just as capably as anyone else, regardless of their non-belief.  But, just like others, we might see things with which we disagree and feel that giving our opinion is necessary, though it might be an opinion with which you disagree.  But answering questions in the manner you are given does not make for productive discussion.  Didn't the Bible teach, "Do unto others as you would have done unto you"?  I can hardly see where being rude to people and making snide, generalized comments makes one a true, loving, <i>moral</i> Christian.

Personally I am Catholic, and can't help believe that my way is best, but I do think that that there are other less direct direct ways to God, Heaven, ect.  
<BR>

<BR>
The majority of the Protestant sects are also on the right track, though they strayed (quite understandably) back when the Church sucked.  I respect people who have the courage to cast off their old ways when those become unacceptable, even if I don't like the new idealogy that they replace it with.  Now, however, I don't see any reason why Protestants can't come back to the original way.
<BR>

<BR>
The Jews are cool: they were the original chosen people, and that counts for a lot, as far as I am concerned.
<BR>

<BR>
In addition, I think that the far eastern religions are pretty cool.  Hinduism and Buddhism are in teresting that they don't hold with the monotheism of most of the world, and but still embody almost the same "be good" attitude.  Also, they have a much better record of collective violence.  The Catholics had the Crusades, The Protestants had the Know Nothing Party ( pardon the generalization ), and Islam has it's fundamentalist Jihads.  Compare that to the Eight-fold Path, and the monotheists come up a bit wanting.<BR><BR></FONT></td>
